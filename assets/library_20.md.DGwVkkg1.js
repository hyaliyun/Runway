Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: I'm a true fan of the original Cracker series, and own all of them on DVD. Cracker had a tendency to be over-the-top on occasion, but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members, as well as the writers, always seemed to carry it off despite themselves. I count the original Cracker among the great Brit TV crime series of that time, and there's some stiff competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes, and a host of others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was on the top of my list. Which makes \\"A New Terror\\" all the more sad... Ultimately, this was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing, convinced that it couldn't actually be this bad, and that some spark would eventually ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from beginning to end. A few criticisms: First, just to get any potential bias up-front right off: I was offended by the anti-American, anti-war screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show. The topper: the murder of two American's innocent of any crime and a British Junkie is, in Fitz's words, \\"understandable, but not justified\\". I thought \\"I waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel?\\" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war/American tone brought on by my beliefs... Beyond the politics, I had the distinct sense that this Cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda, and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak script. Second, just how much air-time did Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a bit player in this one, as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of Fitz's role. Coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders, but the writer was apparently thinking of other things, and missed the chance, and by a wide margin. Third: WHAT AN ABYSMAL SCRIPT! There was some sparkle, and a couple of bits of actual character development (Fitz's son ranting that Fitz couldn't stay at his house if he missed his plane to Australia, the Detective that liked to beat his poor-performers over the backs of their heads, and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his Missus) but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline.  Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now that would have been interesting... It was Manchester after all, and 10 years on she'd be up in the ranks. Another wasted opportunity (or perhaps the actress wasn't interested?)  Well, there's much more (that's bad) to say , but I'll close with a curiosity: at the end of the show (as it aired on BBCA), when the advertisement announced that the \\"Director's Cut\\" was available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! The Director's cut, which, presumably, one has to pay for, might have all of the goodies I expected to see tonight but never did, like a coherent, interesting storyline. Unfortunately, after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of \\"A New Terror\\" with the hope of seeing something, anything, worth watching, only to be disappointed, I have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second, potentially longer and more tedious version. Besides, it angered me to think that BBCA sliced and diced, and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless (every ten minutes or so) stream of commercials, and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight. To close, I quote the first paragraph of Variety's review of \\"A New Terror\\": it really says it all: \\"Initial excitement about Robbie Coltrane reprising his role as the BBC's flawed, boozing, womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavy-handed political statement writer Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic. Jolting at first in its message -- namely, that Americans are a bunch of whiny namby-pambies who didn't care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep -- McGovern's chest-clearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing Fitz back on the case.\\"","output":"The sentiment of this text is mostly negative. The person writing it seems to be disappointed with the \\"A New Terror\\" version of the Cracker series, as they think it is a weak imitation compared to the original. They criticize the political message, the script, the lack of focus on Robbie Coltrane's character, and other aspects of the show. They don't seem to enjoy watching it and express their frustration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar ( ( listen); born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team, regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. The highest run scorer of all time in International cricket, Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003-04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease.India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test. Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests. It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.  Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests. Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste. After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.  A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004. He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2-1.  On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007. Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan. He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory. On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd, the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.  Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century. Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.

Additionally, this subject can be found in North America. The main focus here is the fact that Packard contributed to the description of the subject, and the discovery of the subject's geographical location (North America) is a secondary piece of information. In the second sentence: \\"It was found by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is described in North America.\\" This sentence suggests that Alpheus Spring Packard himself discovered or found the subject in 1874. Furthermore, the subject is described in North America, implying that there may be documents, studies, or records that exist within North America that describe the subject. The focus in this sentence is more on Packard's role in finding or discovering the subject, and less on his contribution to describing it.

The studies provide a missing link in the puzzle that has connected naval exercises around the world to unusual mass strandings of whales and dolphins.      Beaked whales, the most common casualty of the strandings, were shown to be highly sensitive to sonar. But the research also revealed unexpectedly that blue whales, the largest animals on Earth and whose population has plummeted by 95% in the last century, also abandoned feeding and swam rapidly away from sonar noise.      The strong response observed in the beaked whales occurred at noise levels well below those allowed for US navy exercises. \\"This result has to be taken into consideration by regulators and those planning naval exercises,\\" said Stacy DeRuiter, at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, who led one of the teams.      \\"For whales and dolphins, listening is as important as seeing is for humans – they communicate, locate food, and navigate using sound,\\" said Sarah Dolman, at charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation. \\"Noise pollution threatens vulnerable populations, driving them away from areas important to their survival, and at worst injuring or even causing the deaths of some whales and dolphins.\\" Dolman said there were no accepted international standards regarding noise pollution and there was an urgent need to re-evaluate the environmental impacts of military activities.      The US Navy part-funded the new studies but said the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm. Nonetheless, Kenneth Hess, a US Navy spokesman, said permit conditions for naval exercises were reviewed annually and added: \\"We will evaluate the effectiveness of our marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings.\\"      Unusual mass strandings, where multiple species of whale and dolphin beach at several locations at once, have soared since the introduction of military sonar in the 1950s and can be fatal. The strandings occur every year and major recent events saw up to 15 animals beached in the Canary Islands, the Bahamas and Greece. In May, the naval activity was found to be the most probable cause of the deaths of at least 26 short-beaked common dolphins in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall in June 2008.      Beaked whales are the most common species affected by unusual mass strandings, perhaps because their shy nature makes them more easily scared by noises that they may interpret as killer whale sounds. Researchers used suction cups to attach digital devices to Cuvier's beaked whales off the coast of Southern California to measure the noise they were exposed to and their response.      When a simulated military sonar signal was sounded at 200dB and between 3km and 10km away, the whales initially stopped feeding and swimming. They then swam rapidly away from the noise and some performed unusually deep and long dives. \\"The missing piece of the puzzle was how whales changed their behaviour and how that led to mass strandings,\\" said DeRuiter. She added that they also stopped feeding for 6-7 hours, which is unusual. \\"If they miss out on food, they will be less healthy,\\" she said, noting that where populations have been measured, numbers of Cuvier's beaked whales are declining.      A second study, also off Southern California, estimated that a blue whale spooked by the sonar missed out on over a tonne of krill, about a day's worth of food. \\"Blue whales rely on large aggregations of dense krill to sustain their extreme body size, so they continuously dive and feed throughout the day when high-density prey patches are present,\\" said Jeremy Goldbogen, at Cascadia Research, a non-profit US research organisation in Olympia, Washington. \\"Because of this, we suggest that sonar-induced disruption of feeding could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on individual baleen whale fitness and the health of their populations.\\"      A spokesman for the UK's Royal Navy said: \\"The Royal Navy already limits its use of sonar around whales. We are committed to taking all reasonable and practical measures to protect the environment and mitigate effects on marine mammals. This new research will be taken into account in the regular review of MoD active sonar mitigation procedures.\\"      • This article was amended on 3 July 2013 to clarify the claims made by the US Navy, which part-funded the new studies. ||||| Duke research scientist Ari Friedlaender plants a suction cup tag on the back of a blue whale off the coast of Southern California. Credit: Ari Friedlaender, Duke Marine Lab (NMFS Permit 14534) Some blue whales off the coast of California change their behavior when exposed to the sort of underwater sounds used during U.S. military exercises. The whales may alter diving behavior or temporarily avoid important feeding areas, according to new research.      The Southern California Behavioral Response Study exposed tagged blue whales in the California Bight to simulated mid-frequency (3.5-4 kHz) sonar sounds significantly less intense than the military uses.      \\"Whales clearly respond in some conditions by modifying diving behavior and temporarily avoiding areas where sounds were produced,\\" said lead author Jeremy Goldbogen of Cascadia Research. \\"But overall the responses are complex and depend on a number of interacting factors,\\" including whether the whales were feeding deep, shallow or not at all.      The study, funded by the U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Environmental Readiness Division and the U.S. Office of Naval Research, appears July 3 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.      The scientists tagged the whales with non-invasive suction cups, which recorded acoustic data and high-resolution movements as the animals were exposed to the controlled sounds.      \\"The tag technology we use offers a unique glimpse into the underwater behavior of whales that otherwise would not be possible,\\" said Ari Friedlaender, a research scientist at the Duke Marine Laboratory.      The scientists found that some of the whales engaged in deep feeding stopped eating and either sped up or moved away from the source of the noise. Not all of the whales responded to the noise, and not all in the same way.      \\"Blue whales are the largest animals that have ever lived. Populations globally remain at a fraction of their former numbers prior to whaling, and they appear regularly off the southern California coast, where they feed,\\" said John Calambokidis, one of the project's lead investigators of Cascadia Research.      That area of the ocean is also the site of military training and testing exercises that involve loud mid-frequency sonar signals. Such sonar exercises have been associated with several unusual strandings of other marine mammal species (typically beaked whales) in the past. Until this study, almost no information was available about whether and how blue whales respond to sonar.      \\"These are the first direct measurements of individual responses for any baleen whale species to these kinds of mid-frequency sonar signals,\\" said Brandon Southall, SOCAL-BRS chief scientist from SEA, Inc., and an adjunct researcher at both Duke and the University of California Santa Cruz. \\"These findings help us understand risks to these animals from human sound and inform timely conservation and management decisions.\\"      A related paper published July 3 by the same research team in Biology Letters has shown clear and even stronger responses of Cuvier's beaked whales to simulated mid-frequency sonar exposures. Beaked whales showed a variety of responses to both real, military sonar in the distance and nearby simulated sonar. What the beaked whales were doing at the time appeared to be a key factor affecting their reactions.

The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., which was inspired by the article \\"Top Guns\\" by Ehud Yonay, published in California Magazine in 1983. \\"Top Gun\\" follows the story of Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell, portrayed by Tom Cruise, a talented and daring United States Navy fighter pilot who is sent to the prestigious Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School along with his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO), Nick \\"Goose\\" Bradshaw, played by Anthony Edwards. The film dives into Maverick’s struggle to balance his personal life and ambitions while competing against other skilled pilots in the challenging environment of the elite fighter pilot academy. The other named characters in the film are as follows: 1. Tom \\"Iceman\\" Kazansky: Played by Val Kilmer, he is Maverick's main rival in the film. Iceman is a skilled and disciplined pilot who consistently puts the team's success above personal glory, which often contrasts with Maverick's more reckless approach to flying. 2. Mike \\"Viper\\" Metcalf: Portrayed by Tom Skerritt, Viper is a respected flight instructor at the Top Gun academy and a former fighter pilot. He becomes a mentor to Maverick, providing guidance and crucial life lessons throughout the film. 3. Rick \\"Jester\\" Heatherly: Played by Michael Ironside, Jester is another experienced flight instructor at the Top Gun academy. He is known for his stern, no-nonsense approach to teaching and frequently challenges the pilots to think strategically during training exercises. 4. Bill \\"Cougar\\" Cortell: Portrayed by John Stockwell, Cougar is a fellow pilot and friend of Maverick. After an unnerving encounter with enemy fighter jets, Cougar experiences a crisis of confidence and decides to give up flying, which opens up a spot for Maverick and Goose to join the Top Gun program. \\"Top Gun\\" also features a romantic subplot between Maverick and Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Blackwood, played by Kelly McGillis, who is an astrophysicist and civilian instructor at the Top Gun academy. The film's adrenaline-fueled aerial sequences, memorable characters, and catchy soundtrack, combined with the strong performances from the cast, turned \\"Top Gun\\" into a major commercial success. It is still regarded as a classic and influential film in popular culture, and a sequel titled \\"Top Gun: Maverick\\" is scheduled for release in 2022."},{"instruction":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which potato was most likely stored in a warm environment?  A chef was recently taking inventory of his food when he noticed that identical potatoes were looking different. The chef had purchased them at the same time and they were the same type of potato, but had been stored differently and one of them had spoiled already. Potato A had spots of mold on it, but potato B seemed fresh and ready to cook. The chef was confused.  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.

On Friday night a tornado swept through a town north of us called Barrie, killing dozens of people and doing millions of dollars worth of damage. Sunday night, as I was coming home, I stopped the car when I got to Barrie. I got out on the side of the highway and looked around. It was a mess. Everywhere I looked there were smashed houses and cars turned upside down.  That same night Bob Templeton was driving down the same highway. He stopped to look at the disaster just as I had; only his thoughts were different than my own. Bob was the vice-president of Telemedia Communications, which owns a string of radio stations in Ontario and Quebec. He thought there must be something we could do for these people with the radio stations they had.  The following night I was doing another seminar in Toronto. Bob Templeton and Bob Johnson, another vice-president from Telemedia, came in and stood in the back of the room. They shared their conviction that there had to be something they could do for the people in Barrie.  After the seminar we went back to Bob's office. He was now committed to the idea of helping the people who had been caught in the tornado.  The following Friday he called all the executives at Telemedia into his office. At the top of a flip chart he wrote three 3s. He said to his executives, \\"How would you like to raise 3 million dollars 3 days from now in just 3 hours and give the money to the people in Barrie?\\" There was nothing but silence in the room.  Finally someone said, \\"Templeton, you're crazy. There is no way we could do that.\\"  Bob said, \\"Wait a minute. I didn't ask you if we could or even if we should. I just asked you if you'd like to.\\"  They all said, \\"Sure we'd like to.\\" He then drew a large 'T' underneath the 333. On one side he wrote, \\"Why we can't.\\" On the other side he wrote, \\"How we can.\\"  \\"I'm going to put a big X on the 'Why we can't' side. We're not going to spend any time on the ideas of why we can't. That's of no value. On the other side we're going to write down every idea that we can come up with on how we can. We're not going to leave the room until we figure it out.\\" There was silence again.  Finally, someone said, \\"We could do a radio show across Canada.\\"  Bob said, \\"That's a great idea,\\" and wrote it down. Before he had it written, someone said, \\"You can't do a radio show across Canada. We don't have radio stations across Canada.\\" That was a pretty valid objection. They only had stations in Ontario and Quebec.  Templeton replied, \\" _ .\\" But this was a real strong objection because radio stations are not very compatible . They usually don't work together. They are very cutthroat. They fight each other. To get them to work together would be virtually impossible according to the standard way of thinking.  All of a sudden someone said, \\"We could get Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson, the biggest names in Canadian broadcasting, to anchor the show.\\" (That would be like getting Tom Brokaw and Sam Donaldson to anchor the show. They are anchors on national TV. They are not going to go on radio.) At that point, it was absolutely amazing how fast and furious the creative ideas began to flow.  That was on a Friday. The following Tuesday they had a radiothon . They had fifty radio stations all across the country that agreed to broadcast it. It didn't matter who got the credit as long as the people in Barrie got the money. Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson anchored the show and they succeeded in raising three million dollars in three hours within three business days!

Earth’s rotation from west to east causes the stars in the sky, as a whole, to rotate from east to west. Which way the star has moved with respect to its original position where you sighted it tells you which direction you’re facing.  If the star rose, you’re facing east. If the star sank, you’re facing west. If the star moved to the left, you’re facing north. If the star moved to the right, you’re facing south.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: What are the odds of winning the UK lottery? To answer the first question, we must first understand the format of the UK lottery. The UK National Lottery, in particular, can be played by selecting six numbers from a pool of numbers between 1 and 59. To win the jackpot, a player must match all six numbers on their ticket with the six numbers drawn in the lottery. The odds of winning the jackpot in the UK National Lottery can be calculated using simple combinatorics. To calculate the odds, we can use the formula for \\"n choose r,\\" which is represented as C(n, r), where n is the total number of options to choose from (in this case, the 59 possible lottery numbers) and r is the number of elements chosen (in this case, the 6 numbers on a player's ticket). The formula for C(n, r) is: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) Where \\"!\\" denotes a factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) Applying this formula to our case, we get: C(59, 6) = 59! / (6!(59-6)!) = 45,057,474 This means there are 45,057,474 possible combinations of six numbers that can be drawn from a pool of 1 to 59. Therefore, the odds of winning the UK National Lottery jackpot are 1 in 45,057,474. --- Second question: What are the odds of winning this form of lottery? Without additional information about the specific form of the lottery in question, we cannot provide a precise answer. Each lottery has its own set of rules and guidelines that determine the odds of winning. Factors affecting the odds include the number of possible combinations, number of winning combinations, the prize structure, and many others. If you can provide the details of the specific lottery game, then a more accurate answer can be given for the odds of winning that particular lottery. --- To address the last part of the question, whether these two questions are asking the same thing: No, they are not asking the same thing. The first question specifically asks about the odds of winning the UK lottery, while the second question is more general, asking about the odds of winning a form of lottery that is not explicitly defined. As a result, the answers to these questions are different. The first question can be answered with precise odds based on the UK National Lottery rules, whereas the second question requires more information about the specific lottery format in question to provide an answer."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Choose from:  (A). glue them on with nail glue..  (B). glue them on with super glue.","output":"In this single/multi-choice problem, you are asked to choose the most appropriate solution among the given options to achieve the goal of effectively putting fake nails on. Let's analytically break down both options in terms of their suitability, convenience, and potential risks before arriving at the best choice.  (A). glue them on with nail glue: Nail glue is specifically designed for applying fake nails and other nail enhancements like nail tips and nail wraps. It is typically formulated with cyanoacrylate, a fast-acting bonding agent that offers strong adhesion and is safe to use on natural nails. This option ensures that the fake nails last for a long time, as the glue is created precisely for this purpose. While nail glue can sometimes cause damage to natural nails if not used correctly, it's still a much better option in comparison to a non-nail-specific adhesive such as super glue. Furthermore, nail glue is easily accessible and can be found at most drugstores, cosmetic shops, or online retailers. It is an industry-standard method and recommended by professional nail technicians.  Pros: - Specially designed for applying fake nails and nail enhancements. - Strong adhesion ensures fake nails are fixed properly. - Widely used and recommended by professionals. - Can be easily found in stores or online. Cons: - If not used properly, it can damage natural nails. - May require some care and precision when applying.  (B). glue them on with super glue: Super glue, also commonly known as cyanoacrylate adhesive, is typically used as a strong, fast-acting bonding agent for joining various materials like plastic, metal, wood, and more. While it is true that super glue's basic ingredient is the same as nail glue, its formulation differs and is not explicitly designed for use on nails. The use of super glue for applying fake nails may lead to numerous potential issues. First, such glue may be too strong, causing potential injuries or difficulty in removal later on. Second, it may also cause chemical burns or allergic reactions on your skin and nails. Third, using super glue may result in weakening and damage of your natural nails.  Pros: - It can bond materials quickly and strongly. Cons: - Not designed specifically for use on nails. - Potential for injury or difficulty removing fake nails. - May cause chemical burns or allergic reactions. - Can damage natural nails and weaken nail beds.  Based on the given options, the better solution for putting fake nails on would be: (A). glue them on with nail glue. This choice is safer, more appropriate, and recommended by professionals, as nail glue is specifically designed for the purpose of applying fake nails. It takes into consideration the unique needs and requirements of nail-related applications, ensuring better protection and care for your natural nails when compared to using super glue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\".  Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him.

While on assignment, a tribe native to the area takes him captive. Bradley starts in Bangkok, taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a boxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self-defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene. The next day, John begins his trip deep into the rain forest. He rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter.

The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.  When was the water level higher, in April or in March?  Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the water level in Large Lake was higher in April. In March, the water level was already high due to seasonal variations, such as snow melt and underground springs filling the lake during springtime.

The water level dropped to a much lower level in September, October, and November when a significant portion of the water was released as a yearly chore to prevent damage to docks and other structures, as well as maintain good water quality.

Question: When the camera zooms in on the ouiji board, what does it say Movie plot title: Witchboard Movie plot: One night at a party, Brandon Sinclair brings out his ouija board and attempts to contact David, the spirit of a dead ten-year-old boy with whom he has communicated numerous times. The spirit responds, but Brandon's nemesis Jim insults David, making the spirit angry and provoking him to slash the tires of Brandon's car. The next day, Jim's live-in girlfriend Linda sees Brandon's ouija board (which Brandon left behind from the previous night) and tries to contact David. It is revealed that the spirit is actually a ghost of a deceased murderer named Carlos Malfeitor acting under the guise of David. This malicious spirit initially starts being nice and helpful to her, informing Linda where her lost diamond engagement ring is. Meanwhile, at the construction site where Jim is working, his Lloyd is killed from fallen sheetrock by the murderous spirit. After Jim is questioned by Lieutenant Dewhurst at At Lloyd's funeral, she again contacts Malfeitor (still believing to be David) about the accident, and the spirit lies that he did not cause it. Soon, Linda begins to fall under progressive entrapment, in which the spirit changes and starts to terrorize the user, rendering the person weak and easy to possess. Brandon brings over a psychic medium named Sarah \\"Zarabeth\\" Crawford to contact David, and if necessary to exorcise him from the building. The spirit puts up little resistance and leaves, but after leaving, Zarabeth is suspicious and wants to research the occurrence. Not long after getting home, she is attacked and killed by Malfeitor; her throat is slashed before being thrown out of a window and impaled onto a spike. The next morning, Brandon is shocked to hear about Zarabeth's death on the newscast, and immediately suspects the spirit David murdered her. After Brandon leaves for more information, Linda is unconscious by Malfeitor and she is sent to a hospital after Jim contacts an ambulance. During this time, Brandon and Jim conduct research on David, and later initially accuse the spirit of terrorizing Linda.... A:","output":"When the camera zooms in on the ouija board in the movie Witchboard, it shows the planchette moving over the various letters, spelling out messages that the characters believe are coming from the spirit of a deceased ten-year-old boy named David. However, it is later revealed that the spirit is actually that of a malevolent ghost named Carlos Malfeitor who initially tricks them by pretending to be David. As the camera focuses on the ouija board during various points in the movie, the text spelled out by the planchette changes in accordance to the plot progression and the interactions between the spirit, Linda, Jim, and Brandon. At different times, the camera might show the ouija board spelling out messages that seem innocuous or even helpful, such as when the spirit tells Linda where to find her lost diamond engagement ring. At other points in the film, the messages might be more sinister or foreboding, reflecting the true nature of Carlos Malfeitor and his intent to cause harm and chaos. Throughout the movie, the ouija board serves as a focal point for the characters' interactions with the spirit world, a portal through which they unwittingly unleash a dangerous and malevolent force. Each time the camera zooms in on the board, it provides the audience with a visual cue as to what information or communication is taking place between the characters and the spirit masquerading as David. The specific messages on the ouija board vary throughout the movie, but they consistently create an atmosphere of suspense and reveal how the characters are being manipulated by the spirit of Carlos Malfeitor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The treatment from the doctor didn't involve medication and used therapy instead because the","output":"patient was suffering from a condition that required a more holistic and comprehensive approach to healing, which was better facilitated through therapeutic modalities rather than pharmacological interventions. In this particular case, the patient was suffering from a psychosomatic illness, meaning that their physical symptoms were a result of mental or emotional factors instead of a specific physiological issue. Traditional medication, although often useful in addressing some physical symptoms, does not necessarily address the psychological components that trigger the manifestation of those symptoms. Thus, the doctor opted to use therapy as an alternative treatment. Therapeutic interventions vary but often encompass psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and forms of stress management. The therapies' goals are to help the patient identify the underlying psychological triggers for their physical symptoms and assist them in managing and coping with those triggers more effectively. By using therapy as a primary form of treatment, the doctor can foster a deep, transformative healing process in the patient, addressing not only the symptoms but also the root causes of their psychosomatic condition. This, in turn, can lead to a more sustainable and long-lasting improvement in the patient's overall well-being. In addition to the more traditional forms of therapy, the doctor might also recommend complementary treatments to support the individual's healing process. These treatments may include physical therapies, such as yoga, massage, or chiropractic care, as well as various alternative and integrative healing modalities such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, or nutritional counseling. By employing these complementary therapies, the doctor hopes to create a multidimensional and integrative treatment plan that addresses the patient's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health needs. Furthermore, the doctor's decision to forgo medication and focus on therapy could be due to various reasons, including potential medication side effects, drug interactions, or patient history of substance abuse. In some individuals, medication might not be appropriate or might exacerbate existing conditions. By utilizing a therapeutic approach, the doctor can offer a safe and effective alternative tailored to the individual's specific requirements. Overall, the doctor's choice to utilize therapy instead of medication in this instance demonstrates their commitment to addressing the patient's unique needs and offering a comprehensive, holistic approach to healing. By prioritizing the individual's mental and emotional well-being, the doctor hopes to foster long-lasting and meaningful change, ultimately aiding the patient in attaining a greater sense of balance, well-being, and overall quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bork scratched his head,\\" does not directly entail the hypothesis \\"The sky was broken to pieces.\\" The premise primarily refers to two concepts: the mystery of magic working and the unexplained state of the sky. It seems that an understanding of how magic operates in this specific context has been somewhat clarified. However, this understanding does not provide an explanation for the mysterious condition of the sky. Analyzing the hypothesis, \\"The sky was broken to pieces,\\" implies that some catastrophic event or series of events shattered the sky, causing fragmentation and disarray. The hypothesis could be a metaphorical interpretation of the state of the sky or a literal, physical scenario that has occurred. Nonetheless, it suggests a dramatic change in the sky's appearance or structure. Although the premise indirectly raises questions about the sky's condition, it does not confirm nor refute the hypothesis. The understanding of magic working in this context could be related to the hypothesis, but the connection is not explicitly established in the premise. It is plausible that the unexplained state of the sky might have a relationship with the magic working in this situation. However, there is no definitive evidence in the premise to support or negate the idea that the sky was broken into pieces. Thus, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that it entails the hypothesis \\"The sky was broken to pieces.\\" There may be some correlation between the two, but a more detailed investigation or additional context would be needed to determine whether there is a direct relationship between the unexplained sky and its potential fragmentation. It is possible that other factors could contribute to the mysterious state of the sky, leaving the hypothesis open for further exploration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads?  Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863. Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.The series' impact on Dalí is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande hazaña! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande hazaña! Con muertos!. In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads.

Yes To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's first break down both sentences and analyze their meanings and implications. Sentence 1: \\"Which brings us back to where we Human nature--or, at least, human nature as it has evolved in our American times.\\" This sentence discusses the topic of human nature and specifies its context as \\"human nature as it has evolved in our American times.\\" While the wording might be unusual, we can understand that the sentence is referring to the evolution of human nature within the particular socio-cultural context of America. Sentence 2: \\"Human nature has evolved in our American times.\\" Here, the sentence is simply saying that human nature has evolved during the period referred to as \\"our American times.\\" This sentence conveys the idea that human nature has adapted or changed over the course of American history. Now, by comparing the two sentences, we can observe that both of them are discussing the evolution of human nature in the context of American history. If Sentence 1 is true, it implies that human nature has been evolving within the American sociocultural landscape. This evolution is further elaborated upon in Sentence 2, which provides a simpler and more direct statement about the same idea. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence must also be true, since both sentences convey the same core idea – that human nature has evolved during \\"our American times.\\" In this case, the correct answer to the multi-choice question is \\"1).

Write a title for this article: Adam Carolla’s career changed for the better when he left behind morning radio to join Dr. Drew Pinsky on “Loveline” in 1995. That relationship lasted for 10 years, as Carolla and Dr. Drew dispensed advice on the radio — and eventually on MTV — to the confused and unlucky. After Carolla left the show in 2005, he built his own cottage industry, including books, his Mangria wine label, and a new movie, “Road Hard,” that he recently crowd-funded. At the center of Carolla’s enterprise is Carolla Digital, a podcast network that includes shows hosted by Larry Miller and Penn Jillette, in addition to four that Carolla does himself. One of those is “The Adam & Dr. Drew Show,” which reunites Carolla with his old “Loveline” partner. Carolla and Dr. Drew bring their tour to the Wilbur Theatre Saturday, sandwiched by weekend appearances in New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Q. What can people expect in terms of the format of the reunion show? A. It’ll be some philosophy and some jokes and some discussion and some debate. At some point, we’ll turn it over to the audience and do some Q&A. Q. How is the show different now from when you two started? A. I’m a father now and have some gray on my temples and probably am a little more mature than I was back in the day. But philosophically, not wildly different. We’re not playing colleges anymore, so it’s a little less raucous. But it’s more sort of thoughtful than it was, probably, back in the day, and the questions have matured as the audience has matured. Q. What do each of you bring to the partnership? A. I bring guts, glory, humor. Patriotism. Humanity. Philanthropic propulsion. And Drew’s basically a glorified mike stand, to be honest with you. I yell at him after the shows all the time. I can’t believe we’re splitting this money 50/50 when I do 82 percent of the talking out there. What a deal. You know, he’s obviously the physician, and I’m a carpenter. So we come from completely different backgrounds. But he’s a great listener, and he’s very interested in the human condition. I mean, physiologically, emotionally, spiritually. And I am too, except for I just find the comedy in that. Q. What made you take it on the road? A. This business, I think a lot of people, they BS a lot. They say, “What made you decide to write this book?” “Well, I felt there was a void out there.” No. Somebody paid me. So it’s not like there’s a void and Drew and I need to fill that void, and this audience needs to hear what we have to say. It’s more like, “Hey, you know Drew?” “Yeah.” “You like Drew?” “Yeah.” “You like standing onstage with Drew and making jokes and having fun?” “Yeah.” “How ’bout we line up three shows in the Boston area?” “Yeah, all right.” That’s basically how it goes. And that’s how it goes for everybody. Except I don’t think they admit that. That being said, no book, no live show, no standup — I never phone them in. I’m there sweating through my shirt. I never want somebody to read my book or leave one of my live shows and go, “Well, that was a waste of time.” And that’s kind of what I’ve built my audience on. Q. How many podcasts are you currently participating in, and how do you keep them all going? A. I do five a week of “The Adam Carolla Show.” So five of mine, then I do two or three with Dr. Drew. And then I do one “Carcast,” and one “Ace On the House” — one car show and one home improvement show. So I guess the answer would be nine or 10 a week. And then other people’s podcasts. Q. Do you ever get hoarse doing these? A. I should get tired and I should run out of things to say, but I don’t. I’ve never looked at talking as work. Writing is work. Q. The books, the podcast, the live shows, and now the wine business — is there one thing you consider the flagpole of the operation? A. The podcasts are kind of the main thing. And I’m doing a crowd-fund thing for my next independent film. If you’re a Bryan Cranston fan or a “Breaking Bad” fan you can check out a couple of funny videos I did with him on that. Q. I was going to ask if he was going to be in the movie or not. A. Everybody’s asking me that, and the answer is I really don’t know. Might be able to get him to do a cameo. Q. What is the theme of the film? A. It’s called “Road Hard,” and it’s just about comedians that had a lot of success, were out on the road, moved to Hollywood, got a lot of deals, sitcom deals, film vehicles and all that. And now they’re older, divorced, a little fatter, balder, all the deals have dried up, and they’re forced to go back on the road and play those clubs they left so many years ago. Q. You also launched your “Week in Rage” blog a few months ago. Is there enough that you’re angry about to fill that every week? A. There’s usually enough complaining to go around in a seven-day week for me.

Write a summary based on this article: More than forty years after the first initiatives were taken to ban the use of PCBs, the chemical pollutants remain a deadly threat to animals at the top of the food chain. A new study, just published in the journal Science, shows that the current concentrations of PCBs can lead to the disappearance of half of the world's populations of killer whales from the most heavily contaminated areas within a period of just 30-50 years.      Killer whales (Orcinus orca) form the last link in a long food chain and are among the mammals with the highest level of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in their tissue. Researchers have measured values as high as 1300 milligrams per kilo in the fatty tissue (blubber) of killer whales. For comparison, a large number of studies show that animals with PCB levels as low as 50 milligrams per kilo of tissue may show signs of infertility and severe impacts on the immune system.      Together with colleagues from a wide range of international universities and research institutions, researchers from Aarhus University have documented that the number of killer whales is rapidly declining in 10 out of the 19 killer whale populations investigated and that the species may disappear entirely from several areas within a few decades.      Killer whales are particularly threatened in heavily contaminated areas like the waters near Brazil, the Strait of Gibraltar and around the UK. Around the British Isles, the researchers estimate that the remaining population counts less than 10 killer whales. Also along the east coast of Greenland, killer whales are effected due to the high consumption of sea mammals like seals.      PCBs accumulate in the food chain      The killer whale is one of the most widespread mammals on Earth and is found in all of the world's oceans from pole to pole. But today, only the populations living in the least polluted areas possess a large number of individuals.      Overfishing and man-made noise may also affect the health of the animals, but PCBs particularly can have a dramatic effect on the reproduction and immune system of the killer whales.      Killer whales whose diet includes, among other items, seals and large fish such as tuna and sharks critical accumulate PCBs and other pollutants stored at successive levels of the food chain. It is these populations of killer whales that have the highest PCB concentrations and it is these populations that are at the highest risk of population collapse. Killer whales that primarily feed on small-sized fish such as herring and mackerel have a significantly lower content of PCBs and are thus at lower risk of effects.      PCBs have been used around the world since the 1930s. More than one million tonnes of PCBs were produced and used in, among other things, electrical components and plastics. Together with DDT and other organic pesticides -- PCBs have spread around the global oceans.      Through the 1970s and 1980s, PCBs were banned in several countries and in 2004, through the Stockholm Convention, more than 90 countries have committed themselves to phase out and dispose of the large stocks of PCBs.      PCBs are only slowly decomposed in the environment. Moreover, PCBs are passed down from the mother orca to its offspring through the mother's fat-rich milk. This means that the hazardous substances remain in the bodies of the animals, instead of being released into the environment where they eventually deposit or degrade.      Global investigation of killer whales      \\"We know that PCBs deform the reproductive organs of animals such as polar bears. It was therefore only natural to examine the impact of PCBs on the scarce populations of killer whales around the world,\\" says Professor Rune Dietz from the Department of Bioscience and Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, who initiated the killer whale studies and is co-author of the article.      The research group, which includes participants from the United States, Canada, England, Greenland, Iceland and Denmark, reviewed all the existing literature and compared all data with their own most recent results. This provided information about PCB levels in more than 350 individual killer whales around the globe -- the largest number of killer whales ever studied.      Applying models, the researchers then predicted the effects of PCBs on the number of offspring as well as on the immune system and mortality of the killer whale over a period of 100 years.      More than 50% of the populations under threat      \\"The findings are surprising. We see that over half of the studied killer whales populations around the globe are severely affected by PCBs\\" says postdoc Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, who led the investigations.      The effects result in fewer and fewer animals over time in these populations. The situation is worst in the oceans around Brazil, the Strait of Gibraltar, the northeast Pacific and around the UK. Here, the models show that the populations have virtually been halved during the half century where PCBs have been present.      \\"In these areas, we rarely observe newborn killer whales,\\" says Ailsa Hall, who together with Bernie McConnell developed the models used by Sea Mammal Research Unit in Scotland.      \\"As the effects have been recognized for more than 50 years, it is frightening to see that the models predict a high risk of population collapse in these areas within a period of 30-40 years,\\" says Jean-Pierre Desforges.      A female killer whale may live for 60-70 years, and although the world took its first steps to phase out PCBs more than 40 years ago, killer whales still have high levels of PCBs in their bodies.      \\"This suggests that the efforts have not been effective enough to avoid the accumulation of PCBs in high trophic level species that live as long as the killer whale does. There is therefore an urgent need for further initiatives than those under the Stockholm Convention,\\" concludes Paul D. Jepson, Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, England, who is another killer whale expert and co-author of the article.      In the oceans around the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Alaska and the Antarctic, the prospects are not so gloomy. Here, killer whale populations grow and the models predict that they will continue to do so throughout the next century. ||||| Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science.

Although the poisonous chemicals, PCBs, have been banned for decades, they are still leaking into the seas. They become concentrated up the food chain; as a result, killer whales, the top predators, are the most contaminated animals on the planet. Worse, their fat-rich milk passes on very high doses to their newborn calves.      PCB concentrations found in killer whales can be 100 times safe levels and severely damage reproductive organs, cause cancer and damage the immune system. The new research analysed the prospects for killer whale populations over the next century and found those offshore from industrialised nations could vanish as soon as 30-50 years.      Among those most at risk are the UK’s last pod, where a recent death revealed one of the highest PCB levels ever recorded. Others off Gibraltar, Japan and Brazil and in the north-east Pacific are also in great danger. Killer whales are one of the most widespread mammals on earth but have already been lost in the North Sea, around Spain and many other places.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Killer whales hunting seals off the coast of northern Norway. Photograph: Audun Rikardsen/Science      “It is like a killer whale apocalypse,” said Paul Jepson at the Zoological Society of London, part of the international research team behind the new study. “Even in a pristine condition they are very slow to reproduce.” Healthy killer whales take 20 years to reach peak sexual maturity and 18 months to gestate a calf.      PCBs were used around the world since the 1930s in electrical components, plastics and paints but their toxicity has been known for 50 years. They were banned by nations in the 1970s and 1980s but 80% of the 1m tonnes produced have yet to be destroyed and are still leaking into the seas from landfills and other sources.      The international Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into force in 2004 to tackle the issue, but Jepson said the clean-up is way behind schedule. “I think the Stockholm Convention is failing,” he said. “The only area where I am optimistic is the US. They alone produced 50% of all PCBs, but they have been getting PCB levels down consistently for decades. All we have done in Europe is ban them and then hope they go away.”      The researchers said PCBs are just one pollutant found in killer whales, with “a long list of additional known and as yet unmeasured contaminants present”. Further problems for killer whales include the loss of key prey species such as tuna and sharks to overfishing and also growing underwater noise pollution.      The new research, published in the journal Science, examined PCB contamination in 351 killer whales, the largest analysis yet. The scientists then took existing data on how PCBs affect calf survival and immune systems in whales and used this to model how populations will fare in the future. “Populations of Japan, Brazil, Northeast Pacific, Strait of Gibraltar, and the United Kingdom are all tending toward complete collapse,” they concluded.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Underwater close-up of a killer whale off the coast of northern Norway. Photograph: Audun Rikardsen/Science      Lucy Babey, deputy director at conservation group Orca, said: “Our abysmal failures to control chemical pollution ending up in our oceans has caused a killer whale catastrophe on an epic scale. It is essential that requirements to dispose safely of PCBs under the Stockholm Convention are made legally binding at the next meeting in May 2019 to help stop this scandal.” Scientists have previously found “extraordinary” levels of toxic pollution even in the 10km-deep Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean.      Mariana trench live feed: engrossing viewing from deepest place on Earth Read more      “This new study is a global red alert on the state of our oceans,” said Jennifer Lonsdale, chair of the Wildlife and Countryside Link’s whales group. “If the UK government wants its [proposed] Environment Act to be world-leading, it must set ambitious targets on PCB disposal and protect against further chemical pollution of our waters.”      The research shows that killer whale populations in the high north, off Norway, Iceland, Canada and the Faroes, are far less contaminated due to their distance from major PCB sources. ”The only thing that gives me hope about killer whales in the longer term is, yes, we are going to lose populations all over the industrialised areas, but there are populations that are doing reasonably well in the Arctic,” said Jepson.      If a global clean-up, which would take decades, can be achieved, these populations could eventually repopulate empty regions, he said, noting that killer whales are very intelligent, have strong family bonds and hunt in packs. “It is an incredibly adaptive species – they have been able to [live] from the Arctic to the Antarctic and everywhere in between.”      He praised the billion-dollar “superfund” clean-ups in the US, such as in the Hudson River and Puget Sound, where the polluter has paid most of the costs: “The US is going way beyond the Stockholm Convention because they know how toxic PCBs are.” ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pollution threatens future of killer whales      Killer whales are in deep trouble because of persistent chemical pollution in the environment, researchers say.      A new study suggests the long-term viability of more than half of the different orca groups around the globe is now in question.      Some populations, such as those around the UK, the Strait of Gibraltar, off Brazil, Japan and California, are almost certainly doomed.      The assessment is in Science magazine.      The issue is polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.      These chemical compounds were once manufactured in vast quantities, and used in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment and sealants. But they are highly toxic and although banned decades ago have amassed in the environment, leaching into the ocean.      Killer whales, or orcas, are top predators so they absorb all the PCB pollution taken in by the different prey in their food chain - from fish, right up to seals and sharks.      The PCBs stunt the ovaries of female orcas, limiting their ability to produce calves. The chemicals also suppress the immune system.      What is the outlook for orcas?      The new study models the future of the killer whales' reproductive success and survivability against the chemical challenge.      For those populations living in clean waters, it is positive. Orcas in places like the Antarctic and the Arctic should increase their numbers.      But for those living in the most polluted seas, the next 30-50 years will be grim.      The killer whales that live on the west coast of Scotland, for example, are now down to just eight individuals and they have not produced a calf in more than 20 years.      Paul Jepson, from the Zoological Society of London, says this group will \\"disappear in my lifetime\\".      \\"Over 50% of the populations that we've got data for will actually collapse in our model,\\" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme.      \\"PCBs are such highly toxic chemicals, and they persist in the environment. And it's the killer whales that have by a long way the highest exposures now of any species on Earth; certainly any mammalian species.\\"      Image copyright John Bowler/RSPB Scotland Image caption The Scottish orcas have been found to be heavily contaminated      The curse of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs      Image copyright Getty Images      Polychlorinated biphenyls were manufactured from the 1920s      Banned in the US in 1979, the UK in 1981 and the rest of the EU      Europe produced some 300,000 tonnes from 1954 to 1984      The majority has yet to be destroyed or safely stored away      PCBs were popular in coolant fluids in electrical apparatus      They were used in building construction, especially in sealants      Also in cutting fluids for machining, and carbonless copy paper      Today, only North Korea still manufactures polychlorinated biphenyls      Why are the animals so exposed?      Everything in this story works against the killer whales.      Not only do they accumulate contaminants because of their position as top predators, but the toxic effects hit them where they are particularly vulnerable - in their ability to reproduce.      These are animals that take a long time to reach sexual maturity and even then have perhaps one calf every few years. This puts very precise pressure on a population.      In addition, PCBs are soluble in fat - and killer whales are extremely fat-rich animals. A mother's milk will be loaded with PCBs which she will pass on to her offspring during lactation.      Image copyright Audun Rikardsen      How do we tackle the PCB legacy?      Most PCBs have yet to be destroyed or safely stored away.      Some countries have done better than others. In the US, where federal \\"superfunds\\" have been used to clean up the most heavily contaminated sites, PCB levels entering the ocean have come down.      But there needs to be much more urgency in places such as Europe.      \\"Improper disposal of PCB-containing equipment in landfills may lead to leakage and leaching of PCBs into nearby streams, river, estuaries, and ocean,\\" said lead author on the new report, Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, Denmark.      \\"We know that PCBs were used in paints and sealants in old buildings and for outer coating on ships, so if contaminated building materials are improperly disposed of they could also reach the environment, and demolition of buildings may cause PCBs to enter the air.\\"      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Jepson: \\"The killer whale is the most PCB-contaminated species on Earth\\"      Can we help the orcas themselves?      There is very little that can be done to recover the PCBs once they have reached the ocean. And the robustness of the chemicals means they will hang around in the environment for a very long time.      But there are parallel problems we could conceivably fix, said co-author Ailsa Hall from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University, UK.      \\"We should recognise that this is just one of many stresses on the animals,\\" she told BBC News.      \\"There are things such as noise, changes in habitat, changes in the availability of prey - that we do have influence over. And if we do something about these factors, maybe we can reduce the overall burden of stress, and perhaps then our predictions won't be so dire.\\"      Paul Jepson added: \\"I don't think there'll ever be another PCB story.      \\"I think the chemical industries have learnt the lesson - we know that being fat-soluble is a big risk factor, because that allows things to bioaccumulate.      \\"So, nowadays, no chemical with those properties would be allowed. But PCBs are so difficult to get rid of that we'll be dealing with the legacy for a long time.\\"      Follow on Twitter: @BBCAmos and @Vic_Gill ||||| Most people thought the problem of polychlorinated biphenyls — known as PCBs — had been solved. Some countries began banning the toxic chemicals in the 1970s and 1980s, and worldwide production was ended with the 2001 Stockholm Convention.      But a new study based on modeling shows that they’re lingering in the blubber of killer whales — and they may end up wiping out half the world’s population of killer whales in coming decades.      “It certainly is alarming,” said Jean-Pierre Desforges, a post-doctoral researcher at Aarhus University in Denmark and the lead author on the new study published Thursday in the journal Science.      Whales sit at the top of their food chain. Chemicals like PCBs are taken up by plankton at the base of the food chain, then eaten by herring and other small fish, which are themselves eaten by larger fish, and so on. At each step in this chain, PCBs get more and more concentrated. The most at-risk killer whales are those that eat seals and other animals that are themselves fairly high on the food chain and quite contaminated, Dr. Desforges said. ||||| Summary:","output":"Despite being banned several decades ago, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) still threaten the survival of over half of the world's killer whale populations, researchers warn. A new study, published in the journal Science, found that highly toxic PCBs concentrate in killer whales, causing damage to their immune systems and reproductive organs, while also being passed on to offspring through milk. Among the populations most at risk are the UK's last pod of killer whales, some off Gibraltar, Japan and Brazil and in the northeast Pacific. These populations are expected to vanish within 30 to 50 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Movie title: Def by Temptation Context: The story is set in New York and revolves around the relationship between two childhood best friends: \\"Joel\\", who is raised by his religious grandmother after both of his parents are killed in an automobile accident, and \\"K\\" who abandons religion, moves to New York and becomes a movie star. Joel (now a minister like his deceased father), becomes somewhat disillusioned with Christianity and decides to take a trip to New York to visit his friend, K. While awaiting Joel's arrival, K (played by Kadeem Hardison) visits the local bar and meets the perfect woman (played by Cynthia Bond)--who in reality is a succubus seeking blood, and vengeance against any and all men foolish enough to be tempted by her. The audience is first given a taste of the demon's powers when shortly before meeting K, she seduces and then kills an employee of the local bar she uses as her hunting ground. Later, during sexual intercourse with a patron of the bar (a closeted homosexual), she transforms into a beast and kills him, horribly. During another seduction (and after having met K) she infects a married man with an incurable, flesh-eating disease before sending him home to his wife who promptly shoots him. Later, when K attempts to introduce her to Joel (played by James Bond III) he is astonished when she pretends to have never met him and spends the entire evening with Joel. It is then that K meets fellow bar patron \\"Dougy\\" an unsuccessful pickup artist (played by Bill Nunn). The next day when she calls on Joel at K's apartment, K decides to confront her and notices that she casts no reflection in the mirror. A frightened K stands passively by as she and Joel leave on a date. K heads to the bar hoping to find Dougy. After confiding in Dougy the day's events. Dougy reveals himself to be an undercover agent belonging to a special task force investigating a string of strange occurrences, disappearances and murders centered around the bar. Dougy and K pay a visit to a medium--Madame Sonia (played by Melba Moore), who goes into a trance and...","output":"...reveals the succubus' true nature, her intentions, and the danger she poses to Joel and other men who fall victim to her temptations. The medium warns K and Dougy that they must act quickly, as the succubus grows more powerful with each victim she claims. K, feeling guilty for initially succumbing to the succubus' charms and endangering Joel, becomes determined to end the demon's reign of terror. K and Dougy embark on a mission to gather knowledge about succubi and ways to defeat them. They consult ancient texts, consult with religious scholars, and delve deep into the occult to uncover the key to vanquishing the succubus. Meanwhile, Joel, unaware of the danger he is in, starts falling for the succubus' allure. As their relationship deepens, Joel's faith in Christianity starts to waver. He questions the nature of good and evil and wonders whether the strict moral code of his faith is compatible with his desires. Over time, K and Dougy discover that to defeat the succubus, they must rely on their respective strengths: K's deep-rooted faith in Christianity that he had abandoned, and Dougy's knowledge and experience in dealing with supernatural threats. Armed with newfound wisdom and determination, they form a plan to confront the demonic entity and save Joel from imminent doom. Before they can execute their plan, the succubus senses that something is amiss and attempts to hasten her plans for Joel. She tries to completely sever his ties to Christianity, pushing him to the brink of abandoning his faith entirely. Joel, although conflicted, begins to realize that something sinister is going on and decides to confront the succubus himself. A climactic battle ensues between the succubus, Joel, K, and Dougy. Joel, now aware of the demon's intention, is forced to make a choice between surrendering to temptation or embracing the power of his faith. K, on the other hand, must come to terms with his abandonment of religion and rediscover the strength it once provided him. Ultimately, through an intense struggle, the power of friendship, faith, and redemption prevail. Joel and K manage to overcome the succubus by combining their strengths. The succubus, weakened and unable to sustain her hold over her victims, is banished back to the underworld from which she emerged. The damage she caused is undone, and Joel's faith in Christianity is restored. The movie \\"Def by Temptation\\" highlights the importance of faith, friendship, and self-discovery. It serves as a reminder that even when faced with unimaginable evil, one can find the strength needed to prevail, both in themselves and in the support of those around them. In the context of the movie, K is the one who abandons religion, which leads to the events that unfold throughout the story. This abandonment of faith puts both him and his friend, Joel, at risk from the succubus' sinister intentions. Through struggle, danger, and self-reflection, K eventually finds his way back to religion, which plays a pivotal role in defeating the supernatural threat facing them."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a passage, and you need to write an **implausible** answer to to fill in the place of \\"_\\".

West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Francis Jack \\"Frank\\" McEwen, OBE (19 April 1907  15 January 1994) was an English artist, teacher, and museum administrator. He is best remembered today for his efforts to bring attention to the work of Shona artists in Rhodesia, and for helping to found the National Gallery of Zimbabwe. He was awarded the OBE in 1963.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.

It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare.

Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The event you are referring to is the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which was a policy of the United States government in the 19th century whereby Native Americans were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the eastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi River, thereafter known as Indian Territory. The Okchai tribe, which was a part of the Muscogee (Creek) Confederacy in Alabama, was one of the many tribes impacted by this policy. The Muscogee, also known as the Creek Indians, were a large group of tribes that lived primarily in the southeastern United States, encompassing areas that are now present-day Georgia, Alabama, Florida, and South Carolina. The Creek Confederacy was an alliance of Muscogee tribes that banded together for mutual protection and to maintain political and social organization. The Indian Removal Act was pursued under the administration of President Andrew Jackson, who advocated for the removal of Native American tribes from the southeastern United States in an effort to open up new lands for white settlers. The Act aimed at facilitating the relocation of Native Americans from their ancestral territories to lands in the western parts of the country, west of the Mississippi River. The implementation of the Indian Removal Act resulted in several tragic events known today as the Trail of Tears. From 1831 to 1838, thousands of Native Americans from various tribes, including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and Seminole, were forcibly relocated from their ancestral lands. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 Native Americans were removed during this period, resulting in the deaths of thousands due to disease, starvation, exposure, and exhaustion during the forced marches to their new lands, which were often unsuitable for their traditional ways of life. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation, including the Okchai tribe, was one of the tribes most severely impacted by the Indian Removal Act. In 1832, the Treaty of Cusseta was signed between the United States government and the Creek tribe, which ceded all of the Creek lands in Alabama to the United States in exchange for individual allotments of land in the newly established Indian Territory, now known as Oklahoma. The removal of the Creek tribe, including the Okchai, began in 1836 and continued until 1837. During this time, the tribes were subjected to harsh conditions and forced to march hundreds of miles across treacherous terrain without adequate provisions, ultimately leading to the suffering and death of a significant number of tribal members. The forcible removal of the Okchai and other Muscogee tribes from their ancestral homelands marked a dark and painful chapter in American history, with the lasting effects of the Indian Removal Act still being felt by Native American communities today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hakea preissii, commonly known as the Needle tree, Needle bush and Christmas hakea, is a shrub or tree of the genus \\"Hakea\\" native to an area in the Pilbara, Wheatbelt, Mid West and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia. The Noongar name for the plant is Tanjinn. Can we draw the following conclusion? The needle tree (Hakea preissii) known also as Tanjinn, is common to Pilbara.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Needle tree (Hakea preissii), which is also known as Tanjinn, is common to the Pilbara region of Western Australia, among others. The plant's natural distribution encompasses several regions, including but not limited to the Pilbara, Wheatbelt, Mid West, and Goldfields-Esperance areas. Hakea preissii, or the Needle tree, belongs to the Proteaceae family and is native to Western Australia. It usually grows as a shrub or a small tree, presenting a unique and characteristic appearance due its stiff, needle-like leaves. These leaves, which can measure up to 15 centimeters in length and about 1 millimeter in width, have axillary inflorescences, meaning the flowers arise at the intersection between the leaves and stems. The distinct flowers of the Needle tree are white or cream in color and are generally clustered in spherical inflorescences. This attractive floral display occurs between May and September, thus making the plant a particularly appealing addition to native gardens within its natural range. The beautiful flower display is followed by the production of woody seed capsules that measure between 2.5 and 3.5 centimeters long. In addition to being admired for its visual appeal, Hakea preissii possesses ecological significance, as it provides a vital food source for native bird species such as honeyeaters. Specifically, the flowers' nectar offers sustenance that attracts these birds and helps to facilitate pollination. Furthermore, the Needle tree has cultural importance, as evidenced by its Noongar name, Tanjinn. The Noongar people are Indigenous Australian inhabitants of the southwest corner of Western Australia, and the local name signifies the plant's presence in their cultural history and traditional knowledge. In conclusion, the Needle tree (Hakea preissii), also known as Tanjinn, is indeed common to the Pilbara region of Western Australia, along with the Wheatbelt, Mid West, and Goldfields-Esperance regions. Its unique appearance, ecological role, and cultural significance make it an essential component of the area's biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The book was adapted into a 1990 telefilm , Lantern Hill , by Sullivan Films , the producer of the highly popular Anne of Green Gables television miniseries and the television series Road to Avonlea .  - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one .  - Anne Shirley is a fictional character introduced in the 1908 novel \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Montgomery wrote in her journal that the idea for Anne's story came from relatives who, planning to adopt an orphaned boy, received a girl instead.

Question: suppose more pressure builds over time happens, how will it affect MORE oil.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"A: more When more pressure builds over time, it can lead to the formation of more oil. This is because the increased pressure and heat cause the organic matter within the buried plants and animals to undergo a series of chemical reactions. As a result, these reactions break down the complex organic molecules into simpler hydrocarbon compounds, which then form crude oil and natural gas. Under optimal conditions of pressure and temperature, more crude oil can be generated, as the pressure continues to transform the organic material into oil. However, it's important to note that the process is not infinite, as it will eventually reach a point where the organic material is fully transformed, and no new hydrocarbon deposits can be generated. In conclusion, more pressure building up over time can lead to more oil being produced, as long as there is still organic material to be transformed.

The first sentence uses \\"the government\\" as its subject, while the second one simplifies it to \\"government.\\" This alteration preserves the primary message, indicating that the subject still revolves around the executive branch of government. 2. The use of the definite article \\"the\\" is also slightly different in the two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"the\\" is added before \\"deputy prime ministers.\\" However, it is omitted in the second sentence.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  I am facing a new situation today: Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight?

Please answer the following question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. What did the engineer think about Fergus? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - She liked him - not enough information - She hated him - He's a rule breaker Answer:","output":"She liked him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

TV - FOR BARYSHNIKOV, IT'S A HOLLYWOOD NIGHT - NYTimes.com MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV has used television well in his ascent to superstardom. He has recorded a few ballet programs for public television. He did ''The Nutcracker'' for CBS-TV. His ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' special deservedly won a slew of awards. And now, in the same showcase vein, he is starring at 10 o'clock tonight on CBS in ''Baryshnikov in Hollywood.'' ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' it isn't. The first special combined low-key charm with New York sophistication as it reviewed great stage musicals, from ''Oklahoma!'' to ''A Chorus Line.'' The new production, produced and directed by Don Mischer, focuses on the nutty superficiality of Hollywood. Mr. Baryshnikov and company - including Dom DeLuise, Shirley MacLaine, Bernadette Peters, Charles Nelson Reilly, Gene Wilder and, as the unseen narrator, Orson Welles - are limited largely to tongue-in-cheek romping, all of which is executed marvelously but finally tends to become a wee bit monotonous. The dance star is seen closing a season in New York and preparing for a Caribbean vacation. Enter the maniacal Mr. DeLuise as a producer determined to lure Mr. Baryshnikov to Silver Screen fame. ''Dancers always have trouble with their feet,'' the producer observes, ''actors hardly even have corns.'' In Hollywood, Mr. Baryshnikov is sent to a dialogue coach for his accent, but spends most of his performing time in nonspeaking roles, going from ''The Sheik'' and ''The Pirate'' to a casual but energetic history of old musicals. Dedicated with love and affection to James Cagney, the show is nearly always pleasant and, with choreography by Michael Kidd and Peter Anastos, never less than ebullient. That is one of the problems. When Mr. Baryshnikov takes time out for a quiet moment, recalling in acting class an incident from his childhood, it turns out to be the highlight of the hour. For the much of the rest of the time, he smiles impishly, is charmingly boyish and dances superbly. Doubtless, he will yet become America's sweetheart. With the season's audience-popularity ratings race just about settled - CBS on top, NBC on the bottom -and with another sweeps period, crucial to local stations and their advertising rates, about a week away, the schedule is heavy these days with documentaries, always the least likely candidates to attract massive audiences. One that sticks out from the others, however, is ''People Like Us,'' on CBS tonight at 8 o'clock. There is one overriding reason - the presence of Bill D. Moyers who, virtually alone among network correspondents, is allowed to bring a personal vision and voice to his reports. This time around, Mr. Moyers looks at the country's truly needy, the people who President Reagan said would not be hurt by cutbacks in Federal spending. The correspondent does not bombard the viewer with statistics, charts and man-in-the-street interviews. He simply interviews four very different people: a victim of cerebral palsy cut off the Social Security disability rolls, the mother of three children forced to give up a low-paying job and go back on welfare, a mother reluctantly sending her paralyzed daughter to a hospital because of changes in the Government rules for home health care and a priest overseeing free meals at his church, where the number of hungry guests has doubled in the last year. Mr. Moyers does what he does best - talking directly to the people. He sits with distraught families, he strolls with a gently optimistic youth, he probes the feelings of those forced to take charity. The camerawork of Tom Spain and Rick Thompson captures fleeting expressions that tell more than volumes of statistics. Mr. Moyers is fair to all sides, but he refuses to come down in the middle of the nowhere sometimes called ''balance.'' In his concluding remarks, he says: ''There's no question but that Federal programs which help the poor are riddled with waste and fraud. So are programs that help the middle class. So are subsidies to corporations. So are the billions being spent on the military-industrial complex. But the President and the Congress have chosen not to offend the rich, the powerful and the organized. It is easier to take on the poor. They have been asked to sacrifice because the economy is in trouble and because some people are cheating the system. But for all the fraud and waste, for all their inefficiencies, these programs are a life-support system for the poor. For many, we are pulling the program.'' In the too often anonymous world of television, Mr. Moyers has managed to develop and, more significantly, retain a distinctive presence.

What is the correct answer to this question?","output":"The finger got burned due to a combination of factors involving the properties of metal and the process of heat transfer. To understand this phenomenon, we need to look into the characteristics of metals and the ways in which heat moves from one object to another. Metals, such as the one the spoon is made of, are good conductors of heat. This means that they allow heat to flow through them easily and quickly. This property is mainly due to the molecular structure of metals: they possess a lattice of positive ions surrounded by a \\"sea\\" of freely moving electrons. These electrons can transfer energy throughout the metal at a rapid pace, leading to effective heat conduction. Now, let's consider the process of heat transfer. Heat transfer can occur through three primary mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation. In the case of the metal spoon in the boiling soup, heat transfer takes place through conduction. 1. Conduction: When the metal spoon is placed in the boiling soup, the heat from the soup is transferred to the spoon by direct contact between the soup and the spoon. As the metal is a good conductor, the heat energy is quickly and efficiently transferred throughout the entire spoon, including the handle. 2. Convection: The continuous movement of the soup would also contribute to the flow of heat to the spoon, as the hotter soup particles rise around the spoon and transfer heat to it. The cooler particles move downwards. However, convection does not play a significant role in the transfer of heat to the spoon handle. 3. Radiation: The spoon and the soup would also emit thermal radiation, but this has negligible impact as they both are at similar temperatures. In summary, the primary reason the cook's finger got burned upon touching the metal spoon is that the heat from the boiling soup was efficiently transferred to the spoon through conduction due to its metal construction. The spoon, acting as a good conductor of heat, transferred the heat energy throughout its length, including the handle. When the cook touched the handle of the spoon, their finger was instantly exposed to the intense heat, resulting in a burn. To avoid such burns in the future, one should use heat-resistant utensils with insulating handles or use a protective barrier, such as an oven mitt or a cloth, to pick up the utensil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"Dans chaque capitale, la mission a tenu des réunions avec des dignitaires religieux\\" when translated to English states, \\"In every capital, the mission held meetings with religious dignitaries.\\" The sentence is primarily about a mission, which could refer to various types of missions, such as a diplomatic mission, a religious mission, or an exploratory mission, among others. Each capital city mentioned implies that the mission involved numerous countries or political entities, showcasing its international scope. It is likely that the mission's purpose and objectives demanded cooperation and discussions among various nations or regions in order to accomplish its goals. The meetings held with religious dignitaries in each capital suggest that religious leaders or representatives played a significant role in the mission as well. It may be inferred that the mission sought to gather input from or collaborate with religious authorities to address certain issues or concerns. Such involvement is not uncommon, as religious organizations and their leaders can often have considerable influence on local communities and can contribute valuable perspectives on social, cultural, or ethical matters. Moreover, the inclusion of religious dignitaries in these meetings highlights an effort to integrate religious considerations into the mission's overall approach. This could involve addressing religious sensitivities, aligning the mission's goals with religious values, or fostering dialogue that encompasses a broader range of viewpoints.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pollution in the air happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let us consider the process step-by-step in the context of the perturbation hypothesis, i.e., an increase in the amount of air pollution. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - With more pollution in the air, there will be more harmful particles and gases entering the lungs along with the air. 2. Air enters bronchioles - These harmful particles and gases will also enter the bronchioles, which might lead to inflammation and damage, making it more difficult for oxygen to flow through. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - The alveoli may also become inflamed or damaged due to the increased pollution, potentially limiting the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Since alveoli might have a reduced ability to hold oxygen, the small blood vessels around them would receive less oxygen. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - The absorption of oxygen by small blood vessels could be negatively affected, resulting in a lower amount of oxygen being delivered to the entire body. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Due to the decreased absorption of oxygen, cells throughout the body will receive less oxygen, which may result in various health issues and reduced cellular functions. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - As the body tries to compensate for the lower oxygen levels, there may be an increase in the production of carbon dioxide, which will be transported back to the lungs. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale - The increased production of carbon dioxide might make it more challenging for the lungs to release it efficiently during exhalation. To conclude, the perturbation hypothesis of more pollution in the air would indeed have a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. The presence of pollutants can cause inflammation and damage to the respiratory system, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen and leading to a decrease in the amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream. This could cause both direct and indirect consequences on overall health and cellular functioning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Soldier returns from Afghanistan to learn his beloved dog is gone updated 2:46 AM EDT, Sat July 27, 2013 1st Lt. Brandon Harker says he returned from deployment in Afghanistan to find the friend he'd left his dog, Oakley, with had given away the dog. (CNN) -- A purebred yellow Labrador retriever, Oakley likes to run, swim and get into most everything -- \\"whether it's trouble or not,\\" his owner 1st Lt. Brandon Harker affectionately says. And as much as anything, Oakley enjoys cuddling wherever, with whomever. That's just what Harker wanted to do with him this month, when he got back from a 9-month deployment to Afghanistan. Except Oakley was gone. The friend with whom Harker had left Oakley said he'd gotten rid of the dog. \\"I'd just like to get him back, safe and sound,\\" Harker said Friday night. \\"That's about it.\\" About a year after joining the Army, Harker got the playful lab over Memorial Day weekend in 2011, while he was at Fort Benning in western Georgia. Describing him sweetly as \\"a very big baby,\\" Harker said Oakley loved to snuggle. \\"It doesn't matter who it was, he'd try to crawl up on your lap.\\" Whenever Harker was in the United States, Oakley would go with him. And whenever he deployed, his beloved dog would be left with a friend. That's what happened last year, when the lieutenant left Oakley with someone he described as a \\"good friend\\" before he headed off to Afghanistan. \\"Every time, while I was gone, I asked about him,\\" Harker said, recalling how his friend would insist Oakley was \\"doing good (and) acting like his regular self. \\"I'd ask for a picture every now and then. But I never got any pictures sent to me.\\" Harker learned the truth as he was flying back to Joint Base Lewis-McCord in Washington. \\"What do you mean you got rid of my dog?\\" he told his friend. In the few days since coming back, Harker has been on a mission. He posted a plea to find Oakley on Craigslist, noting that he didn't know if the dog had been sold or given away -- something he'd been told happened in May, though Harker isn't so sure. That online item describes Oakley as being \\"good with kids and other dogs,\\" with darker yellow spots on his face and going down his sides and legs. He is registered to Harker and has a microchip identifying device, and is a few days shy of being 2 years, 4 months old.

Article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Supporters mob Armenian protest leader Nikol Pashinyan after PM resigns      There were scenes of jubilation in the Armenian capital Yerevan after protests forced the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan.      Opposition supporters accused Mr Sargsyan, who was made prime minister last week after serving 10 years as president, of clinging to power.      \\"The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand,\\" Mr Sargsyan said in a statement.      Former prime minister Karen Karapetyan has taken over as acting PM.      President Armen Sarkissian accepted Mr Sargsyan's and the government's resignation.      Mr Sargsyan's announcement came soon after opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was released from detention. Mr Pashinyan had been arrested on Sunday after he called for Mr Sargsyan's resignation during televised talks.      As well as Mr Pashinyan, two other opposition politicians and some 200 demonstrators were held.      Image copyright AFP Image caption Demonstrators rallied again in the capital Yerevan on Monday      In his statement published on his website, Mr Sargsyan said he was \\"addressing all citizens of the Republic of Armenia... for the last time as leader of the country.\\"      \\"Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,\\" he said. \\"The situation has several solutions, but I will not take any of them... I am leaving office of the country's leader, of prime minister.\\"      His spokesman, Hovhannes Nikoghosyan, told the BBC that Mr Sargsyan was behaving responsibly and fulfilling the demands of the street movement which opposed his appointment as prime minister.      \\"I think his resignation is a clear demonstration of a democracy in force. It's not that every demonstration in every corner of the world leads to the resignation of the authorities,\\" Mr Nikoghosyan said.      Image copyright AFP Image caption Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest      Protesters chanted \\"Nikol, Nikol\\" in the streets on Monday, the 11th straight day of protests. They were joined by hundreds of uniformed soldiers, despite warnings from the defence ministry that any soldiers protesting would be harshly punished.      Mr Pashinyan congratulated the people on their \\"victory\\" following the resignation. \\"You have won, proud citizens of the Republic of Armenia. And no-one can seize this victory from you. I congratulate you, victorious people,\\" he wrote on Facebook.      Mr Sargsyan had faced criticism in Armenia over his close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has also moved between roles as president and prime minister to maintain his grip on power.      Mr Putin's spokesman said on Monday that Moscow was closely watching events in Yerevan. \\"We are very attentively observing what is happening in Armenia,\\" Dmitry Peskov told journalists, calling the country \\"extremely important\\" for Russia.      Asked if Russia would intervene, Mr Peskov said the matter was \\"exclusively an internal affair\\" and Russian action would be \\"absolutely inappropriate\\".      At the scene      Rayhan Demytrie in Yerevan      Jubilation filled the Republic Square in Yerevan as people cracked open bottles of champagne, dancing in the fountain, hugging and waving flags.      \\"This is what victory feels like,\\" said Lena, wrapped in the Armenian tricolour. \\"This is a day to live for, this is the day to be here to witness history!\\" said her husband Armen.      When Mr Pashinyan arrived at Republic Square after being released, the people chanted his name and \\"Victory!\\".      Shortly after, news broke that Mr Sargsyan had resigned and it was as if a firework of joy had exploded in the square. Many here say it is a victory for the whole nation, that the people stood up for democracy and won. And it came on the eve of April 24, which Armenians worldwide mark as Remembrance Day for the victims of mass killings of Armenians at the turn of the 20th century in Ottoman Turkey.      The events in Armenia are significant, because they demonstrate that in a post-Soviet country change is possible through a peaceful, organic, grassroots movement. The fact that the Armenian authorities showed restraint and did not use excessive force against the demonstrators is also an achievement.      But it's important to remember that the new acting prime minister is an old ally of Mr Sargsyan. Only the leadership has changed.      Why were there protests?      In 2015, Armenians voted in a referendum to shift the country from a presidential to a parliamentary system, stripping powers from the president and giving them to the prime minister.      The vote was marred by allegations of ballot rigging and claims Mr Sargsyan wanted to simply switch office after his presidency ended.      The ex-president had formally stated he would \\"not aspire\\" to the prime ministerial position, but on Tuesday last week the country's parliament officially confirmed Mr Sargsyan in the post.      Protesters poured into the streets in the days beforehand to try to stop the parliament from passing the measure, and clashed with police. On the day of the confirmation, Mr Pashinyan said the demonstrations constituted a \\"non-violent velvet revolution\\".      Who is Serzh Sargsyan?      Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Sargsyan has been criticised for his close ties to Russia      Mr Sargsyan served two consecutive terms as president of Armenia, starting in 2008 and ending on 9 April this year. His initial election in 2008 prompted deadly clashes between the state and opposition supporters. At least eight people died.      He won a second five-year term in 2013. Several of his opponents dropped out of the race and one candidate was shot in a suspected assassination attempt.      Mr Sargsyan was also accused of failing to address continuing tensions with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as widespread poverty at home. ||||| SERZH SARGSYAN, who ruled Armenia as president from 2008 until this month, was a faithful client of Vladi­mir Putin. In 2013, after meeting with the Russian president, he abruptly dropped negotiations with the European Union and instead joined Moscow-led economic and security organizations. During a visit to Washington a couple of years later, he frankly told us that his small Caucasian country of roughly 3 million people had little choice, since Armenians working in Russia supplied one-fifth of the country’s gross domestic product and Russian companies monopolized its energy supplies. “Armenian cognac can’t really be sold in Paris,” he explained.      Mr. Sargsyan underestimated his own citizens, however, when he attempted to emulate a classic Putin maneuver. Limited by the constitution to two terms as president, he pushed through a constitutional amendment transferring most executive powers to the prime minister, and then — having denied for years that he would do so — had the parliament name him to that post. The result was 11 days of mounting mass demonstrations that, on Monday, prompted Mr. Sargsyan to give up the position. “I was wrong,” he said in a statement.      It’s not clear whether Mr. Sargsyan’s departure will prompt a genuine change in Armenia’s government or its servile stance toward the Kremlin. Thanks to manipulated elections, the ruling party has a commanding majority in parliament, while the leader of last week’s protests, veteran dissident Nikol Pashinyan, controls just nine of 105 seats. The popular revolt nevertheless is a blow to the authoritarian political model promoted by Mr. Putin, which has spread not only to other former Soviet Bloc states in Russia’s orbit but also to Turkey, where ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan is hoping to complete the transition from prime minister to all-powerful president in June.      No doubt Mr. Putin will misunderstand the rebuff. Consumed by cynicism, the Russian ruler and his clique are incapable of accepting that spontaneous political uprisings by outraged publics are possible. They assume that they must be, like Russia’s own interventions in Western democratic elections, the result of state-directed conspiracies. Mr. Putin blamed the CIA and other intelligence agencies for the revolts that overturned pro-Moscow governments in Ukraine and Georgia, and when thousands of Russians protested election fraud and his own shuttle from prime minister to president in 2012, he held Hillary Clinton personally responsible.      In truth, it’s safe to say that the Trump administration had nothing to do with events in Armenia. The only U.S. response to the demonstrations was a weak statement from the embassy in Yerevan asking the government for “restraint” while calling on the protesters to “prevent an escalation of tensions.” What drove Armenians to the streets was not foreign provocations but the fact that Mr. Sargsyan’s bet on Russia failed to deliver. During his decade in office, the economy stagnated. About 10 percent of the population abandoned the country, while 30 percent of those who remained fall below the official poverty line.      Mr. Putin can be expected to squeeze whoever succeeds Mr. Sargsyan as prime minister; in addition to its economic levers, Russia maintains a military base in the country. That, however, won’t improve the lives of Armenians. More likely it will increase their resistance to the thuggish, corruption-ridden and economically failed model that is Putinism. ||||| MOSCOW — Ten days of demonstrations that escalated throughout Armenia forced the resignation Monday of the man who has led the country for the past decade, creating the latest crisis in a post-Soviet state trying to overcome a legacy of weak democratic rule.      The unexpected resignation prompted scenes of jubilation in the capital, Yerevan, and other cities. Tens of thousands of people flocked to the central Republic Square in Yerevan, where all afternoon and into the night they danced, cheered and waved the Armenian flag, a striped tricolor of red, blue and orange.      Serzh Sargsyan, president since 2008, reached his legal two-term limit earlier this month. A constitutional referendum in 2015 had transferred most presidential powers to the role of prime minister, however, and the Parliament, dominated by his right-wing Republican Party, swiftly voted him into the post with no other candidate given a chance.      “I was wrong,” Mr. Sargsyan said in a brief resignation statement carried by the official news agency. “The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand.” |||||Summary:","output":"The Prime Minister of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan, has resigned after 11 days of mass protests against his rule.

Does being rich contribute to your spiritual life and its possibilities? Is the gap between the rich and poor a religious problem as well as a social problem in desperate need of solutions? Jesus, Pope Francis, and brain scientists have asked these questions, and the answers are clear if unnerving. Wealth and power are dangerous for your mental health, your spiritual condition, and for society in general -- especially when they contribute to the neglect of the poor. New research explains how this works (more on this in a minute). Ridding the world of poverty is, of course, a fantasy. Jesus knew this: \\"You will always have the poor among you,\\" he said (Matthew 26:11). He also said, \\"God blesses you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is yours.\\" (Luke 6:20). Only a few verses before this moment in Luke, he cries (echoing the Old Testament): \\"The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring the good news to the poor.\\" (Luke 4:18). Is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to","output":"Jesus seeking advice on how to attain eternal life, he was instructed to sell all his possessions, give the money to the poor, and follow Jesus in a life of simplicity and devotion? (Matthew 19:16-22). It's no secret that Jesus consistently championed the cause of the poor and warned against the corrupting influence of wealth. Even the early Christian church practiced communal living, sharing their resources to ensure that none among them suffered the pangs of poverty (Acts 2:44-45). This focus on the dangers of wealth and the importance of helping the poor is prevalent in many religious traditions, not just Christianity. Buddhism preaches the value of detachment from material possessions, and Islam requires giving of alms to aid the less fortunate as one of its five central pillars. The concern for the impoverished and the call to seek spiritual contentment rather than material wealth demonstrate the deep-rooted belief in a link between excessive wealth and spiritual decline. Contemporary research has begun to uncover more about the psychological impact of wealth and power on individuals and society. Studies have shown that the wealthy tend to exhibit traits such as narcissism and entitlement. Often, they also display a lack of empathy for those less fortunate, attributing their wealth to their own hard work and deservingness, while attributing the plight of the poor to laziness or incompetence. As a result, the wealthy may become detached from the struggles of the less fortunate and desensitized to their needs. This detachment creates a cycle that perpetuates income inequality, as those in power are more likely to support policies that maintain the status quo and further enrich themselves to the detriment of the lower classes. The widening wealth gap has significant societal consequences, including increased crime rates, political instability, and a lower overall happiness index across the population. Thus, the warnings of Jesus, Pope Francis, and brain scientists should not be taken lightly. Of course, not all wealthy individuals succumb to these negative traits, and there are many philanthropists who use their resources for the betterment of society. Nevertheless, it is crucial for those with wealth – and society as a whole – to be aware of the innate dangers and remain vigilant in guarding against the corrupting influence of excessive wealth and power. Addressing the religious and social implications of the wealth gap may not be easy, but the values ingrained in these time-honored teachings provide a roadmap for action. Humility, empathy, and a genuine concern for the well-being of the less fortunate must be given higher priority than the pursuit of wealth and power. Governments, institutions, and individuals must work together to create policies and programs designed to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, thereby fostering a more compassionate and equitable society for all. In conclusion, the teachings of Jesus, the statements of Pope Francis, and the findings of brain scientists should serve as a wake-up call for modern society to reevaluate its priorities and address the wealth gap. By heeding their wisdom and recognizing the spiritual and societal dangers associated with wealth, we can work together to create a world that values empathy, compassion, and the well-being of all people over the accumulation of material possessions. Ultimately, this will not only lead to a more just and harmonious society but may also contribute to individual spiritual growth and fulfillment beyond the temporary thrill of material wealth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this problem: 955 * s + 8802 = 629 * s First, we want to put all the \\"s\\" things on one side and the numbers on the other side. So, let's subtract 629 * s from both sides.

Now our problem looks like this: 326 * s + 8802 = 0 To continue, we want to get \\"s\\" all by itself. So, let's subtract 8802 from both sides: 326 * s = -8802 Now, to find what \\"s\\" is, we simply divide both sides by 326: s = -8802 / 326 After doing the division, we find out that: s = -27 So, the solution to the math problem is s = -27."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Now, I have a new situation: Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits. Jerry ate healthy food, and was always on top of his caloric consumption, while Ben overate because he loved fatty foods such as butter, bacon et al.  Answer this question please: Which friend was at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided and the dietary habits of both friends, Ben was at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. This conclusion is based on several factors related to Ben's dietary choices and preferences. Excess dietary lipids are known to be harmful due to their high caloric content, which can lead to unhealthy weight gain. As Ben preferred fatty foods like butter and bacon, it can be deduced that his diet was high in lipids. Overconsumption of lipids contributes to increased lipid levels in the blood, which can in turn lead to cardiovascular problems. The dietary lipids of most concern for cardiovascular health include saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. Fatty foods such as butter and bacon are known to be high in saturated fats, which are closely linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Additionally, these fatty foods commonly contain considerable amounts of cholesterol, which is the main lipid responsible for narrowing arteries and causing atherosclerosis, a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Jerry maintained a healthy diet, which is associated with numerous health benefits and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Being mindful of his caloric consumption suggests that Jerry likely controlled his intake of lipids, avoiding excessive consumption and promoting better overall health. In conclusion, Ben's preference for fatty foods, such as butter and bacon, and likely higher consumption of lipids, make him at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease when compared to Jerry, who opted for a healthier diet and managed his caloric intake. Maintaining healthy eating habits and controlling lipid consumption is essential for reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems and promoting overall health and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The game was played under horrible weather conditions with heavy lake effect snow falling throughout the game making it difficult for either team to move the ball offensively.  In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Browns kicker Phil Dawson managed to get a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as LS Ryan Neill's snap to Punter Brian Moorman went over Moorman's head, causing him to kick the ball through his endzone for a Cleveland safety.  Later, the Browns increased their lead with Dawson just managing to nail a 49-yard field goal.  Near the end of the game, Buffalo managed to get deep into Cleveland territory.

Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.  Question: suppose it is winter time happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"During the winter season, the overall process of photosynthesis and subsequent sugar and oxygen production will likely face challenges due to the environmental changes and reduced sunlight. The exact effect will depend on the plant species, as some plants are more adaptive to the colder months. Therefore, it is vital to examine each aspect of the photosynthesis process in relation to winter conditions to make a well-informed conclusion.  1. Carbon dioxide: The concentration of carbon dioxide in the air remains fairly constant irrespective of the seasonal changes. There might be less photosynthesis occurring in some plants due to freezing temperatures and reduced sunlight, which could decrease the overall intake of carbon dioxide in certain plant species. This could slightly contribute to less sugar and oxygen being produced. 2. Stomata: The stomata in plants' leaves are responsible for gas exchange in the process of photosynthesis. During winter, cold temperatures can result in additional water loss from plants, causing some plants to limit their gas exchange or close their stomata to conserve water. This may affect the amount of carbon dioxide entering the leaf and could lead to less sugar and oxygen being produced. 3. Water absorption: Water is essential for the photosynthesis process, but the winter months bring about unique challenges. Due to freezing temperatures, the water in the soil may freeze, making it difficult for some plants to absorb enough water through their roots. Consequently, insufficient water supply may hinder the transportation of nutrients and the overall photosynthesis process, resulting in less sugar and oxygen being produced. 4. Sunlight absorption: During winter, the intensity, angle, and duration of sunlight significantly decreases, especially at higher latitudes. Less available sunlight slows down the rate at which chlorophyll (the green chemical that absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis) can catalyze the reaction. In simpler terms, less sunlight during the winter months directly translates to a reduced rate of photosynthesis, leading to the production of less sugar and oxygen. 5. The second effect: The second effect mentioned pertains to water passing through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves. In winter, lower temperatures, potential freezing of soil water, and reduced transpiration from closed stomata due to water conservation efforts in plants can affect the water flow through the stem. Consequently, this would lead to less water, nutrients, and minerals being transported to the leaves, further affecting the overall rate of photosynthesis and resulting in less sugar and oxygen being produced. Based on the analysis of these key aspects of photosynthesis during winter, it can be concluded that there will likely be a significant reduction in the production of sugar and oxygen. However, it is important to note that the degree of reduction may vary depending on plant species' adaptability, location, and specific environmental conditions. In general, though, the winter season will more likely result in less sugar and oxygen being produced by most plants."},{"instruction":"What type of details about valdemar mota  can be gathered from the following bio?

No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\".

Step 1: Identify the time period The question is asking for the Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1956. So I need to focus on the prime ministers serving in the 1950s. Step 2: Recall prime ministers from that time period In the 1950s, two prime ministers served in Britain: Sir Winston Churchill (1951-1955) and Sir Anthony Eden (1955-1957). Step 3: Determine who was serving in 1956 Since the question is asking for the Prime Minister in 1956, I can see that it falls between Sir Anthony Eden's term as he was in office from 1955 to 1957. Step 4: Provide the answer The Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1956 was Sir Anthony Eden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Fact 2: Liquid waste passes through the blood and the urinary system .  Given the two facts above, how does urine leave the body? The answer is:","output":"Urine leaves the body through a comprehensive process that involves various components of the urinary system. Here is a detailed answer: First, let's understand the urinary system: it comprises two kidneys, two ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra. The primary purpose of this system is to eliminate waste from the body. Waste is filtered out from the blood and converted into urine through a complex process of excretion and re-absorption.  Now, let's unfold the journey of urine from its formation to its exit from the body: 1. Filtration - The process begins in the nephrons, tiny functional units of the kidneys. Each kidney contains about a million nephrons. Blood from the renal artery enters the kidneys and is filtered through these nephrons. This filtration happens in the glomerulus, a tiny blood vessel located in the nephron, where waste products, water, salt, and some glucose are filtered out from the blood. Large molecules like proteins and blood cells are too big to pass through the filtration process and hence, remain within the blood vessel. 2. Reabsorption - As this filtered fluid passes through the nephron, most of the water along with vital nutrients and electrolytes like glucose, amino acids, and necessary ions are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. 3. Formation of Urine - After the reabsorption, the remaining waste forms a liquid called urine. This urine consists of wastes like urea (from protein catabolism) and uric acid (from nucleic acid metabolism), excess electrolytes, and water. 4. Transport - The urine then goes down from the nephrons into the renal pelvis - a funnel-shaped structure that exits the kidney. It then travels down the ureters - muscular tubes that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 5. Storage - In the urinary bladder, the urine gets collected until the bladder fills up. 6. Excretion - When there's a need to urinate, the filled bladder contracts, pushing the urine into the urethra. The urethra then expels the urine externally from the body through an outlet – in males, the outlet is the penis, and in females, it is the urethral opening located just above the opening of the vagina. By this process, the body maintains a stable balance of chemicals and water by removing harmful or unnecessary substances via urine. This reflects the involvement of the urinary system and the circulatory system in the production, transportation, storage, and excretion of urine from the body."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Background: The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970, by songwriters/multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of Beatlesque pop, classical arrangements, and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's leader, arranging and producing every album while writing virtually all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members. Context: For the next six years, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO's back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was \\"Surrender\\" which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was \\"Latitude 88 North\\".  On 9 August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released Live - The Early Years in the UK as a DVD compilation that included Fusion - Live in London (1976) along with never before released live performances at Brunel University (1973) and on a German TV show Rockpalast (1974). The US had a slightly edited release on 24 August 2010. The Essential Electric Light Orchestra artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011.  Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of new recordings of ELO's greatest hits by Lynne; along with a new song \\"Point of No Return\\", released to coincide with Lynne's second solo album release Long Wave. These new 2012 albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album Zoom and Lynne's debut solo album Armchair Theatre, originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album, Electric Light Orchestra Live, showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks.  Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, \\"Livin' Thing\\" and \\"Mr Blue Sky\\" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London.

Summarize: Mohammad Javad Zarif said the Saudi move was \\"positive\\" and urged talks and the formation of a new government. Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia has accused Shia-led Iran of backing the Houthis, something Tehran denies. Saudi defence chiefs said the focus would now shift towards finding a political solution to the crisis. But they said military force would still be used when needed. Mr Zarif tweeted: \\"Positive developments in Yemen should be followed by urgent humanitarian assistance, intra-Yemeni dialogue and broad-based govt. Ready to help.\\" Iran's foreign ministry had earlier welcomed the Saudi announcement. \\"Before this, we said the crisis in Yemen had no military solution, and... a halt to killing innocent and defenceless people is absolutely a step forward,\\" a spokeswoman said, according to the semi-official Isna news agency. Yemen has been in chaos since Houthi, or Zaidi Shia, rebels, seized the capital, Sanaa, in January and placed President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi under house arrest. Mr Hadi escaped and fled to the southern port city of Aden in February. He left the country at the end of March when the Houthis, backed by army units supporting former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, reached the outskirts of Aden. The Saudi-led coalition said its operation Decisive Storm had achieved its goals, \\"removing the threat to Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries\\". Coalition spokesman Brig-Gen Ahmed al-Asiri said a new phase called Restoring Hope was beginning with the aim of stopping Houthi rebels from \\"targeting civilians or changing realities on the ground\\". He said Decisive Storm had ended at the request of the \\"legitimate\\" Yemeni government. In a televised speech, Mr Hadi thanked his Saudi allies for supporting him as Yemeni president. \\"I express the deepest gratitude and respect to our Arab and Muslim brothers and friends in this exceptional strategic alliance in my name and on behalf of the Yemeni people,\\" he said. The US also welcomed the Saudi decision to end air strikes and urged talks to end the crisis. \\"We continue to support the resumption of a UN-facilitated political process and the facilitation of humanitarian assistance,\\" National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said. The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, says that although the Saudis have claimed victory in the first stage of their campaign, the Yemeni government has not been restored and the Houthi militia still controls the capital. The US has been increasingly concerned about the costs of the bombing campaign, he adds, especially the number of civilians being killed. The World Health Organization says that 944 people were reported killed and 3,487 wounded in the four weeks up to Friday. The US has also sent two warships - the USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Normandy - to the region. The Pentagon said the ships were to ensure freedom of navigation but were also watching a flotilla of Iranian cargo vessels that had approached Yemen. On Tuesday, US President Barack Obama warned Iran not to send weapons to Yemen. \\"What we've said to them is that, If there are weapons delivered to factions within Yemen that could threaten navigation, that's a problem,\\" he said. \\"And we're not sending them obscure messages. We send them very direct messages about it.\\" The UN Security Council has imposed an arms embargo on the rebels. Summary:","output":"Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the Saudi move to end airstrikes in Yemen was \\"positive\\" and urged talks and the formation of a new government. Iranian officials have previously stated that the crisis in Yemen has no military solution and that ending the killing of innocent people is a step forward. So far, the Saudi-led coalition has not managed to restore the Yemeni government and the Houthi militia still controls the capital. Iran denies accusations made by Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia of backing the Shia-led Houthis in Yemen. The US has welcomed the Saudi decision to end air strikes, expressed concern over the costs of the bombing campaign, and urged for talks to resolve the crisis. UN-facilitated political processes and humanitarian assistance continue to be supported. President Obama has warned Iran not to send weapons to Yemen, as it would pose a threat to navigation and escalate the situation. The UN Security Council has imposed an arms embargo on the rebels in an effort to regulate the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This statement reflects several positive facets. Initially, mentioning \\"frank humanity\\" implies an honest and open revelation or exploration of human conditions, emotions, or experiences. This frankness or openness typically signifies a sense of acceptance or realization, which is generally connected with personal growth, development, and enlightenment. These are predominantly positive concepts. Just as important is the term \\"emotional recovery,\\" which very much encourages a positive sentiment. Recovery signifies a process of overcoming or moving beyond a certain negative state or condition. It may involve enduring, resilience, and eventual triumph over adversity. In the context of emotions, it could mean recuperating from emotional trauma, sadness, depression, etc., which is indeed a positive shift. Emotional recovery would usually involve feelings of relief, accomplishment, rejuvenation and a sense of returning to a state of emotional health and wellbeing. Even though it does hint that there might have been a period of suffering or hardship initially (as the need for recovery occurs after a problematic phase), the dominance of the healing and rejuvenation process leading to some form of better condition or state implies an overall positive sentiment.  So, in general terms, this statement gives an impression of hope, strength, self-improvement, resilience, honesty, and positivity associated with human conditions, making the sentiment of this sentence predominantly positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[II] Jessica the elixir to grow up fast to grant their fondest wish..","output":"Of the two options, it seemed that the right choice was option II, as the sorcerer Daniel chose to give Jessica the elixir to grow up fast in order to grant their fondest wish. He believed that, by enabling the younger sister to rapidly mature, the siblings would then be on a more equal footing and better able to pursue their shared dream of conquering the magical realm they had discovered mere months ago. Daniel, a wise and experienced sorcerer, knew that in order to conquer the magical realm, the sisters required harmony between them and a shared understanding of both worldly and mystical knowledge. Providing Jessica with the elixir was just the first step to ensuring that they could make an impact in this unfamiliar world. As Jessica drank the potion, she was immediately infused with a magical energy that coursed through her veins, transforming her into a much more mature version of herself. Daniel watched closely as the change took place, making certain that the elixir didn't have any unforeseen side effects. To his surprise and relief, the transformation was seamless, and Jessica soon stood as a grown woman, nearly the same age as Monica. With the sisters now appearing as equals, they embarked upon the journey that lay ahead. Daniel, as their mentor, helped them acquire the knowledge and skills they would need to flourish in this new magical realm. Each day, they delved deeper into the world of sorcery, learning about the delicate balance between light and dark magic, the history of the realm, and the true meaning of power. Working together, Monica and Jessica soon found that their connection was stronger now that they were both adults. The challenges they faced no longer seemed insurmountable, and they tackled each obstacle with courage and conviction. As the sisters honed their magical skills, their love and respect for one another blossomed, inspiring them to strive for greatness in their quest for conquest. However, embracing their newfound abilities also served as a catalyst for unexpected discoveries. The sisters came to understand that the realm they sought to conquer had its own ancient history, filled with secrets and consequences that could change the course of their lives forever. Unbeknownst to them, the lessons they received from Daniel had led them into a world of complex moral dilemmas and fierce adversaries who were not so easily defeated. Despite these newfound challenges, Monica and Jessica remained unyielding, their strong bond propelling them forward on their journey of self-discovery and magical enlightenment. Daniel spotted the greatness within them and could sense that the world had not yet seen the true potential of the sisters' power. The elixir that he had given to Jessica had not only transformed her physically but had also ignited within both sisters an unstoppable force that would forever shape the course of the magical realm's history. As time went on, Monica and Jessica continued to excel at their magical endeavors, while their mentor, Sorcerer Daniel, guided them along their path. They would face triumphs and failures, adversaries and allies, all in the pursuit of their fondest wish. It was through this incredible journey that the sisters would ultimately discover the true meaning of power, friendship, and sacrifice, forever changing not just their lives but the very fabric of the magical realm in which they sought to conquer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The key to halting climate change: admit we can't save everything Climate change, and human resistance to making the changes needed to halt it, both continue apace: 2015 was the hottest year in recorded history, we may be on the brink of a major species extinction event in the ocean, and yet political will is woefully lacking to tackle this solvable problem. Related: Why don't we treat climate change with the rigor we give to terror attacks? | Ruth Greenspan Bell Given these dire ecological trends, limited public funding and legislative gridlock, the time is ripe for a budget-neutral, executive-branch approach for managing our natural resources: triage. A science-based triage approach should be used to classify areas and species into one of three categories: not at immediate risk, in need of immediate attention or beyond help. Refusing to apply triage implicitly assumes that we can save everything and prevent change, which we cannot. Prioritization will occur regardless, just ad hoc and shrouded. This triage system would replace the status quo of inadequately managing our full portfolio of over 1m square miles of public land and 1,589 threatened and endangered species. For areas or species not at immediate risk, we can delay action while monitoring to detect changes in that status. For example, increased temperatures and prolonged periods of drought may increase both wildfires and populations of tree-killing beetles in forests of the Pacific north-west. Knowing this, we can track these variables and explore management options that minimize risk without prematurely devoting disproportionate resources. For areas needing immediate help, we must act now. For the coral reefs of the Florida Keys and US Virgin Islands, all anthropogenic impacts (such as overfishing, pollution and coastal development) must be dramatically reduced. Otherwise, because the health of these coral reefs is currently so compromised, they are unlikely to survive the sea level rise, rising ocean temperatures and increasing acidification resulting from climate change. For species protections, it would be wise to focus on keystone species such as oysters (water filterers), parrotfish (algae eaters on overgrown coral reefs), bees (pollinators) and wolves (key predators). For areas we can no longer maintain, we must make the most difficult of choices – give up, and accept that change is not always preventable. In Alaska, it may be too late to prevent the climate change-induced shift from coniferous-dominated to deciduous-dominated stands, with unfortunate impacts on forest-dwelling species and the logging industry. In the ocean, entire fisheries can be lost from an area when species shift due to warming waters. This is not to say we should de-list endangered species or revoke area protections. Rather, management should account for shifts in climate and habitats and aim to maintain the services ecosystems provide (like pollination, soil fertility, air and water purification and recreation), but acknowledge it may be costly and futile to attempt to maintain a particular ecosystem configuration or species in a particular location. However, even degraded coral reefs can supply key ecosystem services such as fisheries and storm protection. A river can continue to be a source of clean, fresh drinking water and provide habitat for a diversity of species even if it is no longer suitable for trout or salmon. Related: The high court halted Obama's climate change plan. This doesn't bode well | Scott Lemieux For triage to be successful, categorization must be transparent, based on the best available science, and it must avoid politicization and subjectivity. This approach would require us to weigh the many benefits ecosystems provide against the cost effectiveness of various management options. Given the distribution of management authority and the value of local ecological knowledge, these discussions and decisions would need to be just as robust at the local and state levels as at the national level. Employing triage would enable us to holistically consider our natural resources, design strategic management, focus our energies and resources and save as much of our environment as possible for the benefit of this and future generations.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County.

The cabinet was emptier, leaving him to ponder how he could rearrange his belongings in order to fill the newly vacant space and keep the room organized. After a moment of contemplation, he realized that moving the stacks of books and old DVDs into the cabinet would not only free up space on other shelves but also protect them from dust and light damage. Furthermore, he was struck by the notion that his game accessories, such as controllers, could also be neatly stowed away in the cabinet, so they would be close to the console yet out of sight when not in use. With a newfound sense of excitement, he began the process of decluttering and transferring the items to their new respective locations. The books and DVDs fit seamlessly into the cabinet, and it was evident that he had made the right choice in repurposing the empty space. A feeling of satisfaction washed over him as he appreciated the more organized aesthetic of the room. Next, he moved onto the game accessories, wrapping the cords neatly and placing the controllers next to the organized bundles. As he did so, he made the decision to donate some of his older games and accessories that no longer held appeal, further reducing clutter and opening up even more space in the cabinet. After the rearrangement process, he stepped back to survey his work, admiring the efficiency of the new layout and its impact on the room's cohesion. He couldn't help but smile at the thought of inviting friends over soon for a gaming session - the space now felt welcoming and purposeful, all thanks to that once-emptier cabinet. In conclusion, while the initial challenge of fitting his gaming console in the cabinet might have been a source of frustration, it ultimately served as a catalyst for positive change in the room's organization and function. It was a lesson that sometimes a small issue can lead to a larger transformation that not only enhances the space but also brings a sense of accomplishment and pride in one's surroundings.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Basil Sydney  for the following movie plot:  In the early years of the Second World War, aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking Germany's dams in the hope of crippling German heavy industry. Working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, as well as doing his own job at Vickers, he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets. When it came into contact with the dam, it would sink before exploding, making it much more destructive. Wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low (150 feet (46Â m)) to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly, but when he takes his conclusions to the Ministry, he is told that lack of production capacity means they cannot go ahead with his proposals. Angry and frustrated, Wallis secures an interview with Sir Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris (played by Basil Sydney), the head of RAF Bomber Command, who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously. Eventually, however, he is convinced and takes the idea to the Prime Minister, who authorises the project. Bomber Command forms a special squadron of Lancaster bombers, 617 Squadron, to be commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, and tasked to fly the mission. He recruits experienced crews, especially those with low-altitude flight experience. While they train for the mission, Wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems, such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water. This requires the drop altitude to be reduced to 60 feet (18Â m). With only a few weeks to go, he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead. The bombers attack the dams. Eight Lancasters and their crews are lost, but the overall mission succeeds and two dams are breached.

A schoolboy who stunned his family with his bravery after he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour, has died this morning. David Langton-Gilks, 16, who battled the disease for five years, had thought he had beaten the tumour in May this year. When he was told he had relapsed and would die in a matter of weeks, he stunned his relations by saying: 'You can’t win them all.' David slipped into a coma last Saturday and died at 6.10am today - six weeks after. doctors expected him to pass away. 'He died surrounded by love at home,' his mother Sacha, who is a singing teacher, said. Special evening: David was thrilled with the black limousine that arrived to take him to his school prom. David Langton-Gilks, earlier this year with the family dog Honey. She also revealed on. Twitter she found her son's will a few days before he died. He wanted. his things to be shared between his siblings, Rufus and Holly, with his. collection of jellybeans to go to his younger sister. His ukulele was to. go to a family friend. David was told at the beginning of June his condition was terminal and decided that he didn't want further chemotherapy. However, he was desperate to make his. school prom on June 28. His mother Sacha, 44, was able to tell friends. and supporters on Twitter that he fulfilled his ambition. 'DD's DONE it! Grinning in black tie by pristine black limo on our dirty, bumpy farm track,' she posted that evening. The limo was provided by the charity. Rays of Sunshine and marked the start of a very special night, during. which David won the award for 'Most Optimistic Person.' Mrs Langton-Gilk's Twitter updates also revealed David's wish to be cremated and have his ashes scattered at a local watering hole. She also paid tribute to his extraordinary philosophical attitude to life. The day after his prom he told her: 'It's funny how u (sic) realise the significance of your life just when you're about to lose it.' Later that day he said to his parents, Sacha, 44 and Toby, 46: 'I just want to say that I have very much enjoyed myself here; thank you very much.' David, pictured surfing in Cornwall. The trip was paid for by the charity Round Table Children's Wish Limited. The teenager, from Fontmell Magna, in. Dorset, had stopped going to school in May due to concentration problems. caused by the tumour and said his only regret was not being able to do. his Biology A level. His memory worsened as time went on which meant he had to replace reading and playing the guitar with simpler tasks such as cooking. But he still shared precious. exchanges with his family. His mother said his little sister would insist David play. with her saying: 'You can rest when you're dead.' David's mother, Sacha Langton-Gilks. She said David had shown her how to cope by being so strong. Then on 6 August, she recounted. another bittersweet conversation: 'DD 2 me: \\"Do I know u?\\" Me: \\"Yes, very well.\\" DD:. \\"You look very like my mother.\\" Me: \\"Yes I certainly do. She's. marvellous!\\"' The family were helped by Marie Curie nurses who provided much-needed nighttime relief and other support. They were also boosted by how well Team GB did at the Olympics, providing a much-needed distraction. Mrs Langton-Gilks and her family are backing the Headsmart awareness campaign run by The Brain Tumour Charity, to highlight the importance. of detecting brain tumours in children at an early stage. Although David displayed the symptoms. of the disease when he was 11, they were not simultaneous and it took. five-and-a-half weeks to get a diagnosis. Had. it been detected sooner, the tumour would have been around half the. size it was and David would have stood a much better chance of survival. The symptoms of the Medulloblastoma brain tumour include vomiting, headaches, and unusual eye movements. Children have the same risk of developing a brain tumour as meningitis. David's parents released a statement today that said: 'The Langton-Gilks family are determined that everyone knows how to spot the signs of a brain tumour in a child/young person. 'Supporting the HeadSmart Campaign is the fastest way to achieve this. This will save the lives of some of the two coachloads of children who die horribly every year from a brain tumour and massively improve the quality of life for those children, like David, who have to endure years of complex treatment.' They added: 'The family will never be able to express fully their gratitude & admiration to all of the doctors, nurses & support staff at Southampton General Hospital, Salisbury District Hospital & Shaftesbury Abbeyview Medical Centre as well as the following charities: CLICSargent, Marie Curie, the Teenage Cancer Trust and The Brain Tumour Charity who started HeadSmart.'

A:","output":"Season 4 of The Flash originally aired on the CW Network in the United States from October 10, 2017 to May 22, 2018.  This season, like its predecessors, focused on the adventures of Barry Allen, a forensic scientist with superhuman speed who fights crime as the superhero known as The Flash. At the end of Season 3, Barry had sacrificed himself to the Speed Force in order to keep it stable. Season 4 picks up six months later, with the team at S.T.A.R. Labs dealing with the absence of Barry, who emerges from the Speed Force in the season's premiere, albeit not without repercussions. Season 4 is also notable for introducing a new main antagonist who is not a speedster, unlike the previous seasons. The primary villain of this season is The Thinker, a hyper-intelligent metahuman with the power to control technology and calculate numerous future outcomes. This strategic and cerebral antagonist presents a unique challenge to Team Flash, which results in a more psychological battle in contrast to the physical confrontations of previous seasons. Season 4 also further explores the personal lives and challenges of the supporting characters, including Iris West, Cisco Ramon (Vibe), Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost), Joe West, and newcomer Ralph Dibny (Elongated Man), alongside Barry and a number of recurring characters. The Flash belongs to a larger shared universe of television series known as the Arrowverse, which also includes Arrow, Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow among others. These shows often have crossover events which may affect the storyline of each individual show, with one such event in Season 4 of The Flash titled \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\". Now, depending on the location, audiences who missed the original airing on the CW Network can catch up with Season 4 of The Flash on various streaming platforms such as Netflix. However, the availability of the show can differ by region due to licensing agreements, so it's advised to check the specifics for your specific area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Dan had two children: Karen which had sickle-cell anemia, and his son Bob, which was healthy.  and a hint : The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.  Please answer this question : Which child has a hemoglobin that gives rise to the crescent-shaped cells? The answer to this question is:","output":"Karen has a hemoglobin that gives rise to the crescent-shaped cells. This is because she has sickle-cell anemia, a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for producing hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that binds to oxygen and carries it throughout the body via red blood cells. In individuals with sickle-cell anemia, the mutated hemoglobin causes the red blood cells to clump together, leading to a distortion in their shape. This results in the cells taking on a crescent, or sickle-like appearance. The crescent-shaped cells characteristic of sickle-cell anemia can cause a range of health problems. These misshapen cells can obstruct blood flow in small blood vessels, leading to pain, tissue damage, and a reduced ability to transport oxygen to the body's tissues. This decreased oxygen delivery can result in fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disease, meaning it is passed down from parents to their children through their genes. In Dan's family, his daughter Karen inherited the gene mutation causing sickle-cell anemia, leading to her having the disease. On the other hand, his son Bob did not inherit this mutation and is therefore healthy, with normal hemoglobin and red blood cell shapes. In conclusion, it is Karen, the daughter with sickle-cell anemia, who has a hemoglobin that gives rise to the crescent-shaped cells. Understanding the specific changes in hemoglobin structure and genetics behind this disease has allowed for the development of various treatment options and management strategies to improve the lives of those affected by sickle-cell anemia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: SpaceX rocket explodes while trying to land on drone ship Elon Musk’s SpaceX has experienced another example of “rapid unscheduled disassembly” – which is Musk jargon for “my rocket exploded”. The spaceflight company has been testing a re-usable version of its Falcon 9 rocket, the sub-orbital rocket which it uses, among other things, to deliver supplies to the International Space Station (it started in 2012, making it the first private company to visit the ISS). Rockets are expensive, with a standard launch on the Falcon 9 costing 61m, but those costs can be reduced if the bottom stage of the rocket, which contains most of the engines, could be re-used. To that end, SpaceX has been attempting to land the rockets back safely on a stable surface, rather than letting them drop into the ocean as is typical for launches. It has a purpose-built unmanned “drone ship” built for the purpose (named “Just Read the Instructions” in honour of the science fiction author Iain M Banks) and the rockets are armed with small thrusters to control their descent. Unfortunately, landing a rocket is tricky. Almost exactly a year ago, a Falcon 9 rocket exploded after hitting the ship at a steep angle, causing Musk to coin the phrase “rapid unscheduled disassembly”. This year’s landing went much better, relatively speaking. The rocket landed vertically, and three of the four legs were successfully locked into place. Unfortunately, the fourth did not. Musk shared a video of the landing and subsequent explosion, adding: “Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn’t latch on one [of] the four legs, causing it to tip over post landing. Root cause may have been ice buildup due to condensation from heavy fog at liftoff.” Although the company hasn’t managed to land the rocket on the ship, it did successfully land on solid ground in December. Summary:","output":"SpaceX experienced another setback as their Falcon 9 rocket exploded while attempting to land on a drone ship.

Question: Running a sanding belt over polished metal creates less resistance then running one over raw metal. This means that the _____ is more rough (A) polished metal (B) raw metal","output":"The statement given compares the resistance experienced when running a sanding belt over polished metal and raw metal. From the statement, it is understood that the polished metal creates less resistance than the raw metal. Based on this observation, we can infer that the raw metal is more rough. To gain a deeper understanding, let's define both the terms and delve into their properties: Polished Metal: Polished metal refers to metal that has undergone a finishing process using abrasive materials to improve its appearance, reduce surface imperfections, and provide a smoother surface. Through a series of steps, abrasives with different grit sizes are used to gradually refine and smoothen the surface. The result is a shiny, reflective surface with a high degree of smoothness. Examples of polished metal surfaces include high-quality kitchenware, pristine automobile parts, and ornamental objects. Raw Metal: Raw metal, on the other hand, is metal in its natural, unprocessed state, and it has not undergone any finishing or polishing processes. As a result, raw metal surfaces are typically characterized by unevenness, uneven texture, scratches, pits, or other surface imperfections. The roughness of raw metal surfaces makes them less suitable for certain applications, such as those requiring tight tolerances or an aesthetically pleasing appearance. Considering the characteristics of both polished metal and raw metal, it becomes clear why running a sanding belt over polished metal creates less resistance compared to raw metal. The surface smoothness and uniformity of polished metal cause the abrasive particles on the sanding belt to encounter fewer high spots, imperfections, or unevenness that would cause resistance. Conversely, raw metal, with its rougher and less uniform surface, provides more points of contact and causes the abrasive particles on the sanding belt to work harder in order to smooth the surface, thereby creating more resistance. So in conclusion, the correct answer is (B) raw metal. The raw metal is more rough, as evidenced by the higher resistance experienced when running a sanding belt over it compared to the polished metal. The inherent properties of raw metal surfaces, such as unevenness and surface imperfections, contribute to this increased resistance, making them less smooth than polished metal surfaces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief.

Please answer the following question: This article: Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion.

These range from free programs for low-income families to subsidized care for those in need.","output":"In today's fast-paced world, finding child care outside normal working hours is becoming increasingly necessary for busy parents and guardians. The most logical next event after establishing what you need to do is to explore the various options available to you and choose the best one that caters to your schedule and requirements. Here are some steps to guide you in this process: 1. Research available resources: Start by researching local child care providers and facilities in your area that offer extended hours or overnight services. This can be done by searching online, using resources such as care.com or local government websites, or checking your community bulletin boards for information. 2. Ask for recommendations: Reach out to friends, family, or colleagues who may have experience with child care providers that operate outside of the usual business hours. Their insights and experiences can be valuable in determining the best option for your child. 3. Verify credentials and certifications: Ensure that the child care providers and facilities you are considering have the necessary certifications, accreditations, and licenses to operate legally. Be sure to verify their qualifications as per your state and local guidelines. 4. Investigate safety policies and procedures: Visit the childcare facilities you are considering and inquire about their safety policies and procedures. Make sure the facilities have adequate safety measures in place like emergency plans, fire safety equipment, and a secure environment. 5. Consider affordability and financial assistance: Compare the fees of the child care providers to see which one better fits your budget. If you are in need of financial assistance, explore government subsidies or programs that can help you reduce the cost of child care services. 6. Schedule a meet-and-greet: Set up appointments to meet with the providers and staff to ensure that you feel comfortable with the environment and are confident in the care your child will receive. This is also an opportunity to ask any questions you may have and observe how they interact with the children under their care. 7. Check for flexibility and convenience: Choose a child care provider who can accommodate your schedule, as well as the unexpected changes that can occur in your work routine. Look for facilities or programs that offer flexible drop-off and pick-up times, as well as those that provide a backup plan for care during unforeseen circumstances, such as a provider's illness. 8. Weigh pros and cons: After gathering all the necessary information, evaluate the pros and cons of each child care provider or facility based on their services, quality, safety, affordability, and convenience. Choose the one that best caters to your needs and preferences. 9. Talk to your child: Depending on your child's age, it's crucial to discuss and involve them in the decision-making process. Talk to your child about the new child care provider or facility, and make sure they feel comfortable and excited about the change. Consider their opinion and feelings when making your final decision. 10. Stay involved and maintain communication: Once you have selected a child care provider, establish an open line of communication with them. Regularly check-in to know about your child's progress and any concerns that may arise. Stay involved in your child's care by participating in the provider's activities or parent-teacher meetings when possible. Finding reliable, quality child care outside normal work hours can be a challenging task. By diligently following these steps, you will be better equipped to find the most appropriate care provider that caters to your family's specific needs and requirements. Trust your instincts, and always prioritize the safety, well-being, and happiness of your child."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: The hackers uploaded a text file of the Games of Thrones instalment and an annotated video of the script. They also shared three episodes of popular HBO TV shows on a site created to host what they stole. The group behind the breach said it managed to grab more than 1.5 terabytes of data from the firm. On Monday, when news of the data breach began circulating, HBO confirmed that it had been hit by a \\"cyber-incident\\" that had led to the loss of some data. \\"We immediately began investigating the incident and are working with law enforcement and outside cyber-security firms,\\" it added. Some episodes of the HBO shows Ballers and Room 104 were quickly leaked online. Added to these now are scripts and summaries for episodes three and four of the seventh season of Game of Thrones. The script for episode four bears a date of April 2016, suggesting it was an early draft rather than the finished, filmed episode. Also made available were two episodes of upcoming HBO comedy show Barry and one of the Insecure show. Files containing log-in details for some HBO staff are also believed to have been made available. Several other large files were also put online but so far no-one has been able to work out what is in them. Panda Security urged people to avoid any website that made the stolen files available for copying. \\"Instead of the new season of a hit show, your system may end up getting infected with malicious software,\\" it warned. The security firm added that the hackers behind the breach, or those that share the files around, were not acting benevolently. It said: \\"They are money driven and would gladly steal your information too without any hesitation.\\" HBO is just the latest in a long list of media firms to be hit by hackers, or who have had data stolen. In May, unseen episodes of the Netflix show Orange Is The New Black were put online by a hacker after the media firm refused to pay a ransom for their return.

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet.\\" if \\"A child is asleep.\\"?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet\\" if \\"A child is asleep.\\" These two statements present entirely different situations and cannot be logically connected based on the information provided. To fully explain the reason behind this, we will examine each statement individually and compare them. First, let us break down the statement, \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet.\\" This sentence describes a specific action being performed by a child – the act of climbing a red mat. Additionally, it also provides context for the setting, which is a festive carpet. Based on this information, we can gather that there is an active event taking place involving the child. Now, let us analyze the statement, \\"A child is asleep.\\" This situation presents a completely different scenario – a child is at rest and not actively engaging in any activity. Sleep implies a state of inactivity, and it is not possible for a child to be climbing a red mat while asleep simultaneously. To draw a connection or conclude one statement based on the information provided in the other, there should be some form of logical or contextual relationship between them. In this case, there is no common element or context that enables us to conclude that a little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet simply because a child is asleep. It is important to recognize that there could be further context or information that was not provided. For example, if there was an additional statement revealing that the festive carpet was in the child's dream, it could offer a logical connection between these two seemingly unrelated scenarios. However, based solely on the current information, we cannot make a connection between the sleeping child and the child climbing the red mat. In conclusion, without further information or context, it is not possible to establish a logical connection between \\"A little kid climbs a red mat on a festive carpet\\" and \\"A child is asleep.\\" The two statements, as they stand, describe separate and distinct scenarios that cannot be linked based solely on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The flowers were always delivered to Victoria and not Megan, because","output":"Victoria had a deep-rooted appreciation for the beauty and allure of flowers, cultivated from her early childhood years spent wandering through her grandmother's lush garden. This affinity for botanical delicacies was further strengthened by her innate understanding of the subtle, delicate language that each floral arrangement artfully communicated – a language that Megan, unfortunately, had neither the time nor inclination to learn. It seemed only fitting, then, that the flowers continued to find their rightful home in Victoria's tender embrace. Observed by an outsider, one might have even thought that the very flowers themselves appeared more vibrant and alive upon reaching Victoria's care, as though their ephemeral lives had gained renewed purpose. While some might attribute this phenomenon to mere coincidence or the whims of happenstance, those who knew Victoria well understood that her relationship with these floral tokens went far beyond the reach of human convention. In contrast, Megan approached life with a practical, no-nonsense attitude, leaving little room for the frivolity that she felt flowers often represented. Her priorities were firmly grounded in the tangible aspects of life, such as career success, financial stability, and a meticulous daily routine designed for maximum efficiency. While she couldn't deny the aesthetic appeal of a brilliantly arranged bouquet, Megan often struggled to see the inherent value in trading hard-earned currency for something with such a fleeting lifespan. Despite the marked differences in their individual values and outlooks on life, Victoria and Megan shared a bond that transcended those discrepancies. In many ways, their diverging perspectives intersected to create a harmonious balance – Victoria's penchant for finding joy in the details of life's natural beauty served to remind Megan of the importance of appreciating the quiet, simple moments, just as Megan's dedication to responsibility and pragmatism grounded Victoria when her whimsy threatened to carry her away entirely. Thus, in the grand tapestry of their intertwined lives, the continuous delivery of flowers to Victoria rather than Megan held a deeper significance, acting as a subtle nod to their unspoken understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. By celebrating Victoria's ability to cherish the fleeting beauty of these delicate floral gifts – an art lost on Megan – they reaffirmed the value of those intricacies that made each of them who they were, and, ultimately, strengthened the cherished bond they shared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How does The Chosen One train? Movie title: Kung Pow! Enter the Fist Movie plot: A man, called The Chosen One by the narrator, wanders from town to town to search for the man who killed his family and tried to kill him when he was a baby. In one town, he meets Master Tang, a very ill and slightly deranged sifu, and asks Tang to help him improve his already impressive martial arts ability. Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One's mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, who has feelings for him. While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen kick him repeatedly in the groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain's skills, the town's mayor hires him, and he randomly changes his name to Betty. The Chosen One attempts to train himself by letting people kick him in the groin, but is knocked out after being hit. When he wakes up, a mysterious woman named Whoa warns him not to rush to fight Betty. After flirtily fighting The Chosen One, Whoa flies off into the sky. Ignoring the advice, The Chosen One sets off to find Betty. He comes across one of Betty's evil companions: Moo Nieu (pronounced \\"moon you\\"), a Holstein cow gifted in karate, with a large udder that can squirt milk as a weapon. They fight in a scene parodying The Matrix, and The Chosen One eventually incapacitates Moo Nieu by milking her until her udder is empty. He sees Betty at a waterfall and confronts him. Master Doe, Ling's Father, shows up and tries to stop the unprepared Chosen One, and is wounded by Betty. The Chosen One takes Master Doe to Master Tang; it turns out they are old friends. However, as Tang massages Doe's wound,... A:","output":"The Chosen One trains mainly under Master Tang in his dojo. Initially, his training consists of improving his already impressive martial arts ability under the supervision and guidance of Master Tang. He gets to practice with other students, such as Wimp Lo and Ling, and showcases cartoon-like feats of strength during his training. However, The Chosen One also tries to train himself independently by mimicking some of the things he sees others do, like allowing people to kick him in the groin, which eventually only leads to him being knocked out. In addition, he is warned by the mysterious woman named Whoa not to rush into the fight against Betty, and she even engages him in a flirtatious fight, but he doesn't heed her advice and continues to seek Betty. The Chosen One also gains experience through the battles he encounters, like the one with Moo Nieu, where he learns to defeat his opponent by emptying her udder. In summary, The Chosen One trains through a combination of dojo training with Master Tang, independent practice, learning from encounters and experiences, and advice from other characters."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Both a modest homage to its writer and a melancholy look at a lost world. 3. Tati and Chomet are saying something complex but true here, testifying to the necessity of fakery while acknowledging that illusions can be cruel. The result is one beautiful movie -- and no less so for making a strong case that beauty is a lie. 4. A cliché-riddled nostalgia trip. 5. Touching, beautiful drama about the magic of friendship. 6. Although the plot is slight and the film's ending may polarize viewers (some will find it poignant while others may think it cynical), \\"The Illusionist\\" makes for enjoyable viewing as well as a loving tribute to a cinematic master. 7. If The Triplets of Belleville was a rollicking, proudly eccentric adventure, then The Illusionist is something much more bittersweet, a love letter to silent showmanship and a lament for its obsolescence on both stage and screen. 8. If 2-D animated films soon become relics, The Illusionist will be one of the final treasures of the art form. 9. From a technical perspective, Chomet's work is uncanny ... but [he] only captures the form of Tati without much of the function. 10. A return to the possibilities of animation as Fantasia, with its multiple tones, varied episodes and restless invention, timelessly realized. Summary:","output":"The film under critique, seemingly \\"The Illusionist,\\" garners a sense of melancholic nostalgia and remembrance of a bygone era, with its aesthetic design and thematics paying tribute to the cinematic past while contributing to the bittersweet tone noted by several reviewers. As suggested in reviews one and two, the movie is appreciated as a 'mood piece' exuding a strong melancholic tone, providing a modest homage to its writer and offering a sorrowful view of a lost world. The unique approach taken by directors Tati and Chomet received commendation in the third review, with the implication that they delineate the paradox of necessary illusion, sometimes marked by cruelty. The movie, in achieving this feat, solidifies its position as a beautiful artistic piece, despite its underlining message questioning the authenticity of beauty. The fourth review critiques the movie for being oversaturated with clichés and overly nostalgic in its presentation. However, the fifth review steers away from this sentiment, focusing on the beautiful drama woven around the themes of friendship and magic. The sixth and seventh reviews highlight the film's role as a tribute, celebrating cinematic masters and the art of silent showmanship. They acknowledge a potential divide in audience opinion regarding the film's ending, hinting at the potential controversy regarding its viewpoint on pessimism and cynicism. A few reviews suggest that the movie can be seen as a final testament to the art form of 2-D animation, thus, positioning \\"The Illusionist\\" as a treasured piece of this soon-to-be obsolete medium. Not all reviews are in agreement, with the ninth review, in particular, critiquing Chomet's work for mimicking the form of Tati but failing to capture its function fully. Finally, the tenth review sees the film as a re-exploitation of the possibilities inherent in animation, likening its inventive approach to the classic 'Fantasia,' celebrated for its various tones, episodic layout, and timeless realization. Despite some critiques on its cliches and potential polarizing ending, \\"The Illusionist\\" is still largely regarded as a beautifully animated, bittersweet tribute to the cinematic past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: What is so bad about genetically modified crops? Second question: What is wrong with genetically modified crops? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let me address whether the two questions are asking the same thing or not. While the questions are indeed quite similar, and both are related to potential issues surrounding genetically modified crops, there could be some nuances in how each question is approached. The first question, \\"What is so bad about genetically modified crops?\\" assumes that there is something inherently bad about genetically modified (GM) crops, while the second question, \\"What is wrong with genetically modified crops?\\" seems to be inquiring about the specific problems or issues with GM crops. Nonetheless, I will provide a detailed response addressing the concerns raised by both questions.  Genetically modified crops have been a subject of debate for many years. Proponents of GM crops argue that they can help increase crop yields, improve resistance to pests and diseases, and contribute to global food security. On the other hand, critics raise various concerns including potential risks to human health, adverse environmental impacts, and socioeconomic issues. It's crucial to understand that assessing the potential negative implications of genetically modified crops isn't a straightforward process, as various factors determine their potential risks, including the specific traits engineered into the crops and the regulatory and management practices in place. 1. Human health concerns: Some critics argue that consuming genetically modified crops could have negative effects on human health. They mention potential allergic reactions, toxicity, and antibiotic resistance resulting from the insertion of new genes into various crops. However, numerous scientific studies and regulatory agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have deemed genetically modified crops safe for human consumption after passing rigorous safety assessments. 2. Environmental impact: One of the main concerns regarding genetically modified crops is their potential to negatively impact the ecosystem and biodiversity. A key example lies in the development of pesticide-resistant crops, which has led to the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds (also known as \\"superweeds\\") in some regions. Additionally, the use of pest-resistant GM crops may lead to the development of resistance in insects, rendering the crops ineffective in the long term. Critics also worry about the possibility of gene flow between GM crops and their wild relatives, which may result in the uncontrolled spreading of modified genes into the environment. Although most regulatory systems require containment measures to prevent gene flow, there's still the potential for unforeseen consequences. 3. Socioeconomic consequences: Genetically modified crops have raised concerns about the concentration of power and control in the hands of a few multinational corporations that develop, patent, and distribute GM seeds. These corporations often hold exclusive patents on their seeds, which may restrict farmers' choice and traditional practices of seed saving and trade. This could lead to a loss of agricultural diversity and make small-scale farmers reliant on a limited number of companies for their seeds. Furthermore, critics argue that genetically modified crops may lead to the overemphasis on a few high-yielding varieties, potentially reducing the variety of food crops available to consumers and farmers alike. Dependency on a narrow genetic base can make crops more vulnerable to diseases and pests, with potentially disastrous consequences for global food security. 4. Ethical and cultural considerations: Some people may have ethical or religious objections to consuming food derived from genetically modified organisms, based on personal values or cultural beliefs. For instance, modifying a plant's genetic makeup by introducing genes from animals may be considered unacceptable by some religious or cultural groups. It is worth noting that while these concerns are valid, GM crops may also offer some benefits, such as improved food security and reduced use of harmful chemical pesticides. Moreover, the issues associated with genetically modified crops could potentially be addressed by implementing stricter regulations, rigorous research and development, and enhanced transparency. Nevertheless, understanding and addressing the concerns surrounding genetically modified crops is crucial for making informed decisions as a society and weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Everything matters.\\" Does it follow that \\"Everything matters to me.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"Everything matters\\" can be interpreted in various ways, depending on the context it is being used in. Generally, it implies that every aspect, element, or occurrence holds a certain level of significance, either individually or as part of a larger whole. However, this statement does not inherently imply that everything matters specifically to you or any one individual. To further examine how this statement applies to the notion of \\"Everything matters to me,\\" we must break it down into three different perspectives: personal, relational, and universal. 1. Personal perspective: From an individual point of view, the statement \\"Everything matters to me\\" implies that all aspects, variables, and events in life have a certain level of importance and impact on your personal experiences, thoughts, and emotions. It suggests that you recognize and embrace the interconnectedness of life and are open to learn, grow, and adapt from every experience or encounter. While this perspective fosters personal growth and promotes self-awareness, it is important to realize that not all individuals hold this belief. 2. Relational perspective: From a relational standpoint, the statement suggests that you value and acknowledge the importance of other people's experiences, thoughts, and feelings. This attitude encourages empathy, open-mindedness, and inclusiveness, fostering stronger relationships and a deeper understanding of the world and the people in it. However, this perspective still does not automatically imply that everything holds the same level of importance or impact for others as it does for you. 3. Universal perspective: From a broader, universal perspective, \\"Everything matters\\" communicates the idea that all aspects of existence, irrespective of time, space, or scale, are intrinsically intertwined and essential to the workings of the universe. This outlook emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things and encourages a sense of unity, oneness, and collective responsibility. Nevertheless, while the notion of things intrinsically mattering in the universe might be true, it does not necessarily connote that everything matters to each individual in the same way. In conclusion, the statement \\"Everything matters\\" does not directly equate to \\"Everything matters to me.\\" The level of importance and impact that different aspects or events have on an individual's life may vary based on personal experiences, beliefs, and values. While embracing the idea that everything matters can lead to greater self-awareness, personal growth, and a more compassionate approach towards others, it is essential to remember that not everyone may share the same interpretation or indeed, everything might not matter equally to every person."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the best way to: sledgehammer","output":"Well, sweetie, using a sledgehammer isn't really a game like playing with your toys, it's serious work stuff. But I can definitely tell you about it in a simpler way.  Using a sledgehammer would be like you using a much, much bigger version of your toy hammer. But instead of playing, people usually use it to break big things like walls or rocks. Here's how adults do it:  1. They start by standing with their feet apart, almost like they are ready to do a big jump! 2. They hold the sledgehammer with both hands, one hand at the top of the handle near their body, and other is near the bottom.  3. Then they lift the hammer over their shoulder just like you see in cartoons! 4. And then comes the fun part, they swing the hammer forward and hit the thing they want to break, just like hitting a piñata!

Wealthy Londoners can now park their supercars in the city’s most exclusive area for just £2.30 a day - if they are willing to pay £85,000 for the spot. Three spaces in a car park on Park Lane in Mayfair, central London, have been put on the market on century-long leases for a combined £255,000. But despite the eye-watering price-tag, the parking spots in W1 work out considerably cheaper than if motorists wanted to pay per day. Pricey spot: Three spaces in this car park on Park Lane in Mayfair, central London, have been put on the market for a combined £255,000. Good value: Despite the eye-watering price-tag, the parking spots in W1 work out considerably cheaper than if motorists wanted to pay per day. It would normally cost £9 per hour, £49 for 24 hours or £3,600 for a 12-month parking ticket at the car park. These spaces work out at around £2.30 per day for the duration of the leases, which vary between 105 and 110 years.

They have also been described as an excellent investment with Mayfair parking in demand as more properties are returned to residential use.

Translate to English","output":"For the prudential supervision of the management company from section 2. The phrase \\"Za obezřetnostní dohled nad správcovskou společností od­ 2\\" is written in Czech. The translation to English highlights the importance of prudential supervision for the proper functioning of a management company. This supervision serves as a regulatory safeguard in order to ensure the stability, efficient operation, and ethical practices of the management company. Prudential supervision typically involves the oversight of financial institutions and organizations by national or international authorities. The main objective of this type of supervision is to maintain the integrity and stability of the financial system, as well as protecting investors, consumers, and the overall economy. In the context of a management company, prudential supervision encompasses a variety of duties and responsibilities. This can include monitoring the financial position, risk management processes, corporate governance, and business operations of the company. It also involves ensuring that the organization complies with all relevant regulatory requirements, laws, and standards. The role of prudential supervision in a management company is crucial because it helps to minimize risks and ensure the long-term viability and performance of the firm. A well-regulated financial system promotes investor confidence, fosters economic growth, and reduces the likelihood of financial crises and collapses. Some key aspects of prudential supervision in a management company include: 1. Capital adequacy: Ensuring that the management company maintains sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and continue its operations in the event of adverse market conditions or financial stress. 2. Risk management: Assessing and monitoring the company's risk profile, as well as ensuring that appropriate risk mitigation strategies, policies, and procedures are in place to manage and control risks effectively. 3. Corporate governance: Ensuring that the company adheres to strong corporate governance practices, including transparency, accountability, effective risk management, and a robust internal control system. 4. Compliance: Monitoring the company's compliance with regulatory requirements, reporting obligations, and standards of ethical conduct. 5. Financial reporting and disclosure: Ensuring that the organization provides accurate and timely financial information to regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to enable informed decision-making. 6. Prudential reporting and regulatory communication: Ensuring that the company maintains open lines of communication with regulatory authorities to facilitate ongoing monitoring and supervision, and to promptly address any concerns or issues that may arise. The reference to \\"section 2\\" in the translated phrase may suggest that this prudential supervision responsibility or guideline is part of a broader document, agreement, or regulatory framework. It is crucial for stakeholders, regulators, and management companies to understand and adhere to these prudential supervision requirements to maintain a safe and financially sound environment for all parties involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Sensing phantom phone vibrations  is a strangely common experience. Around 80% of us have imagined a phone vibrating in our pockets when it's actually completely still. Almost 30% of us have also heard non-existent ringing. Are these signs of madness caused by digital culture? Not at all. In fact, phantom vibrations and ringing indicate a fundamental principle in psychology. Psychologists use a concept called Signal Detection Theory to guide their thinking about the problem of perceptual  judgments. Working through the example of phone vibrations, we can see how this theory explains why they are a common and unavoidable part of healthy mental function. When your phone is in your pocket, the world is in one of two possible states: the phone is either ringing or not. You also have two possible states of mind: the judgment that the phone is ringing, or the judgment that it isn't. Obviously you'd like to match these states in the correct way. True vibrations should go with \\"it's ringing\\", and no vibrations should go with \\"it's not ringing\\". Signal detection theory calls these faithful matches a \\"hit\\" and a \\"correct rejection\\" But there are two other possible combinations: you could mismatch true vibrations with \\"it's not ringing\\" (a \\"miss\\"); or mismatch the absence of vibrations with \\"it's ringing\\" (a \\"false alarm\\"). This second kind of mismatch is what's going on when you imagine a phantom phone vibration. What does that mean in terms of your phone? We can assume that people like to notice when their phone is ringing, and that most people hate missing a call. This means their perceptual systems have adjusted their bias  to a level that makes misses unlikely. The unavoidable cost is a raised likelihood of false alarms of phantom phone vibrations. The trade-off between false alarms and misses also explains why we all have to put up with fire alarms going off when there isn't a fire. It isn't that the alarms are badly designed, but rather that they are very sensible to smoke and heat and biased to avoid missing a real fire at all costs. The outcome is a rise in the number of false alarms. These are inconvenient, but nowhere near as inconvenient as burning to death in your bed or office. The alarms are designed to err on the side of caution.   Question: The writer tries to explain phantom phone vibrations_.

It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them.

Q:SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Place a large pot onto a set of kitchen scales and set the display back to zero. Slowly scoop in or pour in your rendered animal fat until you have as close to 1 lb (450 g) as possible.  Getting the measurements exactly right is crucial, as soap-making and glycerin making rely on a precise chemical reaction. Not having the right amount of fat can lead to caustic soap or glycerin that can be very harmful. If you want to alter the exact measurements for your own soap recipe and the type of fat you are using, look online for a soap making calculator. There are plenty that will allow you to enter the amount and types of fat you are using and give you precise instructions for the right ratios. In a separate jug or bowl, measure out 5 fluid ounces (150 ml) of room temperature water. Slowly add in 2 ounces (57 g) of lye, stirring constantly as you do so to incorporate it fully. Leave the lye and water mixture to react and cool down.  The water and the lye will combine and create an exothermic reaction, meaning the mixture will heat up. You should always wear protective gloves and eyewear when working with lye, as it is a caustic substance that eats away at fat. If you get any lye on your skin, remove any clothing the lye may have touched and flush the skin with cold water for 15 minutes. Seek medical attention immediately. Lye may be available in the cleaning section of your local grocery store. It should be easily available online or at a specialty soap-making store. Use a candy or other food thermometer to check the temperature of your rendered animal fat. Place the pot over low heat to slowly bring the temperature up to 113 °F (45 °C) if it’s too cold, or leave it to cool down if the fat is too warm. Once it’s at the right temperature, remove it from any heat source. Keeping the temperatures exactly right will help the fat and the lye to combine properly, resulting in a smoother soap and clearer glycerin. With both the fat and the lye solution around 113 °F (45 °C), begin very slowly streaming the lye solution into the fat. Stir the solution in as you do, being careful not to splash the lye or get any on your skin.  It may be easier to get someone to help you stir the fat while you pour in the lye. Work on a sturdy, flat surface so that you can continue stirring easily while the soap mixture thickens. Once the lye solution has been completely mixed into the fat, keep stirring in slow, regular motions. After around 15 minutes, the path of the spoon should remain visible in the soap mixture for a few seconds. This is known as tracing and is a sign that your soap mixture has thickened and is ready. Rather than stirring by hand, you could use an electric mixer or a stick blender to combine the lye and fat. Start at a low speed to avoid splashing the mixture around too much.","output":"Okay, let me make it simple for you. When making soap, you need a big pot on a scale to weigh about 1 pound of animal fat. Measure everything carefully because it's important for soap and glycerin to work well. You can find help online for the right measurements. Next, mix water and lye in a separate bowl. Be super careful with lye, it can hurt your skin. If lye gets on your skin, wash it with cold water and get help from a doctor. You can find lye at the store or online. Now, check the fat's temperature and make sure it's 113 degrees Fahrenheit. When the fat and lye solution are both at the right temperature, slowly pour the lye into the fat while stirring. Mix it well until it becomes thicker. Then your soap mixture is ready! Using an electric mixer can also help with mixing. Just remember to always be careful and ask an adult for help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Fact 2: Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What increases ultraviolet light?\\" with the following options:  - heating liquids  - clouds  - smog  - emissions  - less ozone  - gravity  - sun's heat  - photons A:","output":"The correct answer to the question \\"What increases ultraviolet light?\\" given the two facts listed is less ozone. Let me explain this in more detail. Fact 1 states that ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. This means that as the ozone layer thins, more ultraviolet (UV) radiation can penetrate Earth's atmosphere, which leads to various environmental and health issues. Fact 2 states that ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation. Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms (O3) and is found primarily in Earth's stratosphere. The ozone layer acts as a natural shield, protecting life on Earth from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Ozone molecules absorb the UV radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the surface of our planet. Given both facts and the options provided, we can conclude that \\"less ozone\\" is the most accurate answer. Now, I'll give you a brief explanation of each option and explain why they don't increase ultraviolet light: - Heating liquids: Heating liquids doesn't have a direct impact on UV radiation. Heated liquids may emit thermal radiation, but they do not increase UV levels in the atmosphere. - Clouds: Clouds can reflect, absorb, or scatter UV radiation, but generally, they do not significantly increase UV levels. Instead, they can sometimes lower the UV radiation reaching the surface depending on cloud thickness and other factors. - Smog: Smog can sometimes have a slight impact on UV radiation by scattering or absorbing it, but it is not a primary factor that leads to an increase in UV levels. - Emissions: Emissions indirectly contribute to less ozone by increasing greenhouse gases and creating an environment where ozone depletion may occur. However, emissions alone do not directly lead to an increase in UV radiation. - Gravity: Gravity does not have a direct relationship with UV radiation levels. It is a fundamental force that governs the interaction of matter but does not directly contribute to UV levels. - Sun's heat: UV radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is produced by the sun, but sun's heat (thermal energy) does not directly lead to an increase in UV radiation. - Photons: Photons are particles of light, including UV radiation, but they are a result of UV radiation and not a cause. In summary, given the two facts and the options provided, less ozone is the primary factor that increases ultraviolet light, as it allows for more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface. The other factors listed do not directly lead to a significant increase in UV levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What does exercising immediately lead to? Possible A: relaxation, exhaustion, energetic, become stronger, use energy  Why is \\"exhaustion\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"Exhaustion as an answer aligned with human common sense is rooted in the general understanding of how physical activity affects the human body in the short term. When an individual engages in exercise, their muscles, cardiovascular system, and respiratory system are all subjected to increased demands. The human body, in turn, responds by delivering necessary resources, such as oxygen and nutrients, to meet these demands. As a result, various physiological and biochemical processes take place, which can ultimately lead to the feeling of exhaustion. Several factors contribute to making exhaustion a logical, common-sense answer to the question, as detailed below. 1. Energy expenditure: Exercise involves the expenditure of energy, which is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in our cells. During physical activity, ATP is broken down to provide the necessary energy for muscle contractions. As the intensity and duration of exercise increase, the body relies more heavily on its energy stores. Consequently, the depletion of ATP and other energy substrates can lead to the sensation of tiredness or exhaustion. 2. Muscle fatigue: Exercising activates specific muscle groups, which contract repeatedly during the activity. Prolonged muscle contractions cause the accumulation of metabolic byproducts, such as lactate, hydrogen ions, and inorganic phosphate in the muscle tissue. These byproducts contribute to muscle fatigue, which manifests as a reduced capacity for muscle force production. In other words, muscles feel weaker and less able to perform effectively, resulting in overall exhaustion. 3. Cardiovascular and respiratory adaptations: The human body must adapt quickly to the increased oxygen and nutrient demands of exercise. The heart pumps more blood, the blood vessels dilate, and the respiratory rate escalates to facilitate the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to working muscles. While these adaptations ensure that the body can meet the increased demands of physical activity, they can also be perceived in the form of elevated heart rate, heavy breathing, and, ultimately, exhaustion. 4. Central nervous system fatigue: Exercise affects not only the muscles but also the central nervous system. Prolonged or intense exercise can lead to the overstimulation of certain neurotransmitters, affecting cognitive functions and contributing to the feeling of tiredness or exhaustion. 5. Psychological exhaustion: Exercising can also be mentally taxing, as individuals need to concentrate, coordinate, and motivate themselves through challenging physical activities. The mental exertion required during exercise might lead to psychological fatigue, which can contribute to the overall sensation of exhaustion. 6. Recovery period: Lastly, it is essential to note that the body needs time to recover from exercise. After a workout, muscles, joints, and connective tissues need time to rest, repair, and adapt or grow stronger. Without sufficient recovery time, an individual may experience persistent exhaustion as they consistently engage in exercise without giving their body adequate time to recuperate. In conclusion, exhaustion is an answer to the question, \\"What does exercising immediately lead to?\\" grounded in human common sense because it is a natural and expected outcome of physical activity. The physiological, biomechanical, and psychological aspects of exercise ultimately contribute to the sensation of exhaustion at various levels, making it a relatable and sensible response. However, it is important to note that the degree and timing of exhaustion may vary depending on the individual, the type of exercise, and the intensity and duration of the activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Two colleagues studied human evolution, Dan studied early humans, from around 200,000 years ago, while Bob studied human settlements from 10,000 years ago.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student learned more about nomadic gatherers?  Hint: The earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth. Answer:","output":"Dan learned more about nomadic gatherers because he studied early humans from around 200,000 years ago which includes the time when early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. On the other hand, Bob studied human settlements from 10,000 years ago, which is a later period when humans had already colonized various parts of the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

President Obama returned to Washington D.C. after cutting short his Christmas vacation and the Senate is going back into session, but the Republican ruled House is still out on recess as the deadline of January 1st looms that could damage a still fragile recovery. House Republican leaders on Wednesday said they remain ready to negotiate, but urged the Senate to consider or amend a OPTIONS: - Americans-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Associated Press-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Capitol-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Christmas-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Congress-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Hawaii-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - House of Representatives-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Obama-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Republican-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Senate-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Timothy Geithner-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - U.S.-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - Washington D.C.-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates.","output":"Correct Answer(s):  - House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. - House of Representatives-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. Explanation:  The correct answers are \\"House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates\\" and \\"House of Representatives-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates\\" because the House of Representatives (also simply known as the House) is where bills of this nature would originate.  The other choices are wrong because these entities (like individuals, locations, and other organizations) do not pass bills. In the U.S., bills are typically crafted and passed by legislative bodies such as the House of Representatives and the Senate. For instance, individuals such as President Obama or Timothy Geithner can suggest or endorse bills, but they can't pass them. Locations like Hawaii and Washington D.C. or organizations like Associated Press also don't pass bills. So remember, just like when we play a game, we have rules, same way in the government, only certain groups, like the House, can make these official rules or 'bills'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance... contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the daughter of the man who premiered a stream of \\"desk drawer\\" works in 1953?, what is it ?

This began with the passing of the Act of Union in 1840, which created the Province of Canada. Responsible government was first granted to Nova Scotia in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the British North America Act, 1867 by the British Parliament, Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the Dominion of Canada, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of international relations.

Some of our preferences are clearly psychological.Dark blue is the color of the night sky and therefore connected with calm, while yellow is a day color connected with energy and encouragement.Experiments have shown that colors, partly because they are connected with psychology, also have a direct effect on people's mind.People in bright red surroundings show an increase in breathing speed, heartbeat and blood pressure.Red is exciting.Pure blue has exactly the opposite effect; it is a calming color.Being exciting, red was chosen as the signal for danger, but a closer study shows that a bright yellow can produce a more basic state of alarm, so fire engines in some advanced areas are now rushing around in bright yellow colors that stop buses, trucks and cars.

So many kids, so many stories. Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day.

Sentence: \\"John put books in the box.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" to be acceptable linguistically. This evaluation is based on several factors, including syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Let's analyze each of these aspects to understand why the sentence is deemed linguistically acceptable. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence to create well-formed sentences in a language. In English, the general syntax of sentences often follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. In the given sentence, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"put\\" is the verb, and \\"books\\" is the object. The prepositional phrase \\"in the box\\" provides additional information about where the action took place. Hence, the sentence adheres to the standard rules of English word order and appears syntactically well-formed.  2. Semantics: Semantics pertains to the meanings behind words, phrases, and sentences. The sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" conveys a clear and coherent idea—that the individual named John performed the action of putting books inside a box. Each word serves a specific purpose and carries an explicit meaning within the context of the sentence. As a result, the sentence is semantically acceptable.  3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics refers to the study of language in terms of its use and context, as well as its inferred meaning in different situations. The sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" can be easily understood in various contexts, such as moving to a new house, organizing a room, or packing up items. It is a straightforward sentence that does not require extensive contextual information to process its meaning. Therefore, it meets the criteria for pragmatic acceptability. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"John put books in the box\\" as acceptable linguistically due to its well-formed syntax, clear semantics, and understandable pragmatics. The sentence complies with the basic rules of the English language and conveys a coherent, situationally adaptable message."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Context: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Answer: Choose your answer from: -Make it more pigmented and less shiny -Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have -Create a strictly plum color and a strictly pearl color -not enough information The answer is:","output":"Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails. There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University. Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails. 1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break. 2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration. 3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging. 4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid. 5. Kidney and liver problems can create \\"half-and-half nails\\", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick. Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? - Doctors can tell us something about our health by looking at our nails. - We should see a doctor if we find nails in bad condition. - A famous doctor in the USA conducted an interesting research. - If we don't want to get ill, we need to clean and stop biting our fingernails.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Available options:  1). yes;  2). it is not possible to tell;  3). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first one, we need to analyse if the information in the second sentence can be deduced from the first one. Sentence 1: \\"And I just don't like that\\" Sentence 2: \\"I really do not enjoy that.\\" Both sentences express a similar sentiment of disliking or not enjoying something. In Sentence 1, \\"And I just don't like that\\" shows a negative emotion towards something unspecified. Here, the dislike could imply a range of emotions from a mild distaste to a strong aversion. Similarly, Sentence 2, \\"I really do not enjoy that\\" also indicates a negative feeling towards something non-specific. The phrase \\"do not enjoy\\" could also cover a variety of negative thoughts or feelings, from mild dislike to strong aversion. So, even though the expressions of their sentiment differ slightly, the second sentence expresses the same general idea contained within the first – the speaker has a negative emotion towards something.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

Wondering about something does not directly lead to the act of exiting a house. - \\"Take shoes off\\": This option is actually counterintuitive. Generally, kids put on shoes before going outside to protect their feet and keep them clean. Taking off shoes does not help them go outside; instead, it prepares them to stay indoors. - \\"Become adults\\": This option is irrelevant because becoming an adult is not a prerequisite for going outside.

Answer the following question: -  The blood travels into the neophrons - Waste is expelled via the neophrons - The waste goes to the bladder in the form of urine - The clean blood exits the kidneys.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the transportation of blood into the kidneys. This is facilitated by the renal arteries, which branch off from the abdominal aorta and carry oxygenated blood rich in waste products towards the kidneys. In order to understand this process, it is essential to comprehend the overall function of the kidneys and their role in maintaining the body's balance and health. The primary function of the kidneys is to filter waste products, excess water, and electrolytes from the bloodstream, which then form urine. This filtration process is essential for maintaining the body's proper chemical balance, blood volume, and blood pressure. In more depth, when the oxygen-rich blood enters the kidneys through the renal arteries, it first passes through a network of tiny blood vessels called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is part of a functional unit within the kidneys known as the nephron. Each kidney possesses millions of nephrons that work in parallel to filter the blood, remove waste products, and reabsorb useful substances back into the bloodstream. As the blood flows through the glomerulus, it is under high pressure, which forces small molecules, waste products, and excess water to be pushed out of the blood and into the Bowman's capsule, another component of the nephron. This filtrate, composed of water, glucose, amino acids, ions, and urea, then travels down the renal tubule. During its passage through the renal tubule, the filtrate undergoes several processes, including reabsorption and secretion. Essential substances like glucose, amino acids, and ions are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, while other substances like hydrogen ions and drugs are secreted into the filtrate to be excreted. This process ensures that only the waste products and unneeded substances are expelled from the body. As the filtrate continues its course, it gradually becomes more concentrated, and excess water is reabsorbed, turning it into what we commonly know as urine. This urine then travels through the collecting ducts of each nephron, which ultimately merges to form the renal pelvis. From the renal pelvis, urine flows down the ureters and into the urinary bladder, where it is stored until it is eventually expelled from the body during urination. In summary, the first step of the process is the transportation of oxygen-rich blood loaded with waste products into the kidneys via the renal arteries. This step initiates the crucial filtration and urine formation processes that ultimately maintain the body's chemical balance, blood volume, and blood pressure."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young man, David (Whannell), is in an interrogation room talking to an unnamed, unsympathetic police officer (Paul Moder).

These may not provide the same versatility as general apps, but may be useful for themed occasions such as the holidays or birthdays. You may have options available such as making a fake identity for your mystery caller, using a contact from your contact’s list, pre-recording audio and scheduling the call.

Select from the following.  - different meanings;  - the same meaning;","output":"The word \\"notice\\" in the next two sentences has different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"A notice of sale,\\" the word \\"notice\\" refers to an announcement or notification. This is a formal statement or sign, usually written or printed, that communicates certain information to the public or a specific group of people. In this context, the information being communicated is about a sale. Meanwhile, the second sentence, \\"He took no notice of the changes, and went on as though nothing had happened,\\" uses the word \\"notice\\" to represent the act of observing, paying attention, or becoming aware of something. In this case, taking no notice of the changes means the person has not acknowledged or been mindful of the changes that have occurred. The action of not taking notice implies that the person has chosen to ignore, or perhaps just simply failed to recognize, the changes.

He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France. The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator. All told, Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated 45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another 12 million in precious metals and jewels; atop that, his forces confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures. Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero. He met Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister—who later served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"(b). yes. These two questions are indeed asking the same thing: the visual capability of cockroaches. They both seek an understanding of how well cockroaches can see. To address this inquiry, it is essential to consider the structure and function of a cockroach's eyes, as they play a crucial role in their vision. Cockroaches are insects belonging to the order Blattodea. They possess compound eyes, which are a common feature among insects. These eyes consist of several individual photoreceptor units called ommatidia. With hundreds of ommatidia covering the surface of their eyes, cockroaches can gather information about their environment and detect movement. Although cockroaches can see, their vision is significantly different from that of humans. Cockroach eyes are adapted to perceive light and movement rather than focusing on detailed images. Their eyes are more sensitive to light in comparison to human eyes, which enables them to function well in low-light conditions. This is an important adaptation for these nocturnal creatures, as they are more active during the night and often inhabit dark spaces. Cockroaches can see in a wider range than humans, thanks to their convex-shaped eyes. Besides providing a panoramic view of their surroundings, their compound eyes also allow them to detect rapid movements. This feature is essential for their survival, as it helps them to quickly escape from potential predators or dangers. In summary, cockroaches can see relatively well for their specific needs and environmental conditions. Their compound eyes provide them with excellent light sensitivity, wide-range detection, and rapid movement recognition. Despite their limited ability to perceive detailed images, their eyes offer them powerful adaptations for navigating and surviving in their environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One girl in our class always made fun of me because my dad was a plumber and hers was a lawyer , and she would say things like, \\"Ew, that's gross !\\" I must admit I was sometimes embarrassed by what my dad did, especially in my early teens, when the only thing I really cared about was what the other girls thought. The girl lived a few streets away from us, and one winter day---the day her elder sister was getting married---the toilet in their main upstairs bathroom broke and there was water everywhere. Her father, the lawyer called every plumber in the Yellow Page, but nobody would come and because we were having a major snowstorm. Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.) My father fixed the toilet, help them clean up everything, and didn't take much time for his trouble. But as we were leaving, he told the girl, \\"If I ever need a lawyer, I'll be happy to call your dad.\\" As we walked to our car, he said to me, \\"Do you believe he didn't know where the main shut-off valve  was?

We've been to this Fleming's on several occasions, and tonight seemed to be a continuation of the progression downhill for this restaurant, in my opinion.  We decided to make this a family of four dinner, bringing our 10 and 12 year olds.  Obviously, we tried to stick with steak at this steak house.  We came at opening, about 5pm, arriving at 4:50.  They did have us wait until they were ready at 5pm, and that's okay.  The opening, though, plays a big part later in this review.  We stuck with water, as you can run up a really high bill very quickly.  Our orders were taken late (about 15 minute wait)  because we had not ordered drinks, and the waiters were busy brining out wine, etc, to the other tables.  The bread was fresh, but the butter was not.  It was dried out, like it had been frozen, and we were served the freezer burnt butter.  I asked for the Crab Cake appetizer to be brought out at the same time as everyone else's plate.  This was screwed up, and was brought out early.  So everyone else had to watch me eat.  I was having this as a \\"small plate\\" dish.  The boys had the specials, which were a petite filet mignon along with 3 scallops.  We asked for medium--they were undercooked, more along the lines of rare to medium-rare.  The scallops were well cooked, but a little bland.  The 10 year old did not like them, and he usually really enjoys seafood.  I added on the Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese for the kids, which they liked, along with Half and Half, which is shoestring fries with Onion Rings, both tasted okay.  My wife had the Double Thick Pork Rib Chop.  The sauce was very tasty, BUT the pork was underdone, and was visibly raw in the middle.  This was unacceptable.  We had to send the plate back, which was put under the broiler, and then brought back to us.  I have to say this is the second time in a row that my wife's meat was raw at this Fleming's.  I would've chalked it up to oven not being hot enough for the first dishes, but this seems to be a recurrent problem.    I had a small plate, the Sliced Filet Mignon, which is served on Risotto.  The meat was very well done, but the risotto was completely dried out and tasteless. I was very disappointed.  As it took about another 10-15 minutes between when our plates were taken away and our waiter came with the dessert menu, we had decided to skip dessert and coffee and make our way to Starbucks, about two buildings away.  I'm willing to forgive the delays due to them just opening up.  Plus, it was Veteran's Day.  However, the food being underprepared for the second time in a row is unforgivable, especially for as expensive a restaurant as Fleming's is.  This is really starting to feel like a \\"chain\\" restaurant as it really is rather than an exclusive steak restaurant, which they strive to be.  Overall, I think we're done with Fleming's.","output":"The sentiment of the given review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with their dining experience at Fleming's, citing various issues they encountered during their visit.

Summarize: When buying some Calpol in a large pharmacy chain, the poster said she had discovered, to her \\"amazement\\" that \\"if you register your details under the 'minor ailments scheme', all medicines etc for children are free\\". She added: \\"They are not allowed to advertise it, but you can save a small fortune on Calpol, Piriton, Sudocrem, plasters etc. I wish I had known eight years ago!\\" So, is it true? For a start, pharmacists would not prescribe Calpol. In some areas, they might give you the generic, unbranded equivalent, which is much cheaper and therefore less costly to the NHS. Plasters are not on the list of hand-outs either. Dressings for minor burns perhaps - but not children's plasters. So let's rewind a little. What help can pharmacists offer when it comes to common health problems? The \\"minor ailments scheme\\" provides the answer. It has been around for about 10 years in some local pharmacies. It is aimed at those who can't afford to pay for certain medicines or who can't access their GP easily. The idea is that local pharmacists take some of the pressure off busy GPs and packed A&E departments, by offering over-the-counter advice and consultations. This is particularly useful when GP practices are closed, in the evenings and at weekends, when pharmacies are often open. The scheme should enable people to get treatment or advice more quickly and more easily. The type of ailments they can treat may include coughs, colds, headaches, hay fever, insect bites and stings, eczema, earache and diarrhoea. So if you have a child with a high temperature on a Saturday afternoon (when else?), you can visit your local pharmacist to seek advice. The pharmacist will need to see the child, of course, and will then decide if prescribing a medicine is necessary. If you're elderly and worried about what you can safely take for a cold with other prescription medicines, then your pharmacist should also be the first port of call. The rules on paying for what's prescribed are not always straightforward. In general, if you don't pay for prescriptions - and children under 16 and adults over 60 don't - you will probably receive them free of charge, on the NHS, just as you would from a GP. If you normally pay a prescription charge, then you will be charged for this service too. But this doesn't apply to all minor ailment schemes, because they are not all the same across the country. In Scotland, all community pharmacies run the scheme, but in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the scheme is run by the NHS locally, so it won't be available everywhere. Some areas only provide the service free to parents who receive low-income related benefits. Other NHS areas may not fund dressings or provide anything for children who present with coughs and colds. To find out what your local scheme offers, it is advisable to contact your nearest pharmacy and ask. Neal Patel, from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says people shouldn't get carried away. \\"You can't just walk into a pharmacy and stock up on Calpol for your kids. That's not the way it works.\\" Pharmacists, he says, have to make sure the treatment is appropriate, following a consultation similar to one carried out by a GP. If pharmacists aren't sure what they are dealing with or if a patient has a more serious concern, they will be referred to their GP. Ash Soni, a pharmacist in Streatham, south London, who runs the scheme in his pharmacy, said he often acts as kind of patient filter for GPs. \\"It's an opportunity for people to just walk in on the day and see a pharmacist for advice, rather than waiting for a GP appointment.\\" But he isn't there to hand out medicines, he explains. \\"You'll get it only if you need it.\\" In case the public is unsure what the minor ailment service is, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) has produced an animated video to explain more. The NHS Choices website has more information on common problems your pharmacist can help with and a way of searching for pharmacies in your local area to find out if they offer the service. The minor ailments scheme is clearly not widely known about because these web pages have experienced a massive rise in hits in the past week or so. NHS Choices told the BBC that the search term \\"minor ailments scheme\\" went from being outside the top 10,000 to the fifth most popular in the space of a few days. And research suggests the scheme, if rolled out nationally, could save the NHS in the region of Â£1bn. This is because the cost of a consultation with a GP is nearly three times higher than the cost of a consultation with a community pharmacist. So as long as the scheme is not abused and we use the pharmacists' service responsibly, the permanently cash-strapped NHS should benefit in the long run. Summary:","output":"The \\"minor ailments scheme\\" is a service offered in some local pharmacies, aimed at those who are struggling to afford certain medications or have trouble accessing their doctor. By offering consultations and over-the-counter advice, pharmacists are able to alleviate pressure on GPs and emergency departments. The scheme is not available in all areas, with its implementation varying across Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Local pharmacies are the best point of contact to find out about what minor ailment schemes are accessible in a particular region. Pharmacists are able to provide consultation to those needing treatment or advice quickly and easily for ailments that include colds, coughs, bug bites, headaches, and eczema. However, it is important to remember that the pharmacists will only supply medication if deemed necessary after a consultation. Overall, if used responsibly, the minor ailments scheme could save the National Health Service a significant amount of money in the long term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Light-emitting diode Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor.

According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.  answer the following question:  Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580? A:","output":"A: The kingdom whose king was baptized in 580 is Alodia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces  ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

Plot title: I.Q. Movie plot: During the film opening, we see a man, presumably Einstein (Walter Mathau) playing a violin, as another man walks past a poster advertising Boyd's comet. We then see Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) with her fiance James Moreland (Stephen Fry). She's working on some math referring to the comet. He comments that she's babbling when she tries to tell him a story. The scene cuts back and forth with a group of elderly men arguing about whether time exists. Meg and James are in his convertible when it develops engine trouble. We see Einstein discussing with his friends (the elderly men), whether there are 'accidents' and he says, \\"I do not believe God plays dice with the universe.\\"Catherine and James pull into a garage, where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is arguing with his boss, Bob (Tony Shalhoub), about the car they hear coming into the shop, what make and model it is and what the trouble with it is, based on what they can hear. Bob sends out Ed to check because he sees the couple and assumes they're \\"college people\\" meaning they come from Princeton College. As soon as Ed sees Catherine, he falls for her.James, obnoxiously asks if someone there can work on a British engine, and Ed says, \\"May I look under the bonnet?\\" James, reassured by the use of the word 'bonnet' consents. Ed looks at it, looks at Catherie and pronounces, \\"You have no spark.\\" There's clearly a double meaning here, referring to her relationship with James. James insists, \\"But what's wrong with it?\\" and Ed adds, \\"My guess is that you have a short stroke and premature ignition.\\" He turns to Meg Ryan and says, \\"Does it ever feel that way?\\" She replies, \\"I'm sure I don't know what you mean\\" but it's clear that she gets the double entendre.

PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\".  Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without.

A study of 14,000 women concluded that those who drink in moderation were far more likely to reach 70 in good health than heavier drinkers or abstainers. Spreading consumption over the week is better than saving it for the weekend, the researchers say. Women who drank little and often fared better than occasional drinkers. Compared with non-drinkers, women in their mid-50s who drank 15-30g of alcohol (one to two drinks) a day had a 28% greater likelihood of achieving what the US researchers call \\"successful ageing\\", meaning good general health free of conditions like cancer, diabetes and heart disease in their 70s and beyond. And women who drank on 5-7 days of the week had almost double the chance of good overall health in old age compared with complete abstainers. Experts are not sure whether it is the alcohol itself that is conferring the benefit or whether it simply goes hand in hand with other things in the lives of the women that makes them healthier. The Harvard School of Public Health researchers said they tried to control for factors like smoking that might have affected the results. Other studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption - no more than the recommended two to three units a day for women in the UK - is linked with a lower risk of heart disease and some other health conditions. And research has shown alcohol can have a positive impact in the body, reducing insulin resistance, inflammation, high cholesterol and other harmful processes. However, drinking has been linked to other conditions, such as breast cancer. Experts welcomed the findings, saying they supported current recommendations concerning alcohol limits. Natasha Stewart of the British Heart Foundation said: \\"Moderate amounts of alcohol may offer some protection against heart disease, especially for women who have gone through the menopause, but it's very important not to go overboard. \\"Drinking too much doesn't offer any heart health protection at all and may actually lead to heart muscle damage, stroke and high blood pressure. And if you don't already drink alcohol, there is certainly no need to start now. \\"Clearly there are much better ways to look after your heart than drinking alcohol, like eating a healthy, balanced diet, getting active and by not smoking.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"This is about a study that looked at how drinking alcohol affects women's health as they get older. The study found that women who had a little bit of alcohol, like one or two drinks a day, were more likely to be in good health at age 70 and beyond than women who didn't drink at all or drank too much. It's better to drink a little bit every day rather than drinking a lot on the weekends. Researchers are not sure if it's the alcohol itself that makes the women healthier or if it's other things in their lives.

Both Time and Vulture highly recommend you check out Thank the Academy, an addictive website from grad student Rebecca Rolfe, who analyzed 207 acceptance speeches from actors and directors in order to come up with pretty much everything you could ever want to know about thank-you speech trends. Highlights: Average speech length has skyrocketed to nearly two minutes. It used to be just 44 seconds for men, 39 seconds for women. And the speeches given with notes are longer (2 minutes, 2 seconds on average) than those given without (1 minute, 23 seconds on average). Just 3% of directors cry while accepting their awards, while 21% of actors do. The trend started recently, with 71% of the tears happening since 1995. As for what to do with the statuette while you're busy talking, 26% of men hoist it over their heads and 47% of women clutch it with both hands. Just one person, Jack Palance, laid his on the podium while speaking. And as for who to thank, 61% thank production reps; 48% thank family; and 40% thank the Academy. The most-thanked person (other than God) is Harvey Weinstein, who has a dozen thank-yous to his name. Find out much, much more at Rolfe's website.

What if I told you that there's this super-fun website to check out? Both Time and Vulture (those are big, important magazines) say you should! The website is called Thank the Academy, and it's really cool. A smart lady named Rebecca Rolfe, who is a grad student (that means she's studying a lot at school), made it. What she did was look at 207 speeches that actors and directors made when they won their Oscars. She wanted to find out lots and lots about the speeches they gave when saying thank-you.  Wow! She came up with a bunch of fun facts. The average length of these speeches is almost two minutes now. Before, they used to be only 44 seconds for men and 39 seconds for women. That's like the time it takes to brush your teeth!  She also found out that speeches where people read from notes are longer (about 2 minutes and 2 seconds) than those where people speak without notes (about 1 minute and 23 seconds). So, using notes is like someone telling a longer bedtime story! Another neat thing Rebecca noticed was that only 3% of directors cry when they get their awards, while 21% of actors do. And a lot of these crying moments started around 1995. If that statuette (that's the name for the Oscar award) gets heavy while they're talking, 26% of men lift it over their heads and almost half the women hold it with both their hands. Only one person, Jack Palance, ever put his statuette on the table while he spoke. And guess who people thank the most in their speeches? Well, other than thanking God, they often thank a man named Harvey Weinstein, as well as people who helped make the movie (that's 61% of the time), their family (48% of the time), and the Academy (40% of the time).

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...  Guess a valid title for it!

Movie title: Little Children Context: Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a 30-year-old, stay-at-home mother in a small Massachusetts suburban community. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but once she married Richard (Gregg Edelman) and had their daughter, the presently five-year-old Lucy (Sadie Goldstein), she set aside her research. Now she spends her days taking Lucy to a local park along with three other stay at-home mothers: the severe and judgmental Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) and more timid Theresa (Trini Alvorado) and Cheryl (Marsha Dietlein). They enjoy ogling from a distance Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), the handsome and well built father who brings his son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. When their children use the same swing set, Sarah and Brad have an opportunity to talk to one another, titillating the other women. But when they, on a lark, hug and kiss, the women immediately take their children out of the park and refuse to associate with Sarah anymore.Both Brad and Sarah have unhappy home lives. Brad has yet to pass the Massachusetts state bar exam and doesn't even want to be a lawyer. However, his bossy wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), pushes him to succeed. She makes documentaries for public television for a living. They live a bit beyond their means, forcing them to accept financial support from Kathy's mother. Their sex life is non-existent because Kathy is too self-involved in her career and being a mother. When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. One night, an acquaintance, Larry (Noah Emmerich), persuades Brad, who played quarterback on his high school football team, to join his amateur football team, the Guardians.Larry is a former police officer forced to retire a few years earlier when he accidentally shot a teenager who robbed a store.

We have this equation: -10 * p = 3 * p - 91 Our goal is to find the value of 'p'. So, we need to get all the 'p' terms on one side and all the numbers on the other side. First, let's add 10 * p to both sides of the equation to move all the 'p' terms to the right side: -10 * p + 10 * p = 3 * p + 10 * p This simplifies to: 0 = 13 * p - 91 Now, we need to get rid of the 91. So, let's add 91 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 91 = 13 * p - 91 + 91 This simplifies to: 91 = 13 * p Lastly, to find the value of 'p', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 13: 91 / 13 = (13 * p) / 13 This simplifies to: 7 = p So, the answer is p = 7."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They have released two studio albums, St. Elsewhere (2006) and The Odd Couple (2008). St. Elsewhere was recorded on the Warner Music UK label, and contained their hit single \\"Crazy\\" which topped at number two on the US Hot 100, and topped the charts in the UK. It was also nominated at the 2007 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, and was platinum certified for shipping over 1,000,000 records. In early March 2008, the duo's second album, The Odd Couple, was leaked over the internet prompting the duo to push the release date up from April 8. In an interview with Entertainment Magazine, Danger Mouse said that he \\"knew it [the leak] was coming...every day, I expected to get a call saying it leaked, and eventually I got a call saying it leaked.\\" On March 18, 2008, the album became available via download on the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3. Hard copies of the album were released on March 25.  Prior to its official release, Green spoke to the album's anti-formulaic qualities, noting bluntly that \\"there's no formula to it,\\" and that to expect the same wild success of St. Elsewhere is to neglect the ever-present \\"risk factor in any artistic endeavor.\\" He called it something of an \\"act of faith\\" - a true, earnest attempt to create and disseminate a piece of art to those who would seek out its conception.

For starters, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series. First of all, the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie film, which is always appreciated. However, there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot. Apart from that, I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. That is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, only-thinking-about-sex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. Also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects. Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. So, in the end, a generally horrid film, if seen from a critical point of view. If seen from a teen point of view, I guess that it's better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.

Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment  is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Ever since she was a little girl, Elena had been mesmerized by the intricacies of light and shadows, colors and textures, and the emotions that a single photograph could convey. It was this driving passion that led her to pursue a career in photography, and she never looked back. Christine, on the other hand, was a contemporary dancer. Her graceful movements and fluidity had won over many hearts and earned her both critical acclaim and a steadily growing fan base. A true artist, Christine was constantly searching for new ways to express herself, always pushing her own boundaries and seeking out new creative outlets. Somehow, their paths had crossed, and it was as if their talents were destined to intertwine. Elena met Christine at a small art exhibition where Christine was performing an experimental dance piece. Enamored by the dancer's ability to convey so much through movement, Elena could see the possibilities of showcasing Christine's unique movements and expressions through her photography. After the performance, Elena wasted no time in approaching Christine, eager to propose the idea of collaborating on a project that would blend their artistic visions. The excitement shared between the two as they discussed the potential of their collaboration was tangible. Their idea was to create a series of photographs that would capture the essence of Christine's dance movements, portraying the elegance and power of the human form in motion. They imagined a collection that would push the boundaries of conventional dance photography, highlighting the dancer's poetic expressions through the lens of Elena's keen artistic eye. As the project commenced, the two worked tirelessly on the concept, scouting the most visually striking locations to serve as the perfect backdrops to Christine's performance. They visited abandoned warehouses, lushly overgrown gardens, stark industrial settings, and even serene lakeshores to capture the desired atmosphere for their innovative collection. On one particularly memorable shoot, Elena and Christine ventured to a secluded ancient ruin – a beautifully haunting place that had caught the photographer's eye months ago. Elena envisioned the crumbling walls and moss-covered stones to perfectly compliment Christine's fluid movements, offering a stark contrast between the power of nature and the delicacy of the human spirit.  The day was filled with excitement, laughs, and an endless stream of creative energy. As Christine danced across the overgrown terrain, the sunlight filtered through the ruins, casting a near-mystical glow over her. With each click of the shutter, Elena captured stunning images that were both evocative and enchanting, illustrating the harmony between movement and stillness. The partnership between photographer and dancer forged something truly magical, elevating their individual art forms to even higher realms. Over time, their collaboration evolved, each shoot further pushing their creativity and resulting in a series of breathtaking images. The bond between the two grew stronger, their mutual respect for each other's craft forming a connection that transcended their professional partnership. And with each photograph that Elena captured of Christine, their shared vision culminated in a work of art that was both powerful and deeply personal. The resulting collection of photographs garnered widespread praise from critics and enthusiasts alike. Exhibitions showcased their work, highlighting the arresting beauty of Christine's dance, enriched by the captivating talent of Elena's photography. As their success grew, so did a new-found friendship, an unbreakable bond that would continue to shape their artistic journeys as they ventured forward into the world hand in hand. But success, as remarkable as it was, was not their primary accomplishment. Rather, it was the lasting impact they had left on one another and the countless individuals who had been touched by their unique partnership, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and beyond. And all of this had sprung from a single moment when Elena took great photos with a camera of Christine — igniting an artistic collaboration that would reverberate and inspire generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who used instruments of the continuo group as independent parts?  Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns. The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes: The overall degree of mastery by which these early...

Add 13*z to both sides of the equation to isolate the 'z' terms: -13*z + 244 + 13*z = 48*z + 13*z This simplifies to: 244 = 61*z Step 2: Solve for z Now, to find the value of 'z', you will need to isolate 'z' by dividing both sides of the equation by 61: 244 / 61 = 61*z / 61 This simplifies to: 4 = z So the solution for the equation -13*z + 244 = 48*z is z = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roberta Adams skipped the thick how-to guide on child-custody forms and sat down at a computer at the Lamoreaux Justice Center in Orange on Wednesday. The Garden Grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court. \\"It's easy,\\" said Adams, 25. \\"I thought I'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms home.\\" A University of California, Irvine, study released Wednesday found an interactive computer system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining orders, eviction defense, small-claims cases and requests for filing-fee waivers. Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found. Since the program started in 2000, more than 6,000 people have used the free system, located in public buildings throughout Orange County. The system was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County with about 800,000 in grants. The program avoids legal jargon, offers a courthouse video tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary. Users can choose English, Spanish or Vietnamese. Kiosks are in courthouses in Fullerton and Orange, the district attorney's family-support office, the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, Irvine City Hall and the San Juan Capistrano Library. The program is also available online. Bob Cohen, executive director of Legal Aid, said the study should clear the way for expansion throughout California. Locally, a program for divorce petitions will be added this summer. Cohen said the system proves the benefit of technology tailored to those who aren't computer-savvy. He said much of the technology now available requires Internet skills and access. Low-income people, however, have less access to computers and less experience using them. \\"Our clients have to catch up, and they have to become a part of the mainstream,\\" Cohen said.

I can use this background: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat.  Now, I have a new situation: Customers bought two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B. They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit.  Answer this question please: Which type of oven had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires? A:","output":"Type A ovens had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires. This is because customers reported that only type B ovens started experiencing short circuits.  Short circuits occur when the normal path of electrical current flow is altered, causing a drastic reduction in resistance. This situation allows for a large amount of current to pass through the circuit, which can lead to overheating, damage to connected components, and potentially fires. In the given scenario, type A ovens did not exhibit these short circuit issues, indicating that their electrical components and wiring remained intact and designed resistance values were maintained. Hence, type A ovens did not experience the adverse effects of short circuits, such as increased current flow and potential hazards, as compared to type B ovens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are near the equator or near the poles ):  Areas near the equator are warmer than areas near the poles because they receive more direct sunlight.   Sandra wants to go on vacation, and would like to go somewhere warm. Sandra will likely choose a place near the equator or near the poles? Answer:","output":"Sandra will likely choose a place near the equator for her vacation.  The passage clearly states that areas near the equator are warmer than areas near the poles as they receive more direct sunlight. As Sandra desires a warm vacation destination, it makes more sense for her to pick a location near the equator, where she can enjoy a warmer climate due to the increased direct sunlight. Equatorial regions generally have higher temperatures, and their climate is characterized by consistently high heat, with minimal variations in temperature throughout the seasons. The sun is most intense in these regions, as the rays strike the surface at a perpendicular angle, almost for the entire year. On the other hand, regions near the poles receive indirect sunlight, causing lower temperatures and harsher environments. The sunlight strikes the Earth at a low angle near the poles, resulting in the absorption of lesser solar energy and hence cooler temperatures. With this information in mind, Sandra's preference for a warm location for her vacation naturally points her in the direction of choosing a place near the equator. This could include tropical destinations, beach resorts, or even exotic rainforests, all of which fall within the warmer, equatorial regions of our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"I have no joke for this, but may I be the first to weigh in with 'Dana Plato's Retreat?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\"?","output":"If we analyze the given premise: \\"I have no joke for this, but may I be the first to weigh in with 'Dana Plato's Retreat?'\\" and the hypothesis \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\", we can observe that the premise and hypothesis are not directly related, but the premise does provide indirect evidence for assessing the truth of the hypothesis.  In order to fully understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let's first break down the premise into its components: 1. \\"I have no joke for this\\" - The speaker acknowledges that they don't have a humorous remark to make in the given context. 2. \\"May I be the first to weigh in with 'Dana Plato's Retreat?\\" - The speaker wishes to introduce the topic of 'Dana Plato's Retreat' in the current discussion. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\" - The speaker claims they do not want to engage in conversation about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.' To assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we can infer the following: The premise demonstrates that the speaker is interested in discussing 'Dana Plato's Retreat' to some extent, as they wish to be the first to mention it. The use of the phrase \\"weigh in\\" implies that the speaker wants to contribute to the conversation on the topic. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which states the speaker would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.' While the premise doesn't offer definitive proof to support or refute the hypothesis, it does provide enough information to suggest that the hypothesis is likely false. Since the speaker willingly introduces 'Dana Plato's Retreat' into the conversation in the premise, it's reasonable to infer that the speaker is actually interested in discussing the topic, contrary to the claim made in the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it's reasonable to assume that the hypothesis \\"I would not like to talk about 'Dana Plato's Retreat.\\" is likely false. The premise demonstrates that the speaker is interested in discussing 'Dana Plato's Retreat' and actively wishes to contribute to the conversation on the topic.

Troy Davis, who is set to be executed by lethal injection tomorrow night, has lost a bid for clemency launched by his defence lawyers who said he was wrongly convicted of killing a police officer. Georgia's board of pardons rejected the last-minute plea even after it attracted high-profile support, and his execution will go ahead as planned. It was the last hope for the 42-year-old, who was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. Anti-death penalty activists, who also claim Davis was wrongly convicted, chanted and held banners through Atlanta last week. It is the fourth time in four years his execution has been scheduled by Georgia officials. Scroll down for video. Conviction: Troy Davis, left, is set to be executed by lethal injection on Wednesday after he was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, right, who was shot dead in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. Peace: Police officer Mark MacPhail MacPhail's mother Anneliese MacPhail remains convinced Davis is guilty. Steve Hayes, spokesman for the Board. of Pardons and Paroles, said the panel decided to rejected Davis' request for clemency after hearing hours of testimony from his. supporters and prosecutors. Troy Davis was convicted of the August 19, 1989, murder of Georgia police officer Mark MacPhail, who was working as a security guard at a Burger King when he intervened in an argument between several men in a nearby parking lot. He was shot in the heart and face without having drawn his gun. One of the men, Sylvester Coles, went to police and implicated Davis in the killing, and he was arrested four days later. During Davis’ 1991 trial, many witnesses testified they had seen Davis shoot MacPhail. Two others testified that Davis had confessed the murder to them. The murder weapon was never found, and no physical evidence linked Davis to the crime. Throughout his trial and subsequent appeals, Davis has maintained his innocence but was sentenced to death in August 1991. Seven of nine witnesses to the. murder changed or. recanted their testimony in recent years. Several stated they had felt pressure by police to implicate Davis. New witnesses implicated Coles in the crime. Many appeals in state and federal courts followed. Davis and his lawyers argued that the racial composition of the jury and poor advocacy from his lawyers had affected his right to a fair trial. In an August 2010 decision, the conviction was upheld, with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia declaring that the new evidence cast only 'minimal doubt on his conviction'. Subsequent appeals, including to the Supreme Court, were rejected. In July 2007, September 2008, and October 2008, execution dates were scheduled but stayed shortly before the events took place. The decision appeared to leave Davis. with little chance of avoiding the execution date. Defence attorney. Jason Ewart has said that the pardons board was likely Davis' last. option. His lawyers have long argued Davis. was a victim of mistaken identity. But prosecutors say they have no. doubt that they charged the right person with the crime. MacPhail's relatives said they were relieved by the decision. 'That's what we wanted, and that's. what we got,' said Anneliese MacPhail, the victim's mother. 'We wanted. to get it over with, and for him to get his punishment.' 'Justice was finally served for my father,' said Mark MacPhail Jr, who. was an infant when his father was gunned down. 'The truth was finally. heard.' Kim Davis, the inmate's sister, declined immediate comment on the decision. Amnesty International USA director Larry Cox said in a statement that the decision was 'unconscionable'. 'Should Troy Davis be executed,. Georgia may well have executed an innocent man and in so doing. discredited the justice system,' Mr Cox said.- but Mr MacPhail’s mother. Anneliese remains convinced Davis is guilty. She said the upcoming execution of her son's 'killer' will bring her peace. ‘I will never have closure,’ Ms MacPhail told CNN. ‘But I may have some peace when he is executed.’ The case has captured international attention because of concerns about the quality of evidence involved in Davis’s conviction - but Ms MacPhail said she has ‘never had any doubts’ it was him. ‘I think these people are just against the death penalty,’ she told CNN, of the many protesters who claim to be worried the state will put an innocent man to death. ‘They don't know what happened.’ Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles is expected to meet on Monday to consider whether to stop Davis' execution by lethal injection, which is scheduled for next Wednesday. Marching army: Thousands gathered in Atlanta, Georgia, to protest the pending execution on Wednesday of Troy Davis, who they say was wrongly convicted of killing a Savannah police officer in 1989. Crowds: Thousands gathered in downtown Atlanta to protest the pending execution on Wednesday. ‘I pray that this rally will have an. impact on Pardons and Paroles,’ said marcher Solana Plaines, of. Savannah, Georgia. ‘I hope they will do the right thing.’ Davis declined to order a special last. meal. He will be served what's on the menu at the Georgia state prison. in Jackson before his execution on Wednesday - grilled cheeseburger,. oven-browned potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw, cookies and a grape. beverage. Davis's supporters say there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime and that key witnesses in his trial have since recanted their testimony. ‘You just can't give up hope,’ said Ellen Kubica, who travelled all the way from her home in Germany to attend Friday's event, which featured banners reading: ‘Too much doubt to execute.’ Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march. Reverend Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and television show host, also attended. Anger: Reverend Al Sharpton speaks to a standing-room only crowd during a prayer service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, in support of death row inmate Troy Davis. Megaphone: Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march. ‘The only thing left to decide is whether you have the courage to do the right thing,’ he said of the parole board. ‘It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row.’ 'The only thing left to decide is whether you have the courage to do the right thing. It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row' Reverend Al Sharpton. In a rare move, the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2009 ordered a new hearing for Davis to assess what he said was new evidence showing his innocence. The justices transferred the case to a U.S. District Court in Georgia for a hearing and determination of his claims that new witnesses will clearly establish his innocence. A year later, the judge, William T. Moore Jr, rejected Davis' claims of innocence. But on Thursday, supporters of Davis delivered petitions with more than 600,000 names to the parole board. New York: Demonstrators gather near Times Square in Manhattan to protest the execution of Davis on Friday. Message: A woman holds a sign at a protest outside President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters in Chicago, one of 300 rallies held worldwide on Friday, ahead of a last-ditch parole board hearing for Davis. In a column last week in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, former FBI Director William Sessions called for Davis's sentence to be commuted to life in prison, saying the case was 'permeated in doubt'. However in an opposing column written in late 2008 and republished on Thursday, Spencer Lawton, the district attorney who prosecuted Davis, said the condemned man had a fair trial. The claim that seven witnesses at the trial had subsequently recanted their testimony was ‘not believable’, Lawton wrote - and he denied any witnesses had been coerced by police. See video here.

Analyzing the information given in the premise, we can break it down into the following components: 1. \\"He had to\\": This statement implies that there was a certain obligation or necessity for someone (referred to as \\"he\\") to perform a specific action or task. The nature of the action or task is not specified, but the emphasis is on the requirement or compulsory nature of the act. 2. \\"said the Kal\\": This part of the sentence tells us that the individual or entity named \\"the Kal\\" is the one who expressed the statement or idea mentioned in the first part (\\"He had to\\"). This means that the Kal is the source or originator of the statement, reinforcing the notion that \\"he\\" (the subject) must perform the task. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: \\"The Kal said that it was necessary for him to.\\" 1. \\"The Kal said\\": This portion of the hypothesis establishes that the Kal is the one who made a declaration or assertion about something. It matches the second component of the premise, indicating that the Kal is the one providing the information. 2. \\"that it was necessary for him to\\": This part of the hypothesis summarizes the content of the Kal's statement. The phrase \\"it was necessary\\" aligns closely with the idea inside the initial part of the premise: \\"He had to.\\" Furthermore, \\"for him to\\" designates that the necessity discussed in the statement is related specifically to the person referred to as \\"he,\\" which is consistent with our understanding of the premise. Based on this detailed analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"The Kal said that it was necessary for him to.\\" accurately reflects the information and meaning present in the given premise, \\"He had to, said the Kal.\\" As a result, we can consider the hypothesis to be true within the context of this premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - Sukarno (6 June 1901  21 June 1970) was the first President of Indonesia, serving in office from 1945 to 1967.  - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs. It was established in 1947 and is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International Organization Foundation. The editor-in-chief is Jon Pevehouse (University of WisconsinMadison).  - An ambassador is an official envoy, especially a highest ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state, or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor. An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy, whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a chargé d'affaires in place of an ambassador.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The President of the Republic of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Indonesia. The President leads the executive branch of the Indonesian government and is the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces.  - Belgians are the citizens and natives of the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe.  - A chargé d'affaires, often shortened to chargé (French) and sometimes to charge-D (abbreviated in colloquial English), is a diplomat who heads an embassy in the absence of the ambassador. The term is French for \\"charged with (in charge of) matters\\". A female diplomat may be designated a chargée d'affaires, following French declension.  - The Maluku Islands or the Moluccas are an archipelago within Indonesia. Tectonically they are located on the Halmahera Plate within the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. Geographically they are located east of Sulawesi, west of New Guinea, and north and east of Timor. The islands were also the historical core of the Spice Islands known to the Chinese and Europeans, but this term usually included other adjacent areas such as Sulawesi. The name was due to the nutmeg, mace and cloves that were originally exclusively found there, and the presence of these sparked colonial interest from Europe in the 16th century.  - Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati (new spelling: Cokorda Gde Raka Sukawati), (January 15, 1899 in Ubud, Gianyar, Bali  1967) was the only President of the State of East Indonesia from 1946 to its disestablishment in 1950. His title Tjokorda Gde indicates that Soekawati belonged to the highest ksatria (one of the four noble castes in Bali). He had a Balinese wife Gusti Agung Niang Putu of which a son was born Tjokorda Ngurah Wim Sukawati. In 1933 Tjokorda Raka married a French woman named Gilberte Vincent with whom he had two sons.  - The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 is an international treaty that defines a framework for diplomatic relations between independent countries. It specifies the privileges of a diplomatic mission that enable diplomats to perform their function without fear of coercion or harassment by the host country. This forms the legal basis for diplomatic immunity. Its articles are considered a cornerstone of modern international relations. As of April 2014, it has been ratified by 190 states.  - Raja (also spelled Rajah, from Sanskrit  '), is a title for a Monarch or princely ruler in South and Southeast Asia.

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \\"the throne\\" or \\"the crown\\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication.   - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.  - Diplomatic immunity is a form of legal immunity that ensures diplomats are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to lawsuit or prosecution under the host country's laws, although they can still be expelled. Modern diplomatic immunity was codified as international law in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) which has been ratified by all but a handful of nations, though the concept and custom of such immunity have a much longer history dating back thousands of years. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be customary law. Diplomatic immunity as an institution developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and armed conflict. When receiving diplomats, who formally represent the sovereign, the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these are provided on a reciprocal basis.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   38.4 Muscle Contraction and Locomotion The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeleton muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitation–contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much force the whole muscle produces.   Q: The body contains how many types of muscle tissue?   A:  (a). two. (b). seven. (c). four. (d). three. The answer is:","output":"(d). three. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the paragraph.

Sentence 1 states that there are typically three courses, along with wine, offered at a set price. This implies that when a customer orders or pays for this set-priced meal, they will receive three courses accompanied by wine. Sentence 2 reiterates the same concept, but with a slight variation in the phrasing. It says that wine is generally part of a three-course meal at a set price. This statement further establishes the relationship between the set-priced meal and the serving of wine as a component of the meal.

The shared electrons then belong to both atoms equally, allowing them to complete their outer shells without actually losing or gaining electrons. This sharing of electrons results in the formation of molecules, and the bond between the atoms is known as a covalent bond."},{"instruction":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who quits the band when Stevenson urges them to go on tour?  The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion. Aukerman leaves the band again to attend graduate school.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: How do I get rid of annoying girls? Dealing with annoying people, in this case, girls, can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies you can employ to handle the situation. Firstly, remember that what might be annoying to you might not be a big problem for others. Here are some tactics to consider: 1. Communicate: Have an honest conversation with the person(s) involved, expressing your feelings and concerns. Use \\"I\\" statements to express how their behavior affects you without putting them on the defensive. 2. Set boundaries: Establish personal space and time limits to protect your well-being. Politely but firmly express your need for privacy and personal space. 3. Stay calm: Keep your emotions under control when dealing with the annoying person. Stooping to their level or getting angry can only escalate the situation. 4. Distance yourself: If the person continues to be annoying, limit your interaction with them. Try to avoid social situations where you will have contact with them. 5. Focus on yourself: Sometimes, our own emotional state can play a part in our perception of others. Make sure you're taking care of your own mental health and not projecting any personal issues onto others. 6. Seek help: If the situation escalates or causes emotional distress and all other methods have been exhausted, consider talking to a counselor, teacher, or someone else who can provide guidance. Question 2: What is the best way to get rid of an annoying company? It is unclear from the question whether you're referring to a company in the legal entity sense or a group of people. However, I'll provide a response for both situations. Annoying company as a legal entity: If you are dealing with an annoying company, you can employ different tactics to deal with the situation: 1. Terminate the business relationship: If you're a customer or client of the company, you can choose to stop doing business with them and seek alternatives. Make sure to communicate your reasons for terminating the relationship so they can learn and potentially improve. 2. Voice your concerns: Contact the company's customer service department or, if possible, its owner or management to express your concerns. Often, businesses are responsive to customer feedback and will take steps to remedy the situation. 3. Use social media: Share your experience through social media platforms or leave reviews on websites such as Yelp, Google Reviews, or Trustpilot. Publicly expressing your concerns can encourage the company to take action directly. 4. Report the company: If their behavior or practices violate any laws or business regulations, you can report the company to the appropriate local authorities, such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or relevant regulatory agencies. Annoying company as a group of people: If you are referring to a group of people that accompany you, you can follow some of the strategies similar to dealing with annoying girls mentioned earlier. This includes communicating clearly, setting boundaries, distancing yourself, and seeking help if necessary. Regarding the question of whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, they are not directly asking the same thing. The questions are contextually different, as Question 1 refers to individual interactions with annoying girls, while Question 2 focuses on either dealing with an annoying legal entity or a group of people. However, similar strategies can be applied in both cases, such as communication, setting boundaries, and seeking help when needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

POLICE: EX-STUDENT WHO FATHERED SON WITH TEACHER KILLED BOTH The next time police intercepted Johnson, they were arresting him and charging him with first-degree murder in McCauley’s death. Authorities linked Johnson to McCauley after he allegedly robbed another CVS on Monday while in possession of her car. ARKANSAS MAN ARRAIGNED IN ROAD RAGE KILLING OF 3-YEAR-OLD Late Monday, police sent out a critical missing person alert with images of McCauley, her distinctive, small, white Toyota Scion and the suspect. Not long afterward, a police report stated that officers responded to a sighting of the car and found it. When they went inside a nearby CVS, they found the suspect, who gave them the key. Police found McCauley unresponsive in the car and she was pronounced dead early Tuesday, according to the police report. Johnson’s six other charges stem from alleged thefts or robberies. He’s also wanted in two other counties for failure to show in court in other theft cases, NBC4 reported. Johnson has been ordered to undergo multiple mental health screenings and attend drug rehabilitation in past cases, however, it’s unclear if any of the screenings took place or the rehab was completed. Interim Police Chief Peter Newsham said police don't believe McCauley, 46, and Johnson knew each other, and they don't know how Johnson encountered McCauley. The last known contact with McCauley was around 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Newsham said. McCauley was expected at a large Christmas dinner that night, but host Bill Largess said Tuesday she hadn't arrived when they were ready to start. People texted and called, but got no response. McCauley had come to the dinner for the last 15 years, but they weren't too worried since she had slept through it once a few years ago. But the next morning they heard that she missed a flight to visit family on the West Coast. “That's when we knew something was definitely wrong,” Largess said.

The unlikely pair _ an itinerant hitchhiker turned Internet celebrity and a lawyer three times his age _ met amid the neon lights of Times Square and headed back to a squat brick home on a quiet New Jersey cul-de-sac, authorities say.      CORRECTS SPELLING OF LAST NAME - In this undated photo downloaded from the Union County Prosecutor’s website, Caleb “Kai’ Lawrence McGillvary is shown. McGillvary, 24, is being sought by New Jersey authorities... (Associated Press)      Days later the lawyer was found beaten to death in his bedroom, wearing only his socks and underwear. The hitchhiker was arrested Thursday and charged with his murder.      Caleb \\"Kai\\" McGillvary took a star turn in February when he became known to millions as \\"Kai the Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker\\" after intervening in an attack on a California utility worker. McGillvary described using a hatchet he was carrying to repeatedly hit a man who had struck a worker with his car, fending off a further attack.      Once lauded as a hero, McGillvary, 24, now returns to the spotlight under nefarious circumstances.      He was arrested at a Philadelphia bus station Thursday evening and charged with the murder of Joseph Galfy, Jr., a 73-year-old attorney.      \\"I believe that everyone is a little safer with this person off the streets,\\" said Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow.      McGillvary will be processed in Philadelphia and sent to back to New Jersey in the coming days, Romankow said. His bail is set at 3 million.      Galfy was found dead in his Clark, N.J., home Monday, two days after authorities said he met McGillvary in New York City. Galfy, who lived alone, was found by police who went to his home to check on his well-being, Romankow said.      Statements posted on McGillvary's Facebook page following the homicide were \\"sexual in nature,\\" Romankow said.      McGillvary's last post, dated Tuesday, asks \\"what would you do?\\" if you awoke in a stranger's house and found you'd been drugged and sexually assaulted. One commenter suggests hitting him with a hatchet _ and McGillvary's final comment on the post says, \\"I like your idea.\\"      It was a hatchet that helped give McGillvary a brief taste of fame in February when he gave a rambling, profanity-laced 5-minute interview to a Fresno, Calif., television station about thwarting an unprovoked attack on a Pacific Gas & Electric employee. The interview went viral, with one version viewed more than 3.9 million times on YouTube. McGillvary later traveled to Los Angeles to appear on ABC's \\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\\"      Kimmel asked him what people were saying to him since the Feb. 1 incident. \\"Hey, you're Kai, that dude with the hatchet,\\" he responded.      Romankow declined to say what object was used in Galfy's beating.      Romankow said McGillvary, who said in his TV appearance he prefers to be called \\"home-free\\" instead of homeless, traded on his fledgling celebrity to meet fans across the country.      Authorities know he was in Times Square based on witness accounts, the prosecutor said.      \\"He was well-known,\\" Romankow said.      McGillvary spent at least two nights in Galfy's home in Clark, 20 miles west of New York, Romankow said. The dark brick home is neatly landscaped, with carefully-pruned bushes lining a path to the entrance. Red tape labeled \\"evidence\\" is affixed to the front door.      Authorities believe McGillvary took two trips to meet a fan in Asbury Park; Galfy picked him up after the first trip and brought him back to Clark, Romankow said.      It is unclear how McGillvary got to the train station a second time. After heading back to Asbury Park, McGillvary and the fan went to Philadelphia, then to Glassboro in southern New Jersey, where McGillvary spent Monday night.      Tuesday he boarded a train in New Jersey bound for Philadelphia, Romankow said.      McGillvary swiftly gained notoriety after he was interviewed in February.      McGillvary told KMPH, the Fox affiliate in Fresno, that he was traveling with a man, now facing charges including attempted murder, who veered into the worker.      After the driver got out of the car, he walked up to the utility worker and allegedly said, \\"I am Jesus and I am here to take you home.\\" McGillvary pulled a hatchet from his backpack and struck the driver in the head several times to subdue him, The Fresno Bee reported.      \\"That woman was in danger,\\" McGillvary told KMPH, the Fox affiliate in Fresno. \\"He just finished, what looked like at the time, killing somebody, and if he hadn't done that he would have killed more people.\\"      Last month, the driver entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, the newspaper reported.      McGillvary also told the television station that he once came upon a man \\"beating on this woman he calls his\\" in an orchard and intervened.      \\"I started smashing him in the head and the teeth,\\" McGillvary said.      In a Facebook post from May 10, written from a mobile phone, McGillvary thanked the people who \\"invited me in, partied hardy with me,\\" and kept him grounded even though he realized how \\"crazy fame can be in flippin ones life upside down. \\"      \\"ive met some of the greatest people in my life in these last three months,\\" he wrote, \\"and i wouldnt trade these experiences with you for all the money in hollywood.\\" ||||| Kai the hitchhiker, who captivated the Internet in February with an act of heroism and a contagiously entertaining local TV interview, is now a murder suspect in New Jersey.      Union County law enforcement has issued an arrest warrant for him for the murder of Joseph Galfy, Jr., in Clark, N.J., according to the Union County Prosecutor's Office.      Galfy was reportedly found dead inside his home on May 13. The cause of death has been declared as blunt force trauma. Authorities say Kai — identified by his full name, Caleb Lawrence McGillvary — is considered armed and dangerous and has cut his hair in an effort to conceal his identity. He's charged with murder and bail is set at 3 million.      SEE ALSO: Shrouded in Viral Mystery, Kai the Hitchhiker Gains a Cult Following      McGillvary, a.k.a. Kai, was passing through Fresno, Calif., in February when he saw a man attack a utility worker with a car and assault a woman at a gas station. He then hit the man on the back of the head three times with a hatchet to stop the attack, and his interview shortly thereafter became a viral sensation. Videos of him have since been viewed millions of times on YouTube and he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where Kimmel gave him a surfboard as a present.      So what could have prompted such a dark turn in McGillvary's story? While his official take is unknown, below is a cryptic status update to his Facebook page from Tuesday, the day after Galfy was found dead.      Be warned; it contains graphic, NSFW language.

Both are inquiring about strategies to increase the number of visitors, or 'traffic', to a particular website. To answer your question, there are several effective strategies to increase website traffic and attract visitors: 1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Enhance your website for search engines. This includes the strategic use of keywords in your content, optimizing your meta tags, and creating high-quality backlinks. Consider the use of long-tail keywords as they typically have a lower level of competition than common keywords.  2. Content Marketing: Publish valuable, engaging, and original content regularly. This could be blog posts, articles, infographics or videos. High quality content can attract organic traffic, boost SEO performance, and encourage repeat visitors. 3. Social Media Promotion: Use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to advertise your content. This can expose your website to a wider audience, increase brand visibility and attract more visitors. 4. Email Marketing: Send regular newsletters or promotional offers to your subscribers. This not only keeps your audience engaged but also drives them back to your site. 5. Online Advertising: Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, social media ads, and other forms of online advertising can significantly increase website traffic. 6. Guest Blogging: Writing guest posts for popular blogs in your industry can expose your brand to a larger audience. Usually, you get the opportunity to link back to your site in your author bio, which can boost traffic. 7. Influencer Marketing: Collaborate with influencers in your industry to expose your brand to their followers. This can bring in a significant amount of traffic, particularly if the influencer has a large following. 8. Website Analytics: Use tools like Google Analytics to analyze your website’s traffic. Understand which pages are the most popular, where your visitors are coming from and what they do on your site. This information can help you refine your strategies to boost traffic. 9. Website Design: Ensure your website has a user-friendly design, is easy to navigate, and has a fast loading speed. A better user experience often leads to higher dwell time, lower bounce rates, and thus, more traffic. 10. Collaborations and Partnerships: Partner with other websites, brands, or online communities in your industry for collaborations or content exchanges. This can expose your website to a larger audience and potentially increase traffic. In conclusion, obtaining more website traffic involves a combination of several strategies, and what works best can depend greatly on your specific industry, target audience, and available resources. It may take some time and experimentations to determine the best approach for your brand. Remember, quality and relevancy are key - attracting the right kind of traffic that is likely to engage with your content and opt for your products/services is more important than just increasing the overall site visits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Competing page 'Hire Lindsey Stone' was created in support of the 30-year-old, only receiving 39 Likes.","output":"Title: The Controversial Photo at Arlington National Cemetery: Lindsey Stone Caught in the Crossfire Introduction: In today's world, one wrong move on social media can ignite a whirlwind of public outrage and have far-reaching consequences. A striking example of this phenomenon is the case of Lindsey Stone, a woman who faced severe backlash over a now-infamous photo taken at the Arlington National Cemetery. Background: To understand the gravity of this situation, let's rewind to October when Lindsey Stone and her co-worker visited the sacred Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arlington National Cemetery. This site is well-known as a place of remembrance and national pride, honoring the sacrifices of countless American soldiers. The Controversial Photo: During their visit, Lindsey and her friend decided to have some fun and pose for a lighthearted photo. Little did they know, this moment would lead to a 'total lapse of judgement,' as described by Lindsey's father, Peter Stone. The photo quickly went viral, drawing public ire for its perceived disrespect to fallen service members. Immediate Aftermath: As the photo spread across the internet, a Facebook page titled 'Fire Lindsey Stone' was created, swiftly amassing over 19,000 Likes. People from all walks of life came together to condemn Lindsey for her actions at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and to demand that she be held accountable. Employment Fallout: Facing mounting pressure, Lindsey Stone and her co-worker, who had taken the photo, were both eventually fired from their jobs on Wednesday. This decision fueled further debate over whether such an extreme measure was justified or if the online outrage had gone too far. Competing Support: In response to the widespread calls for Lindsey's termination, a competing Facebook page was created called 'Hire Lindsey Stone.' This page aimed to provide support for the 30-year-old woman amidst the online firestorm. Though the page garnered a significantly smaller following with only 39 Likes, it demonstrated that there were individuals who felt the backlash had crossed the line into cyberbullying. Conclusion: The Lindsey Stone case is a powerful example of the impact social media can have on our lives. It showcases both the solidarity that can emerge in holding people accountable for their actions, and the potential for online backlash to escalate out of control. In such situations, it is crucial for society to strike a delicate balance between defending expectations of respect and refraining from perpetuating harmful cyberbullying culture."},{"instruction":"What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The lungs remove oxygen from the air - Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream - Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen - Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body - Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries.

POST : Throwaway account since my sister is on Reddit. &amp;#x200B; Some context: my sister is 27, I am 19. She married her husband, Jack, when she was 22 and I was 15. I'm not close to my sister, or Jack at all. I'd met him a handful of times and we got along fine, but I wouldn't even really say that we were friends.  &amp;#x200B; Soon after I added him as a friend on Facebook, my sister's husband Jack started liking all of my stuff on Facebook. Not just photos and statuses, but things that I was tagged in, or even if I said that I was 'interested' in an event. He even went and liked all of my old profile pictures. I would get texts from friends asking me why this man they didn't know was liking dozens of their photos and statuses at a time and I didn't know how to explain. I don't know what brought this on, considering we hardly ever interacted. I asked my brother about it and he found it strange, since he had a much closer relationship with Jack and Jack never liked any of the things my brother posted on Facebook, even though he posted more often than I did. When this started I was 16, and Jack was 24.   &amp;#x200B; The entire ordeal made me uncomfortable, but I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to tell my sister or my parents because I was worried that this might cause unnecessary tension amongst all of us. In retrospect, I should've just talked to my sister about it, but it seemed petty to say that I didn't like that her husband was just liking things on Facebook. And I was 16, I didn't know how to handle this kind of situation. So I blocked Jack, but I realized that if he ever used my sister's Facebook account that he would see that I was still active and know that I blocked him. So I blocked her too. I meant to unblock both of them after awhile to see if the problem was solved, but I forgot.  &amp;#x200B; Now fast forward to last month - nearly 3 years after all of this happened. Jack and my sister have since divorced (she found out that he had cheated on her with a coworker), and my sister discovers through my brother that I am still active on Facebook and she puts it together that I must've blocked her. After explaining the situation for the first time ever to my family, she goes ballistic and calls me a bitch for not unblocking her and telling her about Jack after they had gotten their divorce. She also takes Jack's side in the matter, saying that it was a selfish of me to find him just liking my stuff creepy. My defense was that she was already hurt by finding out Jack cheated, and had no intention of getting back with him after she found out - telling her about the liking incident would rub unnecessary salt in her wound, especially seeing as how we already barely talk to one another. I also explained that I forgot that I had blocked them, and fully intended to unblock them at one point. Needless to say she's now unblocked, but Jack's still blocked.

South Slavic dialects historically formed a continuum. The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, Shtokavian became the most widespread in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by Chakavian and Kajkavian (which further blend into Slovenian in the northwest). Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as \\"Slavic\\", \\"Illyrian\\", or according to region, \\"Bosnian\\", \\"Serbian\\" and \\"Croatian\\", the latter often in combination with \\"Slavonian\\" or \\"Dalmatian\\".  Serbo-Croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century Vienna Literary Agreement by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established. From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \\"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the ethnic names Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and sometimes Montenegrin and Bunjevac. Answer the following questions: 1.

Answer the following question: When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\\" \\"Your food?\\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \\"That's ridiculous. It's food. It belongs to whoever finds it first.\\" \\"Then you belong to us,\\" Snout hissed. \\"Because we are the rats who will suck the marrow from your broken bones.\\" Question: How long has Snout and Patch known each other? === The answer to the above question is OPTIONS:  *not enough information;  *They are old enemies;  *They recognize each other from before;  *They just crossed paths; Answer:","output":"Not enough information can be found within the provided text to accurately determine how long Snout and Patch have known each other.

Stan Vanuytrecht will have no heating, running water or pay at the Saalfelden hermitage in the Austrian Alps.      It has had a hermit for all of its 350 years and the local mayor said Mr Vanuytrecht \\"radiated calm\\".      His beard will help. His predecessor lacked both beard and cowl and lasted only one season, hinting at \\"arch-conservative Catholic\\" criticism.      'Well anchored'      Mr Vanuytrecht admitted he was surprised to be chosen.      \\"I thought I didn't have a chance,\\" he said. \\"But when I read about the Saalfelden hermitage, I thought to myself: that's the place for me.\\"      The views are great, the facilities not so.      He can't even expect to be left alone.      The hermitage season only runs from April to November - in winter it is not habitable - but many people hike up to enjoy the views and it has been known for some of them to seek counselling.      The white-bearded, pipe-wielding Mr Vanuytrecht feels he is well grounded in that, having had experience with the homeless, alcoholics, drug addicts, prisoners and psychiatric patients.      And poverty. After divorce from a partner who suffered mental illness, he \\"had to make do with very little. I was glad when I had money for food,\\" the Saalfelden visitors' website reported him as saying.

Photo: Hans Enzwieser/BIPs/Getty Images      In mid-January, a small village in the Austrian Alps briefly made international headlines. For Austrians living abroad—a demographic that includes yours truly—that’s usually not a good thing. This time, however, the news was refreshingly free of National Socialism or subterranean sex dungeons. Instead, the town of Saalfelden, in the state of Salzburg, was in need of a new hermit. The previous one had quit after just one season.      According to the job posting, Saalfelden is one of the only places in Central Europe that still has a tenanted hermitage. In the mid-17th century, a chapel and adjacent living quarters were built into a rock face overlooking the scenic Saalfelden Basin. Sitting at an elevation of roughly 3,300 feet, the space has been inhabited ever since. In recent years, the resident hermit has been expected to live in the cliffside dwelling from April until November. Applicants for the position should have “a connection to Christian beliefs” and be “at peace with themselves,” according to the posting. The aspiring hermit also shouldn’t be a total misanthrope, since the job includes conversing with visiting hikers as well as pilgrims seeking spiritual guidance. Applicants should be prepared for an ascetic existence: there’s no electricity or running water, and the position is unpaid. The Daily Mail asked, “Is this the worst job in the world?”      Not everyone seems to think so.      In fact, the initial deadline of March 15 was moved forward to the end of February due to the unanticipated number of applications.      “We were taken totally by surprise,” says Alois Moser, a local priest who, along with Saalfelden’s mayor, Erich Rohrmoser, will be choosing the next hermit. Over the phone, Moser said they were initially hoping that a brief news item on Austrian public television would yield one or two qualified candidates. Instead, the ad went viral.      Moser has since heard from people as far afield as the United States, Argentina, and Thailand. It’s hardly Powerball for international recluses—Moser said he had just over 20 applications when I spoke with him in mid-February—but the response is still unprecedented. At least four women are seeking to become Saalfelden’s first female hermit. Though they will be up against the stodgy traditionalism of the Austrian Catholic church, Moser says every applicant will be given careful consideration.      As for why so many media outlets deemed the hermit gig newsworthy (or at least clickbait worthy), Moser thinks that something about the simple, solitary life “registered with the current zeitgeist.”      Recent trends in digital detox and gung-ho individualism seem to bear this out. On the one hand, there’s the ominous rise of the doomsday prepper. On the milder end of the spectrum are the back-to-nature movements that signify a sort of low-stakes rebellion against the pervasiveness of the internet.      “It’s the yearning of our time: to escape the rat race, the incessant media, all the fear and the unrest in the world. There’s a desire to withdraw from the drama and the pace of it all,” says Brother Raimund von der Thannen, the 68-year-old Austrian Benedictine monk who was Saalfelden’s hermit from 2004 to 2015. Von der Thannen, who now lives in an abbey in the Styrian village of St. Lambrecht, believes the need to get away from it all has only increased with the rise of social media.      “There’s this horrible pressure to constantly present yourself to the world via simplistic means, be it over Twitter, or YouTube, or what do I know,” he says. “It’s a constant pressure to promote a version of yourself that’s not real. Everyone wants to come off as a world champion, but everyone’s really just a dope.”      With his reserved demeanor, prodigious beard, and cowl, von der Thannen so embodied the stereotypical religious recluse that it was a hard act to follow. His short-lived successor, a Viennese priest and psychotherapist named Thomas Fieglmüller, was chastised by conservative members of the community for not being sufficiently hermit-like in appearance. (He didn’t have a cowl or a beard.) “Maybe I was the wrong person for the job,” Fieglmüller told the Salzburger Nachrichten, though the article states that he left on good terms and plans to attend the swearing-in ceremony for the next hermit.      Asked why he decided to take up residence in Saalfelden all those years ago, von der Thannen said he was inspired by a desire to free himself from the shackles of materialism and the need for recognition. “Not having to be important is such a wonderful thing,” he says. He’d been employed at a bank, had worked as a tax adviser, and had been an instructor at a trade school. He’d had his trials, too. Divorced with two adult children, von der Thannen is a cancer survivor and former gambling addict, though he stresses that prospective hermitage occupiers need to have conquered any such demons before taking up residence—Saalfelden is not rehab center with a killer view. “You can’t be running from something,” says von der Thannen. “It has to be an unforced decision.”      This feels consistent with the line from the vacancy notice about aspiring hermits needing to be “at peace with themselves.” After all, accepting a life of solitary reflection is only one half of what the job entails. The other is being well-adjusted and empathetic enough to offer solace for those in need. The aspiring wise man on the mountain, in other words, shouldn’t only be looking out for number one.      “That’s the whole point,” says von der Thannen. “Being a hermit only to get yourself into heaven is really not enough.” ||||| There's no running water, electricity or pay but 50 people from around the world still applied to be one of Europe's last hermits. Now there is a winner, Austrian officials said Wednesday.      \\"We opted for Stan Vanuytrecht because his personality appealed to us. He radiates calm and comes across as well-anchored,\\" said Erich Rohrmoser, mayor of Saalfelden near Salzburg in the west.      Vanuytrecht, a divorced, Trabant-driving former artillery officer, surveying technician and Catholic deacon from Belgium with a white beard and a pipe, said he was surprised to be chosen.      \\"I thought I didn't have a chance,\\" the Austria Press Agency quoted the 58-year-old retiree as saying. \\"When I read about the Saalfelden hermitage I thought to myself: that's the place for me.\\" ||||| Stan Vanuytrecht chosen from 50 applicants for post, which comes with no heating, running water, internet or pay      A Belgian man has won a competition to live as a hermit in a cliffside cell above an Austrian town.

Vanuytrecht said he thought his previous experience working with homeless people, alcoholics, drug addicts, prisoners and psychiatric patients would stand him in good stead. His divorce and the poverty he experienced as a result was also good preparation, he added.      The trained surveying technician, who is also a Catholic deacon, will not be completely alone.

Christine was mean to everyone..","output":"In general, Emily's life was better than the life Christine lived since Christine was mean to everyone. This behavior had an impact on both their lives in several ways. Firstly, Emily's positive and kind attitude towards others helped her build strong relationships with those around her. People enjoyed spending time with her and appreciated her support. In contrast, Christine's mean behavior pushed others away and created a negative environment, making her feel isolated and lonely. Secondly, Emily cultivated a positive reputation at work and in her community, which led to opportunities for success. Her superiors and peers recognized her ability to collaborate effectively and stay level-headed during stressful situations, qualities they attributed to her kindness. On the other hand, Christine's inclination to be cruel and antagonistic made it difficult for her to work with others, causing her to miss out on opportunities for professional growth. Thirdly, Emily's life was filled with a sense of purpose and personal fulfillment. By treating others with respect and kindness, she found satisfaction in seeing others succeed and knowing she contributed positively to their lives. Christine, however, experienced the opposite effect as her mean-spiritedness often led her to feel disconnected from others and emotionally unfulfilled. Lastly, Emily's compassionate approach had a positive impact on her well-being. Research shows that being kind and empathetic towards others benefits one's mental and emotional health. Christine's mean behavior, on the other hand, likely caused her to experience feelings of guilt or self-dislike, which negatively impacted her well-being. In conclusion, Emily's life was better than Christine's due to the different ways they treated others. Kindness played a crucial role in Emily's life, contributing to her strong relationships, positive reputation, personal fulfillment, and overall well-being. Christine's mean behavior, however, led her down a path of isolation, missed opportunities, and poor mental health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass.

As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

CHAPTER VI: FIRKET   June 7, 1896  Since the end of 1895 the Dervish force in Firket had been under the command of the Emir Hammuda, and it was through the indolence and neglect of this dissipated Arab that the Egyptian army had been able to make good its position at Akasha without any fighting. Week after week the convoys had straggled unmolested through the difficult country between Sarras and the advanced base. No attack had been made upon the brigade at Akasha. No enterprise was directed against its communications. This fatal inactivity did not pass unnoticed by Wad Bishara, the Governor of Dongola; but although he was nominally in supreme command of all the Dervish forces in the province he had hardly any means of enforcing his authority. His rebukes and exhortations, however, gradually roused Hammuda, and during May two or three minor raids were planned and executed, and the Egyptian position at Akasha was several times reconnoitred.  Bishara remained unsatisfied, and at length, despairing of infusing energy into Hammuda, he ordered his subordinate Osman Azrak to supersede him. Osman was a Dervish of very different type. He was a fanatical and devoted believer in the Mahdi and a loyal follower of the Khalifa. For many years he had served on the northern frontier of the Dervish Empire, and his name was well known to the Egyptian Government as the contriver of the most daring and the most brutal raids. His cruelty to the wretched inhabitants of the border villages had excluded him from all hope of mercy should he ever fall into the hands of the enemy. His crafty skill, however, protected him, and among the Emirs gathered at Firket there was none whose death would have given greater satisfaction to the military authorities than the man who was now to replace Hammuda.

I am writing to share with you several proposed revisions to the text of the EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment. Our team has been diligently working to refine this document in order to improve its clarity, accuracy, and overall coherence. These suggested modifications aim to enhance the reader’s comprehension and ensure coherent continuity of our processes. Firstly, in Section II, which deals with 'Terms and Conditions,' the text could benefit from a clearer, more precise presentation of the subject matter. Current verbiage seems generic and may lead to confusion. I propose that we refine our language and make the implications of agreeing to these terms explicitly clear. This would entail replacing jargon with simpler, yet professional language, making the statements more directly relatable to our clients. Secondly, in Section IV, 'Client Information,' we need to tighten our confidentiality clause. The present language is not robust enough and leaves room for potential ambiguity and legal loopholes. I suggest we seek legal counsel to draft a stringent, unambiguous confidentiality clause that enforces the highest level of data protection. Furthermore, in Section VI, 'Dispute Resolution,' the existing text appears to lack an adequate explanation of the mechanisms for resolving potential conflicts. I would recommend providing a more comprehensive step-by-step guide, along with examples to handle possible contentious situations. This not only aids our clients but also equips our sales team with solid information for defusing conflicts. Lastly, on a general note, I suggest we produce a concise executive summary at the beginning of the document. This would give the reader a quick snapshot of the entire amendment and its impact. It also sets the groundwork for the details to follow, making it easier for the client to understand and absorb. I hope you find these suggestions valuable and they contribute to enhancing the quality and effectiveness of our EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment document. They are, of course, open for further discussion and refinement as deemed appropriate by the team. Please take your time to review these proposed modifications, and feel free to add any feedback or additional suggestions. I am available to discuss these changes further at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

(CNN) -- The amateur video shows men, shirtless and seeming dangerously drunk, rolling on the ground or staggering near a counter top covered with booze bottles. Another part of the video shows a man babbling incoherently with a syringe nearby. This is not a scene at a college frat house. It is a video of employees of an American security contractor working in Kabul, Afghanistan. \\"It reminded me of times I'd visit my friends going to college that were in fraternities,\\" said John Melson, a former employee of Jorge Scientific who was based at that villa in Kabul on assignment to support efforts to train Afghan security personnel. But OPTIONS: - Afghan rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - Afghanistan rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - American rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - CNN rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - John Melson rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - Jorge Scientific rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - Kabul rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. - The Company rejected the suggestion that work was compromised.","output":"The amateur video of employees of the American security contractor, Jorge Scientific, raises concerns about the conduct and professionalism of these individuals as they participate in the crucial task of training Afghan security personnel. The situation has the potential to impact not only the immediate work environment but also the overarching goals of the mission in Afghanistan. Jorge Scientific rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. However, it's vital to critically analyze whether such behavior could have any effect on the mission and its objectives: 1. Operating in a foreign country: When working in another nation, it is important for security contractors and their employees to respect local customs, values, and sensitivities. The inappropriate and unprofessional behavior displayed in the video runs the risk of offending local partners and harming the reputation of both the company and the broader mission. 2. Trust and confidence: The partnership between the security contractors and the local Afghan security personnel relies on trust and confidence. Such incidents can erode the faith of the local population in the ability of these professionals to deliver effective training and support. This could lead to a deterioration in the relationship between the security contractors and the local Afghan forces and ultimately damage the wider effort to stabilize and secure the country. 3. Safety and security: The video shows employees handling dangerous materials, such as syringes and excessive amounts of alcohol, in a careless manner, posing significant risks to their health and safety. Such reckless behavior could lead to accidents and injuries, which might result in strained resources, negative attention, and increased costs for the company and the mission. 4. Employee performance: Engaging in excessive alcohol consumption and substance abuse can have a detrimental effect on an individual's ability to perform their duties. This could result in decreased productivity, poor decision-making, and a lack of focus, which might undermine the overall effectiveness of the training and support provided to Afghan security personnel. 5. Workplace culture: The video portrays a lax and irresponsible work environment, which might encourage similarly inappropriate behavior among other employees. This could contribute to a negative workplace culture, affecting morale, teamwork, and overall performance. While Jorge Scientific has rejected the suggestion that such behavior could compromise the work being done, it's necessary to recognize the potential effects of such conduct on the mission's success. The delicate and important nature of the task of training and supporting Afghan security forces requires the utmost professionalism, dedication, and respect for local values and customs. Incidents like these could jeopardize the mission and harm both immediate operations and the long-term goals in Afghanistan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug-centred trip to Wales. The humour was gentle and subtle, as indeed were the three characters (witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper). The atmospherics of rural Wales were captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Cleverly and carefully scripted, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them. Very light in touch and full of fun - not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticise, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales.

Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones. He was terrified his bride would bleed to death.  Stephen and Shelli had married just six months before near their home in South Jordan, Utah. They were in Hawaii on a family vacation with two of their sons. The family had rented electric motors and headed towards a nature preserve near Waikiki. But Shelli had fallen behind and the family turned back to make sure she was okay.  Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself. On the first and second days there, she lived through half a dozen operations. On day three, the worst of Stephen's fears came true. Shelli didn't wake. She had shown heart failure and lung failure. \\"I thought every heartbeat would be her last,\\" Stephen says.  As days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance.  And he decided there still was a chance.  The family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. \\"Did you understand that?\\" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks.  Shelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. \\"She's got her life back. She's able to love and be loved, and be the person she was.\\" Elovie says.  When Shelli hears about each step in her recovery, she calls it \\"miracle after miracle\\".

Article: A One Star rating requires a solid performance on all four tracks of the Cup. While the game doesn't tell you the exact requirements, there are a few general guidelines to follow. If you're partway through a cup and fall way behind these goals, you may want to quit and retry to save time.  Finish the cup with at least 53 points total across the four tracks. For instance, you could place 1st, 1st, 1st, 4th, or 1st, 1st, 2nd, 3rd (the order does not matter). You have a high chance of success if you place 1st, 1st, 1st, 2nd or better. Faster completion time will also help. Avoid leaving the road more than two or three times in the entire cup, unless using a boost item. Avoid banging into a wall or an obstacle more than once or twice in the cup. Avoid falling off the track more than once in the cup. Stay in first for a significant amount of each race. When behind, try to catch up without using items whenever possible. If you are hit with many blue shells and similar items in a short amount of time, the game will take this into account and relax the above guidelines a little. If this happens, you may still be able to get a One Star ranking even if you use items to get in first, or if you don't finish in the rank or time limit normally required. If you are having trouble finishing in 1st or 2nd, play a Medium or Large character and a vehicle with good speed. If you can stay in 1st for much of the race, but you frequently hit obstacles or walls, play a Medium or Small character and a vehicle with good handling and acceleration. Before racing, you can set your drifting mode to Automatic or Manual. For best results, set it to Manual and be prepared to press the B button (and shake the Wii mote, if in use) to start drifting sideways when you notice sparks from your wheels. However, if you are using the Wii Wheel, Automatic may give better results do to increased manual drifting difficulty with that controller. . Mario Kart Wii allows you to cut down your time and dodge obstacles by doing tricks, \\"snaking,\\" \\"drifting,\\" and using the rear camera view. Find out more at this article. Many race tracks have hidden shortcuts and opportunities for creative driving techniques. Discover more of these by playing Time Trials and following the ghost driver to see what it does, or search online for videos of the race tracks you find difficult. Remember, going off-road will not hurt your ranking if you use a Mushroom or other boost item. This can save you a lot of time on some maps, such as by boosting through the Peach Garden flower patch or across the grass near the start of Bowser's Castle. What is a summary?","output":"To achieve a One Star rating in Mario Kart Wii, players must perform well across the four tracks of the Cup, amassing at least 53 points. To increase the chances of success, minimize the number of instances leaving the road or hitting walls/obstacles, and maintain the first position for a significant portion of each race. Using an appropriate character/vehicle combination based on your strengths and weaknesses is key, as well as setting the drifting mode to optimize your performance. Finally, utilizing tricks, discovering shortcuts, and optimal use of boost items will contribute to overall success and a possible One Star rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  Two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system. Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future.

By doing things in a way other people don't expect you'll demonstrate that you can think on your feet. That is one way people seem to judge cleverness.  For example: if your professor gives you an essay assignment, ask them if you could do a creative option. Demonstrate how your option fulfills the requirements while going above and beyond. (If you're taking a class on short stories, ask if you could try your hand at writing a short story of your own using what you've learned in class, and write a follow-up piece examining your own work.) This is also about doing the unexpected. If you always go by the rules or do things exactly as you learned them it doesn't mean you're not smart, it simply means that people aren't going to see you as clever. So, don't rely on your particular intelligence and typical ways of doing things. This step ties into not always going by the book, because a lot times you'll need to think outside the box to do that. To be clever you will need to come up with creative solutions to problems.  Re-conceptualize the problem. One thing that people who use creative solutions do effectively, is to re-imagine a problem. To practice this skill, take an obvious choice (like writing a plain old essay) and re-imagine how else you might approach the essay so that you still get the same information across, but in a different, more engaging way (telling a story orally, creating a collage or painting).  Daydream. It turns out that daydreaming is actually incredibly beneficial to boosting creative problem-solving. The process of daydreaming helps you to form connections and recall information. This is why a lot of your best ideas may come out during the shower or right before you go to bed. If you're having difficulty with something, take a little time out to daydream. Chances are, by relaxing and letting your brain roam free, you'll come up with something creative that works.  Brainstorming is another great way to foster creativity, especially in a group. Present the problem and have people give whatever ideas come into their head without passing judgement on these ideas. Have people add to the ideas as they come. You can do this on your own too, as long as you make sure to keep judgment out of the process. Fear is one of the biggest obstacles to creative thinking, which is one big aspect of cleverness. The more creative and workable your solutions and ideas, the more people will believe in your abilities.  Ask yourself things like: what happens if you lose your job? what if you lose your best customer? what if you fail your class? what if the publisher doesn't buy your book? The answer to any of these questions can either free you up from fear, or it can show where you need to work on your solutions, which in turn will open up opportunities and further ideas. When you're coming up with ideas and potential solutions, don't open them up for criticism until they're more formed. Criticism and the fear of criticism can be a big creativity killer, which can kill your cleverness, too. When you're out of the brainstorming stage and better able to evaluate the ideas, that's when you get feedback and take criticism. Having problems and opportunities that are ill-defined and super vague can make it incredibly difficult to come up with punchy or creative solutions and ideas. Even if issues and things you need to deal with come to you without parameters, set some for yourself.  Setting \\"imaginary\\" or \\"pretend\\" parameters can foster your ideas. For example, if you're working on a project for work pretend that you're out of money, how do you accomplish your task without it? Pretend you can't follow the rules, written or unwritten, how would you do things different? Pretend there's a fast time limit on coming up with your solution (say a 5 minute time limit)? What can you come up with in that short period of time? For example, Dr. Seuss wrote Green Eggs and Ham because of a challenge from his editor to come up with a full book in under 50 different words. That restriction helped him come up with one of the best known Dr. Seuss books. Summary:","output":"To demonstrate cleverness and think on your feet, it's important to think outside the box and approach tasks in unexpected ways. Start by re-conceptualizing the problem and exploring creative ways to fulfill its requirements. Daydreaming can help unlock creative problem-solving by allowing your brain to form connections and recall information. Brainstorming with others, or by yourself, can also foster creativity as long as you suspend judgment during the process. Overcoming fear and embracing opportunities can help expand your ideas and boost your cleverness. To generate more creative ideas, set parameters for yourself, even if they are imaginary. Pretend you have limited resources, time, or the inability to follow standard rules. This can inspire you to think of new and clever solutions to problems. Remember to open your ideas up to criticism only after they are more formed to prevent stifling creativity. By practicing these techniques, you can develop your cleverness and showcase your ability to think on your feet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She sees many of her former teammates and friends, prompting a flashback to 1943. When World War II threatens to shut down Major League Baseball, candy magnate and Cubs owner Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall) persuades his fellow owners to bankroll a women's league. Ira Lowenstein (David Strathairn) is put in charge, and Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) is sent out to recruit players. Capadino attends an industrial-league softball game in rural Oregon and likes what he sees in Dottie, the catcher for a local dairy's team. Dottie turns down Capadino's offer, happy with her simple farm life while waiting for her husband Bob (Bill Pullman) to come back from the war. Her sister (and teammate) Kit (Lori Petty), however, is desperate to get away and make something of herself. Capadino is not impressed by Kit's hitting performance, but agrees to take her along if she can change Dottie's mind. Dottie agrees, but only for her sister's sake.

Q:I have waited tables, but before that, our friend group were regulars at several local “open all night” establishments. Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again. Question: How did the main character feel about the waitress at Denny's? Options:  A. They didn't like her service.  B. It was their favorite waitress.  C. They made fun of her because she was rude.

People are concerned that these corn plants might transfer modified genetic material to other plants. Which of the following is the best way to further modify the plants to prevent them from transferring their genetic materials to other plants? Select from the following. a). changing the plants so they do not make pollen b). changing the plants so they do not harm insects c). changing the plants so they cannot produce nutrients d). changing the plants so they cannot be easily identified","output":"a). Changing the plants so they do not make pollen The best way to modify these genetically modified corn plants to prevent them from transferring their genetic material to other plants would be to change them so that they do not produce pollen. Pollen is an essential part of plant reproduction, as it carries the male genetic information that fertilizes the female part of a plant. By altering the plants to prevent them from making pollen, they would be rendered unable to spread their modified genetic material to other plants through natural pollination processes. This approach has several advantages over the other options: b). Changing the plants so they do not harm insects may lower the concern about transferring genetic materials, but it would not eliminate the possibility of gene flow between plants. Pollination could still occur, and the modified genetic material could still be shared with other plants. Moreover, changing the plants so they do not harm insects would defeat the purpose of genetic modification if the goal was to create a natural pesticide. c). Changing the plants so they cannot produce nutrients would make the plants unsustainable and negatively impact their growth, development, and overall health. This option would also be counterproductive, as the plants could not survive without producing the necessary nutrients they need to grow. Also, this approach would not entirely eliminate the chances of gene transfer, as there is still the possibility of pollen or other reproductive tissues transferring genetic material. d). Changing the plants so they cannot be easily identified does not address the problem of gene transfer between plants at all. While this may make it difficult for humans to differentiate between genetically modified and non-genetically modified plants, it would not stop modified genetic material from being shared with other plants, especially through cross-pollination. In conclusion, eliminating pollen production (option a) is the most effective way to prevent genetically modified corn plants from transferring their genetic material to other plants. This approach directly addresses the mechanism of gene flow by targeting the pollen production, which plays a vital role in plant reproduction, and thus could provide a reliable solution to minimize, if not altogether prevent, the spread of the modified genetic material."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Condemned to Live Movie plot: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave.

In addition to the damage to crops and livestock tanks, hogs cost untold damage to suburban yards.      Miller said they will use the pesticide, Kaput Feral Hog Lure, as bait food laced with warfarin which is the same drug used to kill rats. It can also be prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots      But the move has upset hunters, who’ve gathered more than 1,200 signatures in opposition within two days.      “We don’t think poison is the way to go,” said Eydin Hansen, Vice President of the Texas Hog Hunters Association.      He prefers hunting and trapping methods to control the invasive species.      Hansen has been hunting hogs since he was 16.      “It’s a way to feed your family,” he said.      He worries soon he won’t want to take that risk.      “If this hog is poisoned, do I want to feed it to my family? I can tell you, I don’t.”      Hunters and conservationists are afraid other animals may be exposed to toxin.      “If a hog dies, what eats it? Coyotes, buzzards…” said Hansen. “We’re gonna affect possibly the whole ecosystem.”      The Kaput product website claims its low toxicity decreases that risk.      The company has also created a bait station to disseminate it that limits access to other wildlife.      Hansen remains skeptical.      “I personally don’t think it’s going to work,” he said.      Miller told the state, in light of the product’s approval, his department would no longer need 900,000 earmarked for feral hog control research.      As a state senator, Miller authored legislation that allowed for the shooting of wild hogs from helicopters. Now, more than 27,000 wild pigs are killed that way, according to the Austin American-Statesman. ||||| Photo: AP      Texas’s 2.5 million feral pigs may soon fall victim to chemical warfare. On Tuesday, the state’s Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller changed the rules of the Texas Administrative Code to permit the legal poisoning of these unsuspecting hogs.      Advertisement      Before feeling too bad for the poor piggies, know that feral hogs are a national problem that cost us around 1.5 billion. They wreak at least 52 million in damages to Texas agriculture each year by ruining crops and livestock tanks. According to the Austin American Statesman, these deranged creatures cause “untold damage in suburban areas, where they dig up homeowners’ yards and dine on cable and internet lines.”      On solving the problem of the pigs, Miller said, “They’re so prolific, you can’t hardly keep them in check. This is going to be the hog apocalypse, if you like: If you want them gone, this will get them gone.”      “This is going to be the hog apocalypse, if you like: If you want them gone, this will get them gone.”      The agent of this impending apocalypse? Kaput Feral Hog Lure is a bait food laced with warfarin, a colorless and flavorless rodentcide. In smaller doses, warfarin is also used as a blood thinner in humans. Warfarin holds particular significance in world history—a study from 2003 suggests it might’ve been used to poison Stalin during his last dinner with the Politburo, and President Eisenhower was an early user of the drug, which he was given after a heart attack in 1955.      Advertisement      While Richard Poché, the president of the company that makes Kaput, assured Texans that the risk of using warfarin is minimal, local hunters are concerned. A petition opposing the use of warfarin has more than 12,000 signatures. Eydin Hansen, Vice President of the Texas Hog Hunters Association, told CBS News, “We don’t think poison is the way to go.”      Miller argued for the safety of warfarin by pointing out that it turns the dead hog’s fat bright blue, “a dead giveaway.”      But as Hansen explained, “If a hog dies, what eats it? Coyotes, buzzards… We’re gonna affect possibly the whole ecosystem.”      Advertisement      Sponsored      Edwin Parker, a Texan hog buyer, had the same concerns as Hansen. Additionally, he told ABC 9 KTRE, “We slaughter a few pigs and give them to people in a tight situation and need something to eat. If word gets out that all the hogs are poisoned we aren’t going to want to risk making our kids sick, family sick.”      Though Kaput is only allowed to be in feeders that adult hogs can access, the worry about it contaminating non-target species is legitimate. State wildlife veterinarian Jim LaCour spoke to the New Orleans Times-Picayune about his concerns with Louisiana possibly adopting warfarin to deal with its feral hog problem:      Advertisement      When the hogs eat, they’re going to drop crumbs on the outside, where small rodents can get them and not only intoxicate themselves but also birds of prey that eat them. Since the poison will be on the landscape for weeks on end, the chances of these birds eating multiple affected animals is pretty good.      “Chemical feral hog apocalypse” joins “President Donald J. Trump” and “fried chicken shell tacos” in the list of absurd realities that, in simpler times, seemed utterly impossible.      [Austin American Statesman via CBS News] ||||| Some have misgivings, but Miller says the product is safe.      The man who gained fame for successfully allowing hunters to shoot hogs from helicopters is now championing another strategy to hasten what he calls “the feral hog apocalypse”: poison.      Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller will announce Tuesday that he is approving a pesticide, “Kaput Feral Hog Lure,” for statewide use. He says the product, poisoned bait food, is the first specifically designed to control the feral hog population, now estimated at more than 2.5 million in Texas.      Feral hogs cause at least 50 million in damage annually to Texas agriculture, destroying crops and livestock tanks, as well as causing untold damage in suburban areas, where they dig up homeowners’ yards and dine on cable and internet lines.      “They’re so prolific, you can’t hardly keep them in check,” Miller told the American-Statesman. Sows have been known to produce two litters a year, typically with four to six offspring in each litter. “This is going to be the hog apocalypse, if you like: If you want them gone, this will get them gone.”      As a state senator, Miller authored legislation that allowed for the aerial killing of hogs. Now, on average, 27,500 hogs are killed that way annually.      Feral hogs were introduced to North America by Spanish settlers who set domestic pigs free into the woods so that they could breed freely. Overall, as many as 750,000 are harvested annually, but the problem is a growing one.      Enter Kaput.      The product is basically bait food laced with warfarin, used as a blood thinner for humans but apparently lethal in hogs.      TEXAS POLITICS DELIVERED EVERY DAY: Sign up for our Texas Politics email      Miller said licensees will be able to set out nontoxic bait food for the hogs in feeders that require the strength of an adult hog to access. Once the hogs grow accustomed to the food, licensees can replace the nontoxic bait with the toxic variety.      Miller, who said he is changing state agricultural rules to allow the product’s use, said Kaput presents a “minimal risk to other animals” because it requires much higher dosages to affect other wildlife populations or livestock.      He said officials at the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service support the rule change and the use of warfarin for feral hog population control, but an official at Texas A&M who oversees feral hog operations declined to comment Monday.      The product was developed by Colorado-based Genesis Laboratories and will be sold by its sister company, Scimetrics.      “Hogs are particularly sensitive to warfarin,” Genesis President Richard Poché said.      Poché said the hog bait contains only one-fifth of the concentration found in conventional rat and mouse baits. He said that after 25 years of working with warfarin, numerous studies have found only minimal effects on wildlife, such as ferrets, magpies, alligators and birds of various species, when used at the low concentration in the bait.      Texas Parks and Wildlife Department spokesman Steve Lightfoot said the agency had been consulted.      “These invasive animals destroy native habitats, indirectly impacting our state’s wildlife resources that rely on these habitats, and the department strongly supports and encourages feral hog control management practices,” he said.      “As for nontarget species, we can’t speculate on the impacts to wildlife species should exposure or consumption take place because dose, dose frequency, body mass and species sensitivity will likely be highly variable. Studies have shown that individual animals, such as rodents and raptors, can be affected through primary and secondary consumption of warfarin.”      LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Lone Star Politics page brings Capitol news to your Facebook feed      Miller said hunters will be able to tell if the feral hog has consumed Kaput because the fat will be a bright blue.      “It’s a dead giveaway,” said Miller, who said the product has won federal approval.      The Texas Department of Agriculture got 900,000 from the Legislature in the last biennium to research feral hog control. So confident is he in Kaput, he said, that he will tell appropriators not to give his agency that money again.      “I am excited to see a new tool to address the feral hog populations,” said Nick Dornak, who oversees the Caldwell County Feral Hog Task Force, which has received 80,000 in state funding over the past four years and has removed more than 10,000 hogs during that period. “My concern would be that there’s any thought of this being a magic bullet for feral hog control in the state. We need trapping, we need aerial control, and not all landowners are willing to put poison on their property.”      Officials in Louisiana, where the product is also under consideration, have sounded less bullish than Miller.      A Louisiana state wildlife veterinarian told the New Orleans Times-Picayune that the hogs might drop crumbs of the bait food on the ground, where other wildlife can get to it. He also raised concerned that black bears — which also live in Texas — could get to the food. |||||","output":"Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has approved the use of the first pesticide to target wild pigs in the state.

ASCII is a character encoding standard (comprised of 128 characters represented by numbers) that is used widely in the computer and information systems industry to represent text for communication between computers and devices. It is based on the English alphabet and includes digits, punctuation marks, and common symbols. The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) indeed prefers the name \\"US-ASCII,\\" but both names refer to the same character encoding system. The ASCII standard is widely used because it allows for consistency and ease of communication across different computing platforms, programming languages, and software systems. Developed in the 1960s, it was a crucial innovation for the adoption of digital technology both in the United States and internationally. As computing systems evolved, new character encoding systems, with more characters and support for a multitude of languages, were created. These systems include Unicode, which extends and supersedes ASCII, providing comprehensive support for characters, scripts, and symbols from diverse languages and historical eras. In conclusion, the statement, \\"ASCII (i/ˈæski/ ASS-kee), abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character-encoding scheme (the IANA prefers the name US-ASCII)\\" does accurately answer the question about what ASCII stands for.

In prediabetic states insulin secretion and action—potential targets of preventive interventions—are impaired. In trials lifestyle modification (i.e. weight loss and exercise) has proven effective in preventing incident T2DM in high-risk groups, although weight loss has the greatest effect. Various medications (e.g. metformin, thiazolidinediones and acarbose) can also prevent or delay T2DM. Whether diabetes-prevention strategies also ultimately prevent the development of diabetic vascular complications is unknown, but cardiovascular risk factors are favorably affected. Preventive strategies that can be implemented in routine clinical settings have been developed and evaluated.

His pride swells along with his tattooed biceps. He's a dying breed, a blue-collar American working on a product as American as apple pie. Blue jeans. \\"This is our lifeline,\\" Wolfe says. Those jeans you squeezed into this morning? It's likely they began right here at Mount Vernon Mills, one of the last functioning cotton mills in America and the nation's No. 1 producer of denim. In a tiny enclave of northwest Georgia, Wolfe and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans. Blame corporate greed for the selling out of","output":"America's iconic textile industry. As globalization took hold and the search for cheap labor intensified, many American corporations shifted their manufacturing bases overseas – leaving cities like Trion and its hardworking folk to reckon with the consequences. Thousands of textile mills have closed their doors since the 1970s, but Wolfe and his tight-knit community carry on the tradition at Mount Vernon Mills, determined to prove that American-made denim can still compete on the world stage. In an age of mass-produced fast fashion, Wolfe's team stands out like a beacon of hope. These dedicated workers preserve the values of quality and craftsmanship that once defined our nation's textile heritage. Day in and day out, the hum of machinery and the scent of raw cotton fill the air as the mill weaves its magic – turning humble natural fibers into one of the most sought-after materials across the globe. Wolfe's \\"Tough As Nails, I Love America\\" ethos might seem out of place in today's profit-driven market, but it's this very spirit that has kept Mount Vernon Mills afloat amid turbulent times. These workers have endured hardships, faced stiff competition from cheap imports, and witnessed dramatic technological changes – and yet their mill continues to thrive. They have weathered the storm by staying true to their roots and doubling down on quality. But what does the future hold for this last bastion of genuine American blue-collar labor? Can Mount Vernon Mills stand firm against the tide of globalization and increased automation? These are the questions lingering in the minds of locals as they clock in for their shifts, their hands worn and calloused from decades spent crafting America's favorite fabric. Trion's leaders are also acutely aware of the challenges that lie ahead. As small-town industries falter across the country, they must adapt and innovate to attract new businesses and secure the future for their community. This means investing in infrastructure and education while providing opportunities for people like Wolfe to upskill and diversify their careers. Although the odds may seem stacked against them, Mount Vernon Mills is a testament to the grit and unyielding determination that embody the American spirit. Its workers remind us that there is value in standing by our heritage and embracing the craftsmanship that made this country great. Like Wolfe's bulging biceps, there remain pockets of unwavering strength in the face of adversity. So next time you pull on your blue jeans, take a moment to recognize the labor of love and endurance that brought them into existence. As the cotton mills grow fewer in number and the machines more advanced, it's vital to cherish the legacy of tireless American hands and the communities that foster them. For now, at least, Mount Vernon Mills remains a beacon of hope, proving that the dream of American-made denim is very much alive. It's up to the industry, consumers, and policymakers alike to decide whether this dream perseveres."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.  Which compound would have lower melting point, compound A or compound B?  Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. The answer to this question is:","output":"Compound B would have a lower melting point.  As mentioned in the hint, polar compounds generally have higher melting and boiling points due to the additional energy required to overcome the weak hydrogen bonds that exist between polar molecules. Nonpolar compounds, on the other hand, do not have these hydrogen bonds, and therefore, require less energy to change from a solid to a liquid state. In case A, Mike changed the state of a polar compound (compound A) from solid to liquid, which would typically require more energy and higher temperatures due to the hydrogen bonds presence. In case B, Mike changed the state of a nonpolar compound (compound B) from solid to liquid, which would usually require less energy and lower temperatures as there are no hydrogen bonds to overcome.  Since it takes higher temperatures for changes of state to occur in polar compounds, compound B, the nonpolar compound, would have a lower melting point than compound A, the polar compound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to who is the strait of gibraltar named after??","output":"The Strait of Gibraltar, a narrow waterway connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea, is not named after a person, but after a geographical location. The name \\"Gibraltar\\" comes from the Arabic term \\"Jebel Tariq,\\" which means \\"Mountain of Tariq\\" or \\"Rock of Tariq.\\" This refers to the Rock of Gibraltar, a prominent landmark on the European side of the strait. The Rock of Gibraltar and the surrounding region have had a long and storied history, with significance to various civilizations, and it is essential to understand the context to appreciate the origins of the name. In the year 711, a Muslim Berber general named Tariq ibn Ziyad led an invading force from North Africa across the strait into what is now modern-day Spain. He landed near the rock, which, as a result, was named after him. This invasion marked the beginning of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, an endeavor that linked the European continent with the Muslim caliphate for the first time and initiated eight centuries of Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula, known as Al-Andalus. The original name, Jebel Tariq, was subsequently adapted into several languages as the region changed hands over time. In Spanish, it became \\"Gibraltar,\\" while the English extrapolated this into present-day \\"Gibraltar.\\" Through the various occupations and the shifting of power, the location retained its significance as a strategic gateway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The Strait of Gibraltar, as a crucial and historic maritime corridor, took its name after the Rock of Gibraltar that loomed over it. This strait, approximately 9 miles (14 kilometers) wide at its narrowest point, has been a major shipping route and geopolitical focus across different civilizations due to its geographic significance. In conclusion, the Strait of Gibraltar is named after the Rock of Gibraltar which, in turn, was named after the Muslim Berber general Tariq ibn Ziyad, who landed near the rock during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the year 711. The strait's name reflects a rich historical past while emphasizing its strategic position connecting two major bodies of water."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, suppose when you're running, you accidentally bump into your friend, causing them to fall down. That's kind of like what happened with Caitlyn Jenner.  You know, Caitlyn Jenner, the famous person on TV? Well, she was in her car (which is like her running in our game of tag), and she accidentally bumped into another car. The person in that car, a 70-year-old woman named Kimberly Howe, sadly passed away because of it. Caitlyn was scared because sometimes when bad things happen because of an accident, even if it's really, really an accident, people can still get in trouble. She was afraid she might have to go to a men's prison because she was born a man but later transitioned to become a woman. But guess what? The Los Angeles district attorney, who is like the game master in our game of tag, decided that Caitlyn didn't break the rules. They said they didn't have enough evidence or proofs, sort of like clues, to say that Caitlyn did something very wrong or \\"unreasonable\\" during the accident. In fact, they found out that Caitlyn was driving her car slower than the speed limit, which is like the maximum speed you're allowed to run in our game of tag, and \\"minimally slower\\" than Kimberly Howe. Also, Kimberly had to stop her car really suddenly because of another car ahead of her that stopped suddenly too. So Caitlyn couldn't avoid bumping into Kimberly's car. Now Caitlyn's lawyer, who is like a helper in our game when we don't know if we've broken the rules, told People (which is a news magazine) that they're relieved the District Attorney agreed that even a small punishment would be inappropriate, or not right.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

Answer:","output":"Officer Alex J. Murphy became better known by the name \\"RoboCop\\" in the title of the 1987 science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven. The film was produced by Orion Pictures and is set in a dystopian and crime-ridden Detroit, Michigan. It stars Peter Weller as Alex J. Murphy, a police officer who is brutally murdered by a vicious gang led by crime lord Clarence Boddicker. In the storyline, the Omni Consumer Products (OCP) corporation, which has recently entered into a contract with the city to manage and improve the underfunded and struggling Detroit Police Department, uses this opportunity to revive their project to create a cyborg law enforcement officer. The project, known as \\"RoboCop,\\" utilizes Officer Murphy's body and integrates it with advanced robotic technology, creating a superhuman, crime-fighting machine. Once operational, RoboCop is programmed to follow three primary directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. The film follows RoboCop's journey as he regains fragments of his human memories and embarks on a mission to not only bring justice to Detroit but also avenge his own brutal murder. His hunt for Clarence Boddicker leads to a larger conspiracy involving senior executives at OCP, particularly the ambitious and ruthless Vice President, Dick Jones. Through the course of the film, RoboCop's human emotions surface, enabling him to overcome his programming limitations and ultimately triumph over the corrupt forces. \\"RoboCop\\" received critical acclaim for its blending of intense action, social satire, and dark humor while exploring themes such as gentrification, corporate greed, and the privatization of public services. It was a commercial success and spawned two sequels, a television series, several video games, and comic books. A reboot of the film, maintaining the same title, was released in 2014, with the story adapted to a more contemporary setting. Nevertheless, the original 1987 \\"RoboCop\\" remains an iconic piece of science fiction and action cinema, and Officer Alex J.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Daily Poll: How Concerned Are You About the Economy’s Impact on Tech? Today’s poll is a bit of a diversion from our usual technology focused questions, but given recent macro headlines, I figured it may be interesting. According to a USA Today-Gallup Poll published yesterday, 66% of Americans already think the US economy is in a recession, with 59% believing we could be headed for a multi-year depression. Meanwhile, it seems that companies in the Web space are moving fast to either cash out (Bebo selling to AOL) or raise new money at aggressive valuations (Meebo, and now reportedly RockYou according to Valleywag and AllThingsD) before capital dries up. Oh yea, and in case you missed it, one of the world’s largest investment banks – Bear Stearns – sold itself for 2/share to JP Morgan over the weekend. That said, a new report out today from eMarketer shows that online advertising – which the majority of companies in our space depend on – is still expected to grow strongly, to the tune of a 23% increase in 2008. The theory goes that as budgets tighten, advertisers will prefer to spend more money online, since results are more measurable.

In response, some companies are rushing to cash out, like Bebo selling to AOL, or aggressively raising new money at high valuations, such as Meebo and reportedly RockYou. This urgency arises from the fear of capital drying up in the uncertain economic climate. In contrast to the economic concerns, a report from eMarketer shows that online advertising is expected to grow significantly, with a 23% increase in 2008.

This could refer to various aspects, such as adapting to the culture, integrating into the society, learning the language, or even seeking education or job opportunities. The Western world typically includes countries in Western Europe, the Americas, and Australia, which share common historical, cultural, and political ties. It is predominantly characterized by its democratic governance, capitalism, and various cultural norms and values, such as individualism, human rights, and social equality. As a result, some people from other regions of the world might perceive the Western world as an attractive destination for personal, social, or economic reasons. Supporting people in approaching the Western world may involve a wide range of activities and initiatives. For instance, organizations or individuals may provide language courses in English, French, Spanish, or other Western languages to facilitate communication. Moreover, the support can extend to offering cultural orientation and integration classes, where newcomers learn about local customs, values, and traditions. Another form of assistance could come in the shape of vocational training, internships, or job opportunities that enable individuals to build a sustainable livelihood and contribute to their host country's economy. Furthermore, educational institutions may offer scholarships or financial aid to international students, granting them access to higher education in Western countries. There may also be specialized mentorship or support programs for specific communities or groups, such as women, refugees, or people with disabilities, ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities and access to resources when approaching the Western world. By offering such support to people interested in engaging with the Western world, we can create an environment that fosters cultural exchange, understanding, and appreciation while providing individuals with valuable opportunities for growth and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not even) than Pretty Woman, but it (was) a new topic for Bollywood. The topic was accepted but it is far from Jism, Murder, and Julie. To tell you the truth, the topic is presented in a very clean manner. But the plot has it's number of clichés. The beginning of the movie is presented in a very \\"filmi\\" way. There are some very little plot holes. The movie picks up once Rani has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning. The acting couldn't have been any better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses, and sometimes lets you down. Over here he gave one of the best performances. On top of that his role is written so well, that you applaud every time he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the movie, you feel for her character the most, but she is overshadowed by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is picture perfect. Out of the three, she gives everyone a run for their money. Its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent. And trust me, Madhubala is far from your girl next door. This role is one of the reasons why I rate her high. The supporting cast are like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no significance to the plot yet I found them tolerable here. The songs are pretty nice. The title song is my favorite of them all along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the World's Sight) are two song that fit the film perfectly.

With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  Now, I have a new situation: Burma had many tropical forests, while a sister country from a temperate climate, Belarus, had beautiful ancient temperate forests. Both countries were significant lumber exporters.  Answer this question please: Which country had a longer growing season? A:","output":"Burma had a longer growing season as it had tropical forests with more insolation and rainfall, leading to a longer growing season compared to the temperate forests of Belarus."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names had been registered.  - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers.  - The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.  - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate.  - Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.  - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s.  - EURid vzw / asbl ( European Registry for Internet Domains ) is a non-profit organisation appointed by the European Commission on 8 April 2003 as the domain name registry to operate the new . eu top - level domain . EURid is a consortium of three European ccTLD operators : DNS Belgium ( . be ) , IIT - CNR ( . it ) and NIC - SE ( . se ) . It has been established in Belgium , having its headquarters in Brussels . In October 2006 , they opened their first branch office in Stockholm . Two further branch offices have been opened in Italy and the Czech Republic . There are four associate members : the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia ( ARNES ) , the registry for . si , the national top - level domain for Slovenia , CZ.NIC , the registry for . cz , the national top - level domain for the Czech Republic , ISOC - ECC , the European chapter of the Internet Society , and BUSINESSEUROPE , a confederation of 39 industry - related federations from 33 countries . EURid uses the Extensible Provisioning Protocol ( EPP ) which enables registrars to perform operations on . eu domain names directly . The web site is available in all the official languages of the European Union : Bulgarian , Croatian , Danish , German , Czech , Estonian , English , Spanish , French , Italian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Hungarian , Dutch , Polish , Portuguese , Romanian , Slovak , Finnish , Swedish , Greek , Maltese , Irish and Slovenian .  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.  - A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an \\"absolute domain name\\", is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.  - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that is responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global multi-stakeholder community.  - A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code.  - .eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for organisations in and residents of EU member states. The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.  - A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that allow third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.  - The European Court of Justice (ECJ), officially just the Court of Justice, is the highest court in the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states.

Le pays a obtenu son indépendance du Portugal en 1975, mais a rapidement été envahi par l'Indonésie voisine, qui a annexé le territoire jusqu'à ce qu'il obtienne finalement son indépendance en 2002. Depuis lors, le Timor-Leste a connu une série de défis politiques, économiques et sociaux. Politiquement, le Timor-Leste possède un système parlementaire semi-présidentiel avec une histoire de transition démocratique. Cependant, la stabilité politique n'a pas toujours été garantie et des conflits et des tensions politiques ont parfois mené à la violence. Économiquement, le Timor-Leste est l'un des pays les plus pauvres d'Asie. Depuis son indépendance, le gouvernement a tenté de diversifier son économie, qui repose principalement sur les revenus des ressources naturelles, en particulier le pétrole et le gaz. Malgré ces efforts, la croissance économique reste limitée et la dépendance à l'égard de l'aide internationale est importante. Le chômage, la pauvreté et les inégalités sociales sont également d'importants défis auxquels le pays est confronté. Sur le plan social, le Timor-Leste a fait des progrès dans les domaines de la santé, de l'éducation et des droits humains, bien que de nombreux défis subsistent. Les infrastructures de base sont insuffisantes, en particulier en ce qui concerne l'accès à l'eau potable, à l'électricité et aux services de santé. De plus, la population fait face à des situations d'insécurité alimentaire et de malnutrition, qui sont particulièrement alarmantes chez les enfants. Les relations internationales du Timor-Leste sont également une question importante. Le pays entretient des relations étroites avec l'Australie, le Portugal et d'autres membres de la communauté internationale, mais trouve également un équilibre délicat avec l'Indonésie, son voisin puissant et ancien occupant. En outre, le Timor-Leste ambitionne de devenir membre à part entière de l'Association des nations de l'Asie du Sud-Est (ASEAN), ce qui pourrait contribuer à sa stabilité et à son développement. En conclusion, la situation au Timor-Leste est complexe et présente de nombreux défis politiques, économiques et sociaux.

New York is home to many stars, but it's only four times a year that its biggest sets right between the east-west streets of Manhattan's grid and turns almost all who cross its path into a paparazzi. Manhattanhenge, sometimes referred to as the Manhattan Solstice,  was scheduled to occur at 8:16 on Thursday night and a group of disappointed New Yorkers gathered to take a photo of the glistening sun. But while the sun and the grid system were perfectly aligned, the weather was not - with clouds blocking out the event. It wasn't until Friday night that onlookers were able to experience the magical moment where cosmopolitan meets cosmos at 8:19 p.m. Hundreds of people gathered all over Manhattan to witness the Manhattanhenge on Friday night. New Yorkers did everything they could to take a perfect photograph of the rare New York occurrence. The sun sat perfectly aligned behind buildings during the Manhattanhenge occurrence Friday night. The sun was radiant and in perfect view on Friday night as hundreds gathered to capture its rays. As the sun began to set completely, it did so amidst the sparking city lights that make New York 'the city that never sleeps' Some photographer attempted to take a post-modern approach to capturing the rare occurrence on Friday when the skies were clear. The term Manhattanhenge was coined in. 2002 by Neil deGrasse Tyson and is an amalgamation of Manhattan and. Stonehenge, the ancient English monument built in accordance with the. sun's path, explains Wordsense. The best. viewing on Friday night was along 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd and 57th streets, and along. both the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. In. a good year, Manhattan-henge lights up the city skyline with a burst of. red and orange and Friday nights spectacle was far more resilient than. the obfuscated sunset the night before. Earlier in the day on Thursday, the forecast looked. promising with clear blue skies, but as sunset drew close at 8.15pm -. and eager spectators lined the city streets - clouds obscured the sky. 'The setting sun aligns precisely with the. Manhattan street grid, creating a radiant glow of light across. Manhattan's brick and steel canyons,' Neil deGrasse Tyson, of the American Museum of Natural History, told USA Today. The spectacle lights up every cross street in Manhattan and is 'a unique urban phenomenon in the world, if not the universe', he added.

As the organist was nearing the end of the Prelude, he stepped up to the podium. \\"Please take your hymnals and turn to page 23, and let's stand and sing 'Holy, Holy, Holy.'\\" Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful. Standing there in her choir robe, she looked like a redheaded angel. If they could just get married, Greg could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her. Question: What does Greg wish he and Cynthia could do? Answer: A:","output":"Greg wishes he and Cynthia could get married so he could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 2: Weigh the positive and negative aspects. - The review has both a strong positive point (love the app) and a strong negative point (broken on another device). Step 3: Consider the user's experience and frustration. - The user seems to love the app but is experiencing frustration due to an issue on their 5x device, which might be a significant problem for them. Step 4: Determine the rating based on the balance of positive and negative aspects, as well as the user's experience. - The review is balanced with positive and negative aspects, so it isn't at either extreme (1 or 5). The user seems to enjoy the app, so the rating shouldn't be too low. However, the mentioned issue is likely causing notable frustration for the user, so it shouldn't be a high rating either. Based on the analysis, I would rate the review a 3 (neutral) out of 5. This is because the user clearly loves the app, but the significant issue on their 5x device may be causing considerable frustration and limiting their overall satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have had no problems with it, its easy to wipe down with bleach or whatever you use to clean with. You just put a bag in and there you go.. of course there is a slight smell from the champ but only after a few days (I change mine every three days or so) the diapers fit pretty good in the hole and the only problem I have is opening the lid sometimes can snap when you open it but other than that its been really great... Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light.  Step 1: Analyze the positive aspects mentioned in the review - The user has no problems using the Diaper Champ. - It's easy to clean. - The process of putting a bag in is simple. - It manages odors well for a few days. - Diapers fit well in the hole. - The user finds the product great overall. Step 2: Analyze the negative aspects mentioned in the review - There is a slight smell after a few days, which could imply that the odor control is not perfect. - The lid can sometimes snap when opening. Step 3: Compare positive and negative aspects - The positive aspects outweigh the negative aspects. Step 4: Conclude based on the comparison - Since the positive aspects are more prominent than the negative ones, the review is mostly flattering, depicting the Diaper Champ in a good light.

Information:  - Arsaces I (\\"Arshak\\") was the founder of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia, and after whom all 30+ monarchs of the Arsacid empire officially named themselves. A celebrated descent from antiquity (the Bagratid \\"line\\") begins with Arsaces. Arsaces or Ashk has also given name to the city of Ashkabad.  - Vologases I of Parthia ( Persian :     ) sometimes called Vologaeses or Vologeses or following Parthian usage , Walagash ( Persian :    Balsh ) was king of the Parthian Empire from about 51 until his death in 78 .  - The Parthian Empire (247 BC  224 AD), also known as the Arsacid Empire, was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq. Its latter name comes from Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I of Parthia (r. \\"c\\". 171138 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to eastern Iran. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han Empire of China, became a center of trade and commerce.  - The Seleucid Empire (\\"Basileía tn Seleukidn\\") was a Hellenistic state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, which existed from 312 BC to 63 BC; it was founded by Seleucus I Nicator following the division of the Macedonian empire vastly expanded by Alexander the Great. Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan.

Reasoning: Vologases I of Parthia was the king of the Parthian Empire, which was also known as the Arsacid Empire due to its foundation by Arsaces I of Parthia. Therefore, the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia is the noble family associated with Vologases I. The Seleucid Empire, on the other hand, is not related to Vologases I's noble family as it belonged to the Seleucid dynasty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, says he won't decide until next year whether the koala should be protected as an endangered species. He was expected to make his decision by the end of October. But that decision has been put off. Burke said he needed more time to go over the latest information about the koala's population. In September, an Australian Senate committee reported that there was no question the koala's population is on the decrease. \\"But they may not yet be eligible   for listing as a threatened species,\\" said Senator Doug Cameron. \\"To have such a significant Australian icon  included on the threatened species list would be a national shame.\\" The koala is found only in the eucalyptus   forests of Australia. And its population is reported to have fallen sharply for many reasons, including the cutting down of forests to make way for human beings' development, their own illness, climate change and killings by other animals such as wild dogs. And every year many koalas are hit by cars as they are trying to cross the busy roads. Putting off the decision on protection for the koala \\"is really bad news,\\" said Debbie Pointing, the president of the Koala Action Group. \\"We've worked tirelessly for many years to gather data on the populations,\\" Pointing said. \\"That data should be enough to make a decision.\\" However, Burke pointed out that the Australian government had spent at least 6.3 million on koala conservation efforts since 1996. senators listed efforts that are already underway in Queensland - the construction of special koala bridges as well as fences along roads, to keep the animals out of harm's way. Some people say that is not enough. \\"What we're doing at the moment is likely to drive this species to extinction,\\" Queensland University zoologist Bill Ellis said. \\"Koalas are an iconic Australian animal,\\" Burke told Australians. \\"They hold a special place in the hearts of Australians.\\" But it is a fact that if more isn't done to protect the koala, they might soon hold a place only in...

Options: - broke - headaches - grief - worries - empty  The answer is \\"broke\\" because A:","output":"If there is nothing left after paying bills, you are considered \\"broke.\\" So, out of the given options - broke, headaches, grief, worries, and empty - the most accurate and appropriate term to describe your financial situation is \\"broke.\\" Being broke means that you have exhausted all of your financial resources and have no money left at the end of a specific time period (like after paying bills, for example). Being in this situation can lead to a series of challenges and hardships. When you're broke, you may find it extremely difficult to afford basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. Furthermore, you might have trouble maintaining other aspects of your life that might require additional monetary support, such as emergency expenses, insurance premiums, healthcare, and maintenance costs. Being broke often comes with a great deal of stress and uncertainty. When one is in this financial position, they may suffer from headaches, grief, and worries – all of which are also included in the given list. These emotional responses can be direct by-products of dealing with financial strain. For instance, someone might experience headaches as a physical manifestation of stress, or grief due to feelings of personal failure, or worries about their ability to provide for their family. The term \\"empty\\" in this context may refer to an emotional experience due to financial struggles, but it's not the most accurate term to depict someone's financial situation when there is no money left after paying bills. Being broke addresses the very core of the financial state, highlighting that one lacks funds, whereas being empty would simply refer to the emotional heaviness that accompanies such a situation. Thus, the answer is \\"broke\\" because your financial reserves have been depleted, and you are left with no money to spare after addressing your bills and other financial obligations. While the other words — headaches, grief, worries, and empty — may represent feelings or experiences in association with being broke, they don't directly describe the financial situation at hand. The term \\"broke\\" most aptly encapsulates the absence of funds, which is the root cause of those emotions and experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Babies who watch TV are more likely to show late learning development and language at 14 months, especially if they are watching programs aimed at adults and older children, according to a new study, which would probably surprise those parents who leave their babies in front of a TV set. Babies who watched 60 minutes of TV daily had developmental scores a third lower at 14 months than babies who were watching less TV. Although their developmental scores were still in the normal range, the difference may have been due to the fact that when children and parents are watching TV, they are missing the talking, playing and other communications that are important to learning and development. This new study, which appeared in the Aechives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, followed 259 lower-income families in New York, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language at home. Other studies of higher-income families have also come to the same conclusion: TV watching is not only non-educational, but it seems to slow down babies' development. But what about \\"good\\" TV, like Sesame Street? The researchers didn't find any difference when compared to non-educational programs designed for small children, like Spongebob SquarePants. Earlier research by some of the same scientists, most of whom are at New York University School of Medicine's Bellevue Hospital Centre, has found that parents whose children watch non-educational TV programs like Spongebob SquarePants spend less time reading to their children or teaching them. At this point, parents reading this will probably be astonished. TV is so often a parent's good friend, keeping children happily occupied so that the adults can cook dinner, answer the phone, or take a shower. But, clearly, this electronic babysitter is not an educational aid. It is best to make sure the babies are fast asleep if you have to watch TV. Question: We can infer from the passage that  _  .

Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Let me provide you with a detailed description of this type of shop:  A beauty and skincare shop primarily specializes in offering a variety of products and items directly related to the care and enhancement of skin, hair, and overall personal appearance. These shops are specially curated to meet the growing needs of consumers who are conscious about their appearance, skincare, and grooming practices.  In such a shop, you can typically find a wide array of products, including but not limited to suntan lotion, sunscreens, facial care items, body care items, makeup, hair care products, and various beauty tools and accessories. These products are specifically designed and crafted to not only protect the skin from potential damage but also to enhance one's overall appearance. One of the key focuses of this type of shop is providing sun protection products, such as suntan lotion. Suntan lotion plays a crucial role in shielding our skin from harmful UV (ultraviolet) rays that can cause sunburn, premature aging, and increase the risk of skin cancer. These shops cater to diverse customer needs by offering various types of suntan lotions that vary in SPF (sun protection factor) levels, textures, and formulations suitable for different skin types. Considering these shops focus on beauty and skincare products, you will not find food or medicine in their offerings. They are different from mini malls, grocery stores, pharmacies, or drugstores, which typically offer a wide range of products, including food, medicine, and other household items alongside beauty products.

Replace with fresh batteries and then replace the battery compartment face plate. There are several reasons why this option is preferable over the alternative. 1. Battery Removal and Replacement: The key objective in this task is to remove the old batteries and replace them with new ones. In the first option, it suggests replacing the old batteries with \\"spent\\" batteries, which would indicate that they are already depleted. The second option suggests using \\"fresh\\" batteries, ensuring that the keyboard will have the power it needs to function properly.  2. Tools: Although both options mention different kinds of screwdrivers, a small flathead screwdriver is more suitable for prying out batteries gently without causing damage to the battery compartment, springs, contacts, or the batteries themselves. A Phillips screwdriver, with its pointed tip and cross-shaped blade, is specialized for tightening or loosening screws and may not be the best choice for prying batteries out. Using a Phillips screwdriver for that purpose might work, but it could also make the task more difficult, less efficient, or potentially damaging. 3. Process: Both options involve removing the battery compartment face plate, but mentioning this step is essential because it ensures access to the batteries. Not including a description of how to remove the face plate could lead to confusion or incorrect attempts to access the batteries. 4. Clarity: The second option is more clearly written, specifying the use of fresh batteries and which type of screwdriver to use for prying out the old batteries. The first option does not clearly state its intended goal of battery replacement and could lead to further issues with the child's electronic keyboard if spent batteries are used. However, it is essential to note that sometimes the battery compartment on some devices can be removed without the need for tools or, alternatively, using the right size screwdriver for disassembling the battery compartment. It would be best to refer to the specific keyboard user manual for specific instructions or get professional help if necessary. Keep in mind that while performing the task, one must ensure that safety precautions are followed, especially when handling batteries and using tools."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],E={key:0},j={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
