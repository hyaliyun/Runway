Analyze the hypothesis in relation to the premise. 3. Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation. Step 1: Understanding the premise: The premise states that one possible solution for Japan's problem is to assure borrowers of future inflation. In general, inflation leads to an increase in prices of goods and services, which means that borrowing money becomes more attractive as the effective cost of repaying it will be lower in the future due to its decreased value. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis in relation to the premise: The hypothesis is based on the premise and suggests that \\"Japan's problem can simply be solved by assuring borrowers that there will be inflation in the future.\\" This may suggest that creating expectations of future inflation would encourage borrowing, spending, and economic growth. Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the evaluation: While the premise and the hypothesis both focus on the idea of assuring borrowers of future inflation as a potential solution, it's essential to consider other factors that could influence Japan's economic situation (such as government policies, consumer behavior, and global market conditions). Therefore, the hypothesis oversimplifies the potential solution and does not take into account these other factors that may play a role in addressing Japan's problem. Conclusion: Based on the evaluation, my answer is: + no; The hypothesis implies a simple solution to Japan's problem, while in reality, the situation is more complex than just assuring borrowers that there will be inflation in the future."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

After the summer, local festivals practically celebrate the richness of the county every weekend. From Egg Days, Tomato Festival to Seafood Festival, Sonoma County has something for everyone. An event held every year is one of the most special in the area, which celebrates the harvest  of tomatoes, showing over 170 kinds of this tasty fruit. Cooks prepare the most favorite tomato-inspired dishes. You can enjoy all kinds of food while listening to live music, and taste the world famous Kendall Jackson wine. Another great feature of this event is the opportunity to take part in the yearly competition with your own tomatoes. Tomatoes are judged   on looks, taste, and weight and winners will be awarded  . If you're planning on visiting and want to attend this event, get your ticket early as it sells out quickly. This year, to celebrate Tomato Festival, I decided to plant a few tomatoes in a wine barrel   that had kept a lemon tree before. The tree, after about 6 years, finally did not produce fruits anymore, so I changed to plant 3 tomato plants instead. The three wine barrel plants stand over six feet tall and that's above the top of the barrel! They have lots of flowers and some have started to produce fruits. As usual, harvest may be late this year, but the quality of my tomatoes will be excellent. I believe I'll realize my dream of being the best tomato gardener.

Q:Information:  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney.

Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801.

Paragraph: Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

He was treated by a psychiatrist and spent several months in a sanatorium recovering from depression What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","output":"The correctly punctuated version of the sentence is: \\"He was treated by a psychiatrist, and spent several months in a sanatorium, recovering from depression.\\" This sentence maintains the same meaning as the original and conforms to standard English conventions for punctuation usage. The comma after \\"psychiatrist\\" is used to separate two independent clauses that are joined by a coordinating conjunction (\\"and\\"). The second comma, after \\"sanatorium,\\" is used to set off the participial phrase (\\"recovering from depression\\") that provides additional information about the subject's time in the sanatorium. This use of commas enhances readability by indicating natural pauses in the sentence where the speaker would typically pause if the sentence were spoken aloud. Higher-level grammar rules also come into play here. According to some style guides, when you have two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction, you punctuate with a comma. Also, the comma before \\"recovering from depression\\" is known as an \\"offset comma,\\" which is used when the information is nonessential or could be dropped from the sentence without changing its basic meaning. In this case, the fact that he was \\"recovering from depression\\" just adds more color to the statement, but it is not necessary to understand the basic meaning, which is that he was treated by a psychiatrist and spent several months in a sanatorium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While it is true that you could potentially encounter lizards in your garden, on rocks, or in bushes, these environments would only allow you to observe their physical appearance and some aspects of their behavior. To truly learn and understand more about a particular type of lizard, you would need to consult a reliable source of information. Books, especially those written by experts in the field of herpetology (the study of reptiles and amphibians), can provide a wealth of knowledge about different lizard species. Books offer several advantages over other information sources. Firstly, they often contain comprehensive information on various topics. In the case of a book about lizards, you could expect to find detailed descriptions of their physical characteristics, habitats, behaviors, diets, reproduction cycles, and more. Additionally, books are often well-researched and cite multiple references as sources, which lends credibility to the work and ensures that you receive accurate and reliable information. Apart from books, there are other reliable sources of information to learn about a type of lizard: 1. Scientific journals and articles: These resources often provide the latest information on lizard research and discoveries, as they are published by experts in the field. 2. Reputable websites: Many organizations and agencies dedicated to the study of reptiles and amphibians have websites where you can find useful information about lizards. Some examples include the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles (www.ssarherps.org) and the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (www.asih.org). 3. Museums and zoos: These institutions can provide a wealth of information about lizards through exhibits, guided tours, and educational materials. They may also have live specimens, which can give you an opportunity to observe lizards in a controlled environment. 4. Local herpetological societies: Many cities and regions have organizations dedicated to the study and conservation of reptiles and amphibians. Members of these societies can be excellent sources of information on local lizard species, and they may even host events or field trips where you can see lizards in their natural habitat. 5. Online forums and social media groups: There are many online communities where reptile enthusiasts and experts exchange information and share their knowledge about lizards. These platforms can be a great place to ask specific questions and receive advice from experienced individuals. In summary, while observing lizards in their natural habitats, such as gardens, rocks, and bushes, can provide some basic insights into their lives, books and other reliable sources of information offer a far more comprehensive and accurate understanding of lizard species, their behaviors, and their ecological roles. By exploring these resources, you can deepen your knowledge and appreciation of lizards and their fascinating world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Resident ophthalmologist David is in charge of this program. In the first day of the program he checked two patients, patient A and patient B. The test result showed that patient A had Retinitis, but patient B did not have Retinitis. Then next day  David checked two other patients, patient C and patient D. Patient C was 40 years old, but patient D was 80 years old. He found both patient C and D had Retinitis.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   For which patient Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness, patient C or patient D?  Hint: Retinitis is inflammation of the retina in the eye, which can permanently damage the retina and lead to blindness. The retina is the part of your eye that is also known as the \\"sensing tissue.\\" Retinitis may be caused by a number of different infectious agents. Retinitis, also called Retinitis pigmentosa, has a prevalence of one in every 2,500-7,000 people. This condition is one of the leading causes that leads to blindness in patients in the age range of 20–60 years old. A:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness for patient D. This is because the prevalence and propensity of Retinitis as a leading cause of blindness is more commonly observed in patients within the age range of 20-60 years old. Since patient D is 80 years old, they fall outside of that specific age range, so Retinitis would not be considered one of the leading causes of blindness in their case. On the other hand, patient C is 40 years old, which places them within the age range where Retinitis is more likely to be a prominent cause of blindness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Why you may want to reconsider becoming a long-distance landlord By Ilyce Glink and Samuel J. Tamkin August 31 We are currently living in Atlanta in a large single-family home that was built in 2001. We have a mortgage of less than 50 percent of what our home is worth, and we just refinanced to a 5/1 ARM at 2.75 percent interest. Our son is going to be a sophomore in college this coming school year, and we’ve begun to contemplate whether it makes sense to move to a smaller home, maybe even a townhome. Our situation is kind of unique in the sense that we may go back to India after four more years in the United States and then live a hybrid life where we spend eight months in India and four months in the U.S. each year. One idea is to move to a townhome, stay there for three years and then rent it out once we move to India. If we decide to move we’ll need to spend about 25,000 in upgrades. It’s likely the new townhome may also need some upgrades and new appliances. With keeping all the upgrades and expenses in mind, would it make sense to just stay put for the next three to four years in our current house or should we sell and move? With the equity in the house, we may be able to either buy the townhome outright or quickly pay off the small mortgage that we take out for the townhome. You certainly packed a lot of issues in one question. We’ll start with your current home and your current loan. You recently paid several thousand dollars to refinance your loan and you have a great interest rate on that loan. So your housing expenses are probably quite low. We imagine the issue is that your large home has other expenses that would be higher than they would in a smaller home or a townhome. It probably costs more to cool, clean and care for a large home, not to mention paying the property tax bill. As you scale down, your heating and cooling bills should go down as should some of the other expenses of maintaining the home. Financially, it appears you have the income to support staying or going. Given the cost of moving, and the repairs and upgrades you plan to make in both homes, you have to think about which home you’d rather rent: a large family home or a smaller townhouse. [More Matters: How to handle your downstairs condo neighbor who complains about your noisy footsteps] One issue for you to ponder is why you’d want to be a landlord in the United States if you plan to live most of the year in India. If it’s for the investment in real estate, then you have to evaluate the townhome as an investment and determine if having that investment is right for you. Certainly, if you are living in India, you’re not going to be readily available to handle tenant issues or handle the ordinary affairs of owning a piece of real estate. You would need to hire someone to manage the property and handle those issues that you, as a landlord, won’t be able to handle on the other side of the world. If you rent your townhouse (or single-family home), where do you plan to live when you do come back to the United States? From the limited information you have given to us, we don’t know why you would want to go through the expense of handling all the repairs needed to your home only to sell it and then handle all the upgrades and repairs you anticipate in the smaller townhome you might buy. We believe that if you make upgrades and improvements to a home, you might as well stay and enjoy them for a while. If you make those improvements, yes, you’ll have higher expenses in owning your current home. But you’d be smart to calculate what those expenses are relative to the townhome. If the difference isn’t as big as you thought, you might continue to enjoy your home for the next several years. [More Matters: Why purchasing a home at auction can be risky] Of course, as we said, much of your issues are not financially but emotionally driven. So you have to sit down, write down what you like about living in your home, how a move to a different home would affect you, your wife and your son, how it affects your finances and if the effect on your finances is greater than the benefit you get out of keeping the home. If, after you analyze your situation, you find that the financial burden of owning your larger existing home is too great and the benefits to you of having a smaller townhome for the next several years are likely much greater, then consider moving. But we aren’t big fans of buying a townhome now for your future ability to rent it out and become landlords. You’ll need to give that some thought and see if being a landlord is what you really want to be.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality?

To answer these questions, I will provide various methods to potentially increase height, especially for a 14-year-old who may still be growing. Step 1: Analyze the age factor - At the age of 14, a person may still be experiencing growth spurts. It is important to acknowledge that their height will naturally increase as they grow older. Step 2: Recommend healthy nutrition  - Encourage a well-balanced diet, rich in proteins, calcium, vitamins, and minerals. This will support the growth process and the development of strong bones and muscles. Step 3: Suggest regular exercises and sports - Recommend engaging in regular physical activities, especially sports like basketball, swimming, and jumping. These exercises will help strengthen bones, improve posture, and facilitate growth. Step 4: Acknowledge the importance of sleep - Encourage the user to get an adequate amount of sleep, as this is when the body releases growth hormones. Around 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night is ideal for a 14-year-old. Step 5: Address the role of genetics - Inform the user that genetics plays a significant role in determining height, and it is important to set realistic expectations for growth. Step 6: Suggest medical advice - If the user is concerned about their height or thinks there may be an underlying growth issue, they should consult with a medical professional for personalized advice.

The first question asks for lesser-known musical gems from the 1960s, and the second question asks for lesser-known musical gems from the 2000s.

The Zombies - \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (1967): Despite being a critical success, The Zombies' baroque pop masterpiece, \\"Care of Cell 44,\\" never achieved mainstream popularity. 2. Love - \\"Alone Again Or\\" (1967): This beautiful melodic track from the band Love never achieved the same level of popularity as other songs of the time, but it has developed a passionate following among fans of psychedelic rock. 3. Fred Neil - \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" (1966): Originally written and recorded by Fred Neil, this introspective folk song gained more popularity after being covered by Harry Nilsson for the Midnight Cowboy soundtrack. 4. The Pretty Things - \\"S.F. Sorrow\\" (1968): This is the first known concept album in rock history and showcases a haunting and atmospheric soundscape, but it failed to gather the same attention as The Who's \\"Tommy.\\" 5. The Left Banke - \\"Walk Away Renee\\" (1966): A fine example of baroque pop, this beautiful track didn't achieve the same level of success as other songs of the time. Lesser-known musical gems from the 2000s: 1. The Coral - \\"Dreaming of You\\" (2002): A catchy and energetic indie-rock song that showcases this British band's unique style, \\"Dreaming of You\\" is an underappreciated tune from the early 2000s. 2. Stars - \\"Your Ex-Lover is Dead\\" (2004): A beautifully arranged chamber-pop track with hauntingly poetic lyrics, this song from the Canadian band Stars is a clear indication of their talent. 3. Midlake - \\"Roscoe\\" (2006): A folk-rock gem with a beautiful melody and layered harmonies, \\"Roscoe\\" is a prime example of lesser-known brilliance from the indie music scene in the 2000s. 4. The Rapture - \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" (2002): A track that blends punk, funk, and disco in a dynamic and infectious manner, \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" is a genuine testament to the creativity of the post-punk revival in the early 2000s. 5. Aesop Rock - \\"None Shall Pass\\" (2007): This underground hip-hop track features intricate wordplay and dense, vivid storytelling. Aesop Rock's \\"None Shall Pass\\" is an overlooked gem in the world of independent rap. These are just a few examples of the many lesser-known musical treasures from the 1960s and the 2000s.

There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  Would sample D make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?","output":"Sample D, being classified as autotrophic, would make its own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.

But according to a new report, African farmers also have ideas that could help the world fight hunger and poverty. Danielle Nierenberg from the Worldwatch Institute in Washington spent a year visiting twenty-five countries south of the Sahara. In Nairobi, Kenya, for example, Ms Nierenberg found women farmers growing vegetables just outside their doorsteps in the Kibera settlement. She says they are finding ways to make their lives better. The women feed their families and sell their _ They use the money to send their children to school. Last year, about 925,000,000 people worldwide did not get enough to eat. Half of all people in the world now live in and around cities. Researchers like Ms Nierenberg are looking increasingly at creative ideas to feed those who don't have enough good food to eat. She says there are a lot of lessons that people in the Western world can learn from Africa. And what they are doing can certainly be done in other developing countries. Farmers in the developing world lose between twenty and forty percent of their harvest before it ever reaches market. There are many reasons why food gets wasted. Farmers are without electricity and cold storage. They lack good seeds and fertilizer. They lack good roads. Conditions like these keep small farmers in poverty. Ms Nierenberg says more attention needs to be paid to protecting harvests. She says, \\"Given all that we invest in producing food in the first place, we need to devote the same amount of attention to making sure that it is not wasted.\\" In Nigeria, village processing centers are helping farmers reduce their losses and earn more money. They centers process cassava, a root vegetable, into basic food products. In Uganda, the Worldwatch report says some schools are teaching children how to grow local kinds of crops.

He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament. After a period of retirement, he declared for King Charles II of England during a rising in August 1659, and was arrested, but was soon released.

Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which sample would less likely be used as fuel, sample C or sample D? The answer is:","output":"Sample C, which is U-238, is less likely to be used as fuel compared to Sample D, which is U-235. Here's why: U-235 and U-238 are isotopes of uranium. The difference between these isotopes lies in the number of neutrons they have in their atomic nuclei, which further affects some of their physical properties and their utility in various applications. U-235 is a fissile isotope, meaning it can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, making it useful as a fuel in nuclear reactors and also in the production of nuclear weapons. When a neutron hits the nucleus of a U-235 atom, the nucleus splits, releasing a great deal of energy (this is nuclear fission), along with additional neutrons that can then split other U-235 atoms, perpetuating the chain reaction. On the other hand, U-238, the most common isotope of uranium found in nature, is not fissile, it's fertile. It doesn't readily undergo fission, that means it cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the same way. Instead, when hit by neutrons, U-238 becomes U-239, which eventually, through a series of decays, becomes plutonium-239, a fissile material. So in simple terms, U-235 can be used directly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor, while U-238 cannot. However, it's important to note that U-238 can be turned into a usable fuel (Pu-239) through a series of reactions in a reactor. It's just that in its initial state, U-238 is not directly usable as a fuel, hence it is less likely to be used as a fuel in comparison to U-235."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dans certaines situations, les sociétés qui concluent des conventions comportant des actions accréditives peuvent reclasser des montants limités de frais d'aménagement au Canada (habituellement une déduction de 30 % sur un solde décroissant) à titre de frais d'exploration au Canada. Translate to English","output":"In some situations, companies that enter into agreements involving flow-through shares may be allowed to reclassify limited amounts of Canadian development expenses (usually a 30% deduction on a declining balance) as Canadian exploration expenses. Flow-through shares are a unique investment and financing mechanism prevalent in the Canadian resource sector, particularly in the mining and oil and gas industries. They provide companies with a way to transfer eligible expenses to their investors, who can then use these expenses to offset their own taxable income. When a company incurs Canadian development expenses (CDE) or Canadian exploration expenses (CEE), they can usually deduct these costs from their own taxable income. However, by issuing flow-through shares, the company can transfer the right to deduct the eligible expenses to their investors. This can make flow-through shares particularly attractive to investors who have a significant taxable income. As mentioned in the original text, in certain situations, a company may be allowed to reclassify limited amounts of Canadian development expenses as Canadian exploration expenses. This reclassification is generally subject to the company's agreement with the investor and the relevant Canadian tax rules. While both CDE and CEE can provide tax deductions to investors, the CEE offers more favorable tax treatment. Typically, CDE allows for a 30% deduction on a declining balance, while CEE deductions are generally granted on a 100% basis in the year they are incurred. The purpose of allowing such reclassification is to incentivize investment in the exploration and development of the Canadian natural resource sector. By providing more tax advantages to investors, these companies can attract additional capital for their projects, thereby fostering growth in the industry. In summary, the reclassification of limited amounts of Canadian development expenses as Canadian exploration expenses is a possible scenario in certain situations involving flow-through shares. This reclassification typically aims to create a more attractive investment environment for investors, leading to further growth and development in the Canadian resource sector."},{"instruction":"USS Nokomis (SP-609) -  USS Nokomis (SP-609) was a yacht purchased by the U.S. Navy during World War I.

These things come to represent, in fact, what I call joy and love.  I don't remember my father ever getting into a swimming pool. But he did love the water. Any kind of boat ride seemed to give him pleasure. And he loved to fish; sometimes he took me along.  But I never really liked being on the water, the way my father did. I liked being in the water, moving through it, having it all around me. I was not a strong swimmer, or one who learned to swim early, for I had my fears.

The previous record-holders were Ariana Grande's response to the Manchester concert attack (2.7 million likes) and Ellen DeGeneres' iconic Oscar selfie (2.4 million), as reported by the Daily News. Obama's tweet read: \\"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion.\\" The message resonated with millions of people worldwide amidst the escalating racial tension following the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. The tweet's widespread notoriety is a testament to the power of social media as a platform for voicing opinions and sparking change during challenging times.

The Phillies just lost 2 of 3 from the Nationals . Question: Why was the game important ?","output":"The game between the Mets and the Phillies was important for several reasons, each contributing to the heightened anticipation and significance of the matchup. These factors include: 1. Division Standings: The Mets and Phillies are part of the highly competitive National League (NL) East division, where every game counts towards winning the division title and ultimately securing a spot in the playoffs. At the time of the match, three teams were separating the Mets and the Phillies in the standings, making each game crucial in gaining or maintaining a lead in the division race. 2. Previous Encounters: The Mets were coming off a disappointing loss to the Phillies earlier in their road trip, giving them extra motivation to bounce back and prove their worth in this three-game set. A strong showing against the Phillies would be essential in recovering from the prior defeat and demonstrating their resilience. 3. Momentum and Confidence: The Mets had recently completed a successful 6-2 road trip, which included a sweep of the Brewers and a four-game winning streak leading up to the match against the Phillies. A victory in this important game would help the Mets maintain their positive momentum and boost their confidence for the remainder of the season. On the other hand, the Phillies had just lost 2 of 3 games to the Nationals, making it crucial for them to regain their footing and prevent further setbacks. 4. Breathing Room in the NL East: As mentioned earlier, the NL East is a highly competitive division, and every win or loss has a significant impact on the standings. A victory for either the Mets or the Phillies in this crucial series would provide some much-needed breathing room regarding their position in the division, potentially making it easier to sustain a lead or make a late-season push for a playoff berth. 5. Player Performance and Roster Decisions: In games of such magnitude, individual players' performances can have significant implications for the team's overall success. Strong outings by key players can solidify their positions in the starting lineup or pitching rotation, while underperforming players may find themselves replaced by trade deadline acquisitions or candidates for demotion. These high-stakes games can serve as essential evaluation opportunities for team management. 6. Fan and Media Attention: Given the rivalry and the significance of this three-game set in the division race, considerable fan and media attention surrounded the matchup. Winning such high-profile games can generate positive buzz for the team, enhance fan engagement, and improve overall morale in the clubhouse. To summarize, the game between the Mets and the Phillies was important due to its implications on division standings, the need to maintain momentum and confidence, the opportunity to gain breathing room in the NL East race, the impact on player performance and roster decisions, and the attention and excitement generated amongst fans and the media. As such, the outcome of this game and the subsequent series had far-reaching effects on the teams' prospects for the remainder of the season and beyond."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Read this: To the southwest, the principality of Halych had developed trade relations with its Polish, Hungarian and Lithuanian neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, Prince Roman Mstislavich united the two previously separate principalities. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of Grand Duke of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, Prince Daniil (r. 1238–1264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \\"Rex Rusiae\\" (\\"King of Russia\\") from the Roman papacy, apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople granted the King of Poland a metropolitan for his Russian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. Cyprian, a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \\"Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and all Rus'\\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule. Who did not unit the two principalities?

(CNN) -- Scientists say they have proven the existence of the Higgs boson -- a never-before-seen subatomic particle long thought to be a fundamental building block of the universe. Since 2012 researchers have made great strides in the hunt for the so-called \\"God particle\\" at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, where scientists at the CERN particle physics laboratory are looking for particles that slip into existence when subatomic particles crash into one another at high energies. Experts say finding the elusive particle would rank as one of the top scientific achievements of the past 50 years -- a view proved on Tuesday when Francois Englert and Peter Higgs, the two physicists who predicted almost 50 years ago that the particle existed, won the Nobel Prize in Physics. \\"Only now with the LHC [ OPTIONS: - CERN] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - CNN] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Francois Englert] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Geneva] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - God] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Higgs boson] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Large Hadron Collider] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Nobel Prize in Physics] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Peter Higgs] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" - Switzerland] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\"","output":"Large Hadron Collider] are we able to really tick that box off and say 'This is how the universe works, or at least we think it does'.\\" The discovery of the Higgs boson has provided key insights into the nature of the universe and could help physicists understand other fundamental questions like the nature of dark matter and the origins of the universe itself. The Higgs field, associated with the Higgs boson, is believed to give particles mass through interaction with this invisible field. \\"The Higgs boson has long been considered the missing cornerstone of our understanding of the universe, and now we can finally confirm that it indeed exists,\\" said CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer. \\"This is an incredible achievement for science, and it has only been possible through the collaboration of researchers from around the world working together on the Large Hadron Collider project.\\" This monumental discovery could not have happened without the tireless efforts of thousands of researchers and engineers working together at CERN. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a 17-mile-long underground ring, is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world. By smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light, scientists have been able to observe high-energy collisions that release particles like the Higgs boson. The confirmation of the Higgs boson's existence not only validates the current understanding of particle physics, the so-called Standard Model, but it also opens up new avenues for further research. The discovery has the potential to pave the way for advancements in technology, medicine, and possibly even new sources of energy in the future. As impressive as this discovery is, it must be remembered that our understanding of the universe is continually evolving. Physicists are now focusing on studying the Higgs boson in more detail to gain deeper insights into how it interacts with other particles and possibly uncover more undiscovered particles. This could eventually lead to the development of new theories that challenge and refine our knowledge of the universe's inner workings. In conclusion, the discovery of the Higgs boson is a significant milestone in human history and has major implications for our understanding of the universe. The completion of this news story with 'Large Hadron Collider' emphasizes the importance of the cutting-edge technology and international collaboration that made this monumental discovery possible. Ultimately, the study of the Higgs boson will continue to propel the field of particle physics forward, enabling us to unravel the mysteries of the universe we inhabit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Detailed Instructions: Given a scientific question, generate a correct answer to it. Problem:If a human only has 45 chromosomes it is most likely due to a mistake during what? Solution:","output":"If a human only has 45 chromosomes, it is most likely due to a mistake during the process of meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division responsible for the production of sex cells (sperm and eggs) in sexually reproducing organisms. During meiosis, the normal chromosome number (46 in humans) is halved, resulting in haploid cells with 23 chromosomes each. These haploid cells later combine during fertilization to form a diploid zygote with the full complement of 46 chromosomes. A person with 45 chromosomes likely has a condition called monosomy, which occurs when a chromosome is missing from one of the pairs in an otherwise diploid set of chromosomes. This can result from errors during one of the two main stages of meiosis, known as meiosis I and meiosis II. 1. Meiosis I: This stage starts with a diploid (2n) cell that undergoes DNA replication, resulting in duplicated chromosomes (each consisting of two identical sister chromatids). The chromosomes then pair up with their homologous partners, forming tetrads. Through a process called crossing over, the homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, increasing genetic diversity. Subsequently, the homologous chromosome pairs are separated, and the cell divides into two haploid (n) daughter cells, each with 23 duplicated chromosomes. An error during meiosis I might result in non-disjunction, which occurs when homologous chromosomes (or sister chromatids) fail to separate correctly. If this happens, one of the resulting daughter cells might receive an extra chromosome, leaving the other with one less. 2. Meiosis II: During this stage, the haploid daughter cells from meiosis I go through a second round of cell division. The chromatids of each chromosome are separated, resulting in the formation of four haploid (n) cells, each with 23 single-stranded chromosomes. These cells will ultimately become sperm or egg cells. Errors during meiosis II can also lead to non-disjunction, causing an uneven distribution of chromosomes in the resulting gametes. If a gamete missing a chromosome subsequently participates in fertilization, the resulting zygote will have only 45 chromosomes. This can lead to various health issues and developmental abnormalities, depending on which chromosome is affected."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.  - Michael Emile \\"Mikey\\" Craig (born 15 February 1960) is an English musician and DJ, best known as a bassist of the 1980s pop group Culture Club.  - George Alan O'Dowd (born 14 June 1961), known professionally as Boy George, is an English singer, songwriter, DJ, fashion designer and photographer. He is the lead singer of the Grammy and Brit Award-winning pop band Culture Club. At the height of the band's fame, during the 1980s, they recorded global hit songs such as \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\" and \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and George is known for his soulful voice and androgynous appearance. He was part of the English New Romantic movement which emerged in the late 1970s to the early 1980s.  - Jonathan \`\` Jon '' Aubrey Moss is an English drummer , best known as a member of the 1980s pop group Culture Club . He has also played with other bands , including London , The Nips , The Damned and Adam & The Ants .  - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material.  - Culture Club are an English band that was formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million records worldwide, including 13 million records in the United States.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Marching percussion instruments are specially designed to be played while moving. This is achieved by attaching the drum(s) to a special harness (also called a carrier or rack) worn by the drummer, although not all marching bands use such harnesses and instead use traditional baldrics to sling their drums (the British Armed Forces, for instance, still use the old style of slung drums). The drums are designed and tuned for maximum articulation and projection of sound, as marching activities are almost always outdoors or in large interior spaces. Articulation is paramount to producing a \\"clean\\" sound from all the drummers in the line. These instruments are used by marching bands, drum and bugle corps, indoor percussion ensembles, and pipe bands. A marching percussion ensemble is frequently known as a drumline or battery.

In today's technologically advanced world, the traditional method of writing reports by hand has become less common. Instead, people use computers and electronic devices to create documents more efficiently, and these digital documents are often printed using a computer printer.  Although other options mentioned like the office supply store, classroom, typewriter, and artist's studio all involve paper usage, they are not directly related to how the majority of people generate and print reports in the modern context. An office supply store sells various items necessary for offices and businesses, including paper and printer supplies. However, people generally do not write or print reports directly at the supply store.  A classroom is a learning environment where students and teachers engage in educational activities. While students may use paper to take notes or complete assignments, the classroom itself does not print reports. However, schools and educational institutions may have computer labs or printing facilities available for students to print documents as needed. A typewriter is an old-fashioned device used to type letters and documents. While it can also produce written reports on paper, very few people use typewriters nowadays due to the prevalence of computers and digital technology. An artist's studio is a space where artists create their artwork. These individuals may use paper for drawing, painting, or creating other types of art pieces. However, this setting is not typically associated with generating and printing reports or other business-related documents. Conclusively, the best answer is a computer printer since it accurately represents the primary method through which people create and print reports in the digital age.

The CIA's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well, problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize. One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA disagreed. Second, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator.\\" This was new ground,\\"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions: What is the chain of command? Who takes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military command and control? Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA, he and the Agency's executive director, A. B.\\" Buzzy\\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he. Third, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work. It had been built to hit tanks, not people. It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle.

Media playback is not supported on this device The £30m showdown between the former sparring partners has been dubbed a fight for \\"the history books\\" by Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn. It will be expected to sell roughly a million times on pay-per-view television in the UK, is being broadcast in Germany and has achieved a rare feat in the US market as rival broadcasters Showtime and HBO will both transmit the bout. \\"Only twice before have they done it - Lennox Lewis versus Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao,\\" said Hearn. Klitschko has already fought in the US a dozen times but Joshua, who looks destined to follow the likes of Lewis into US-based super bouts, is yet to fight professionally outside of the UK. \\"He has the ultimate test,\\" added Hearn.  \\"A test which should come maybe after 27 or 28 fights. Why risk it now? He wants to challenge himself. Is he the guy everyone talks about as the future of boxing?\\" Joshua's procession to a world title - captured in just 34 career rounds when he floored American Charles Martin in 2016 - has led to him being installed as odds-on-favourite against Klitschko with bookmakers. He has contested just 44 rounds as a professional, a tally surpassed by Klitschko in his last five fights alone, with the 41-year-old Ukrainian hardened by 358 rounds as a pro, spanning 68 fights, 64 wins and more than 20 years. Indeed, London 2012 gold medallist Joshua was only six when Klitschko topped the podium at the 1996 Atlanta Games. In the pro game, he has felt the heat of a world title fight three times, this will be Klitschko's 29th. With both men similar in stature, the gap in age and experience has been central to much of the pre-fight debate. Joshua's trainer Rob McCracken said: \\"As good as Klitschko has been, Father Time is a terrible person when he shows up and I think he already has. \\"It is going to be tough for Wladimir, he doesn't know himself if it's still there or not.

His tally of 53 knockouts surpasses the great Joe Louis by one and the wrecking ball that was Mike Tyson by nine. In 2013, he dropped the respected Alexander Povetkin four times. The Russian had never lost and has not done so since. Klitschko is adamant his career will not fade after defeat to Fury and he has come back from torment before after losing world title fights to the likes of Corrie Sanders in 2003 and Lamon Brewster a year later. \\"Nobody is perfect,\\" Klitschko's brother Vitali told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"Everyone has strong sides and weak sides.

Even a bad old Wladimir should be enough to beat this kid Anthony Joshua. The worst Wladimir you've seen win a 12-round stinking fight should be enough. I think an awful lot has been placed on the assumption, the dream, hope, that Wladimir, at 41 has nothing left. If that's not the case then we are in for a tricky night. While Joshua's social media offerings have showcased chats with celebrities such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and American rap artist Dr. Dre in recent weeks, footage of his gruelling training regime has also been free flowing. Reaction drills such as dodging agility sticks to chase tennis balls, intense sessions on a watt bike and workouts in a leg-sapping sand pit have all been captured on camera. The hard work calls for a diet of between 4,000 and 5,000 calories a day - a stark difference to NHS guidelines of 2,500 for men. Smoothies form a key part of his diet in order to increase his calorie intake and replace fluids lost when sweating, as it is not uncommon for Joshua to lose 3kg through sweat alone during a session. So if you want to start your Saturday in the same way the champion begins a training day, opt for a healthy smoothie, workout and then follow up with as many as five eggs on wholemeal bread.

May 20, 2014, 11:42 PM GMT / Updated May 21, 2014, 12:00 AM GMT      Five men were convicted Tuesday in Moscow in the 2006 execution-style murder of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Russian state media reported.      Politkovskaya, a crusading reporter for the liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta who worked almost full-time on documenting allegations of human rights violations in the breakaway province of Chechnya, was 48 when she was gunned down in the elevator of her apartment building in October 2006.      The murder raised worldwide questions about freedom of speech and of the press under Russian President Vladimir Putin — especially after three of the defendants were initially acquitted in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned those acquittals and ordered a new trial. ||||| People hold portraits of slain journalist Anna Politkovskaya on the sixth anniversary of her death, next to her block of flats in central Moscow October 7, 2012.      MOSCOW (Reuters) - Five men were convicted on Tuesday of murdering 2006 of investigative journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya, including three defendants who had been acquitted in a previous trial.      Politkovskaya's killing drew attention to the risks faced by Russians who challenge the authorities and deepened Western concerns for the rule of law under President Vladimir Putin, who was then serving his second term.      Another jury's 2009 acquittal of three of the men who were found guilty of murder on Tuesday embarrassed Russian prosecutors and was later thrown out by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial.      The defendants were three Chechen brothers, one of whom was accused of shooting Politkovskaya in the lobby of her Moscow apartment building on October 7, 2006, as well as their uncle and a former police officer.      The convictions are a victory for Russian prosecutors and the state, but rights activists and relatives of Politkovskaya say that justice will not be done until those who ordered her contract-style killing are identified and convicted.      \\"The murder will only be solved when the name of the person who ordered it is known,\\" a lawyer for Politkovskaya's family, Anna Stavitskaya, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.      She welcomed the jury's verdict but said the men found guilty \\"are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice\\", RIA reported.      A spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said the authorities were doing all they can to identify and track down the person behind the killing, Russian news agencies reported.      Kremlin critics say they doubt that will ever happen because of suspicions the trail could lead too close to the government.      Politkovskaya, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta who was 48 when she was shot dead while returning home after shopping for groceries, was best known for her dogged reporting on human rights violations in the North Caucasus province of Chechnya.      Lawyers for the defendants - Rustam Makhmudov, his brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail, their uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov - said they would appeal.      Investigators say Gaitukayev organised the logistics of the killing while in jail for another matter, while Khadzhikurbanov was in charge of preparing for the slaying and Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov helped track her.      Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and Khadzhikurbanov were previously acquitted.      The five men will be sentenced by a judge at a later date and could face life in prison. Prosecutors will recommend sentences at a court session on Wednesday, RIA reported.

One man was found guilty of the shooting and the other four of organising the killing. Three of the men were brothers from Chechnya.      Ms Politkovskaya, a 48-year-old investigative reporter and vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, was shot in a lift in her block of flats.      Three of the men had been acquitted of the murder in a 2009 trial.      The initial verdict was overturned by Russia's supreme court, which ordered their retrial.      One of the brothers, Rustam Makhmudov, was found guilty of pulling the trigger. His brothers were found guilty of acting as getaway drivers.      The brothers' uncle and a retired policeman were also found guilty of organising the killing.      Ms Politkovskaya's reporting for Novaya Gazeta newspaper won international renown for her dogged investigation of Russian abuses in Chechnya.      But her pieces, which were highly critical of President Vladimir Putin, then serving his second term, and the Chechen leadership, angered many in authority.      The five men, who face possible life terms, will be sentenced on Wednesday morning.      A committee set up to investigate the shooting said it was still looking for the person who ordered the operation.      Her family welcomed the verdict but also expressed disappointment that the mastermind of the killing had not yet been found.      Last year a former police officer, Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for supplying the murder weapon.      Magnitsky sanctions      In a separate development, the US announced on Tuesday that it was imposing sanctions on a further 12 Russians believed to be involved in the death of a Moscow lawyer in 2009.      Sergei Magnitsky found evidence of a 230m tax-refund fraud      Sergei Magnitsky died in prison, allegedly because of torture and neglect, after accusing Russian officials of tax fraud.      Following his death, the US passed the Magnitsky Act, aimed at punishing officials involved in his death, and last year published a list of 18 individuals banned from entering the country.      Among the names added to the list on Tuesday are three doctors alleged to have withheld treatment from Magnitsky while he was in custody.      One of them, Larisa Litvinova, was chief physician at Butyrka maximum security jail where Magnitksy died while another, Dmitry Kratov, was its deputy director.      A judge involved in a posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky for tax fraud has also been added to the sanctions list.      The US says the sanctions are \\"independent of Russia's actions in Ukraine\\". |||||","output":"Five men were found guilty of killing a journalist named Anna Politkovskaya in 2006.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: [ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Now, I have a new situation: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches.  Answer this question please: Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches? A:","output":"Given the background information provided, apples retained their quality longer than peaches. This is because apples were among the fruits Dan decided to candy, while peaches were left fresh for the family to enjoy.  Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, undergoes a process of preservation where the fruit is placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. This process can take from several days to several months, depending on the size and type of fruit, and allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure this creates. Since the apples were candied and the peaches were left fresh, the preservation process extended the shelf life of the apples. Fresh fruits, such as peaches in this case, don't undergo the same preservation process and thus will not last as long as their candied counterparts. Fresh fruits will generally last a few days to a couple of weeks at most, depending on how they are stored. Consequently, the candied apples retained their quality longer than the fresh peaches."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Teddy Bears have been a very popular children's toy for many years. Most adults can remember their first stuffed bear, and over the decades these toys have become nearly a symbol of their childhood. However, children are not the only ones with whom these toys have become popular, as many adults make it a habit to collect these toys as well. The Teddy Bear first became popular during the early 20th century and was associated with then President Theodore Roosevelt. The story can date back to a hunting trip that President Roosevelt had taken where he was invited to be the one to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree. Being a crazy outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the animal because he believed that shooting the helpless bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong. This story quickly spread through newspapers across the country, and in the end inspired the introduction of a stuffed toy called \\"Teddy's bear\\". These toys became popular soon after first introduced, and within ten years, they were being produced by dozens of companies around the world. Within a generation, these stuffed bears were \\"the\\" toy to have, and have always been within children's toy boxes ever since. They are most often mass-produced in factories in order to keep up with the high demand.  However, there are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones. Today, these bears and other similar toys generate well over a billion dollars a year in profits for the companies that make them. Walk through just about any toy store in America and you will find dozens of different teddy bears lining the shelves. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Answer: A:","output":"The passage is mainly about the history, popularity, and enduring significance of Teddy Bears as children's toys and collectibles for adults.

The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio.

And I was wondering What does Casey need to do before this? Answer:","output":"Before attending a drag festival wearing men's underwear, Casey should take the following steps to ensure they are well-prepared and comfortable for the event: 1. Choose the right underwear: Select men's underwear that fits well and provides the desired level of support. Consider the style, size, and material of the underwear – boxers, briefs, or trunks, for example. 2. Pick an appropriate outfit: Plan the overall outfit for the festival, keeping in mind the possible dress code and the specific theme or style of the event. The outfit should complement the underwear style, be comfortable, and allow for easy movement. 3. Practice personal hygiene: Shower and groom thoroughly, paying special attention to areas that can hold odor, such as the groin area. Apply deodorant or antiperspirant and consider using body powder for added comfort and moisture control. 4. Tuck or pad, if necessary: Depending on Casey's preferred presentation at the drag festival, they might choose to tuck their genitals for a smoother appearance, or may want to use additional padding for a more authentic masculine look. If tucking, use appropriate methods and materials like medical tape or gaffs—practice beforehand to ensure comfort and avoid any complications during the event. 5. Get ready: Apply makeup and style hair as desired, in accordance with the chosen look for the drag festival. Make sure the makeup used is long-lasting and of good quality to withstand the duration of the event. 6. Pack essentials: In a small bag, pack essentials such as ID, cash or credit cards, mobile phone, and any required medications. Additionally, consider carrying makeup essentials for touch-ups, as well as a change of clothes and underwear. 7. Research the event: Familiarize yourself with the venue, schedule, and the lineup to make the most of the drag festival experience. 8. Connect with friends: Coordinate with friends attending the event to share in the fun and create a safe and supportive environment. 9. Be open and respectful: Attend the festival with an open mind, engage with others, and celebrate the diverse range of talents and performances. Be respectful of everyone in the community, use proper pronouns, and ask for others' pronouns if unsure. By taking these steps, Casey can ensure they are well-prepared and can enjoy a fun and memorable experience at the drag festival."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In ‘Godzilla,’ San Francisco is in for a big surprise Director Gareth Edwards got the challenging assignment to update Godzilla on the strength of his 2010 debut, “Monsters,” a less-is-more indie that showed that marauding behemoths could actually still be scary. As Edwards also demonstrated, this was particularly true when the human drama was strong enough to make us care. “Godzilla” skillfully applies the same dynamic — for a stretch. This latest bid to Hollywoodize a uniquely Japanese icon is an uneven spectacle that can’t sustain its solid first-half character moments. But the movie can also flash a surprising, often clever sense of legacy, and is intermittently capable of thrilling us. The film opens by establishing, emphatically, that the character’s still relevant origins as a nuclear-anxiety metaphor haven’t been forgotten. It’s 1999. Exacting, Japan-based engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is sweating reactor issues — apparently with good cause, as some seismic anomaly (guess what?) triggers a meltdown. It ends badly for Joe’s engineer wife (Juliette Binoche), in a scene that’s the high point of some absorbing early drama — Edwards again flexing his tonal muscles, and delivering the movie that audiences seemingly craved when 1998’s size-does-matter “Godzilla” tanked. Fifteen years later, the couple’s grown son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of “Kick-Ass,” all hunky concern and practiced city-tough accent), is an Army bomb-squad specialist living in San Francisco. Determined to lead a normal life with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and his own young son, Ford has stashed his family tragedy in the hurt locker (sorry). But he’s exasperatedly pulled back in by Joe, who’s still in Japan and playing conspiracy nut, in a nice variation on Walter White’s dark metamorphic spiral. Joe’s suspicions are proven right, of course, as a mysterious cocoon cracks open at the reactor site-turned-research facility, and the creature-feature mayhem finally gets underway. Spoiler alert: The monster that busts loose isn’t Godzilla, but some species of fanged, EMP-spouting locust — or maybe a neo-Rodan, to fanboys — that the movie showcases as fondly as its star. Still, the scramble for containment soon alerts scientists (Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins) and the military (David Strathairn, sporting a brush cut) to Godzilla’s presence as well. So begins an odyssey of tracking the creatures, first to Honolulu, then inexorably on to San Francisco, with Taylor-Johnson’s hero leading the way. Bomb tech, crack shot, paratrooper — he’s a super-er super solider than Captain America. Meanwhile, a second, frisky quasi-locust begins making its way there, from Nevada nuclear-disposal territory, via Las Vegas. Efficient planning when you want to trash Paris, New York-New York, and a pyramid, in addition to the Golden Gate. Crafted with motion-capture technology and an aesthetic eye toward tradition, Godzilla is convincingly rendered here, making for some genuinely electrifying moments. There’s the monster’s battleship-buffeting partial reveal. That initial footfall, and the way it instantly communicates the Godzilla’s impossible scale. That initial blast of his radioactive dragon’s-breath, and a stunning encore. You take in these moments, and you imagine this must be what it felt like to catch the original at a Saturday matinee in the 1950s. Still, the third-act brawl between Godzilla and the other two kaiju titans is overkill, a case of Edwards’s budget-necessitated “Monsters” restraint getting chucked right out. It’s interesting that Edwards honors Godzilla’s history to the point that he’s even willing to mine the character’s post-’50s reinvention as fearsome protector. But the more the movie indulges this aspect, the more it really needs performances that ground it — and they’re just not coming from Taylor-Johnson, Watanabe, and the rest of the thespian soldiers and flabbergasted biologists who dominate the second hour. Godzilla, Watanabe breathlessly hypothesizes, “is here to restore balance.” The film could do with a little of that itself, thrills notwithstanding. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"\\"Godzilla\\" is a movie about a big monster who causes problems in San Francisco. The movie starts with an engineer named Joe who has problems in 1999. Later, his son Ford tries to have a normal life but has to help his dad when more trouble starts.

Gases, such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), or hydrogen sulfide (H2S), termed gasotransmitters, play an increasingly important role in understanding of how electrical signaling of cells is modulated. H2S is well-known to act on various ion channels and receptors. In a previous study we reported that H2S increased calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel activity.', 'The goal of the present study is to investigate the modulatory effect of BK channel phosphorylation on the action of H2S on the channel as well as to recalculate and determine the H2S concentrations in aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) solutions.', 'Single channel recordings of GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells were used to analyze channel open probability, amplitude, and open dwell times. H2S was measured with an anion selective electrode.', 'The concentration of H2S produced from NaHS was recalculated taking pH, temperature salinity of the perfusate, and evaporation of H2S into account. The results indicate that from a concentration of 300 μM NaHS, only 11-13%, i.e., 34-41 μM is effective as H2S in solution. GH3, GH4, and GH4 STREX cells respond differently to phosphorylation. BK channel open probability (Po) of all cells lines used was increased by H2S in ATP-containing solutions. PKA prevented the action of H2S on channel Po in GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not in GH3 cells. H2S, high significantly increased Po of all PKG pretreated cells. In the presence of PKC, which lowers channel activity, H2S increased channel Po of GH4 and GH4 STREX, but not those of GH3 cells.

They both made great progress.  Which person didn't observe that the climate becomes colder at high elevations?  Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. A:","output":"In this scenario, Jerry studies alpine climate, which is characterized by the climate becoming colder at high elevations. This is described by the lapse rate of air, where air tends to get colder as it rises due to expansion. On the other hand, James studies tropical climates, which are characterized by hot, humid weather and relatively consistent temperatures throughout the year, with less variation associated with elevation changes. Given the information provided and the hint that alpine climate involves the climate becoming colder at high elevations, it is clear that James, the meteorologist studying tropical climates, did not observe the phenomenon that the climate becomes colder at high elevations.

Article:Kingfisher has confirmed to the market that the €275m (£200m) deal, first announced last year, would not proceed. The company already owns the Castorama chain in France and the deal depended on regulatory approval. It emerged last week that some Mr Bricolage shareholders opposed the deal. Shares in Kingfisher rose 3.1%, or 11.1p, to 368.9p in afternoon trading in London, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. The company is worth more than £8.5bn. ANPF, an organisation controlled by Mr Bricolage franchisees that holds almost 42% of the retailer's shares, last week decided to oppose the deal. Kingfisher had set a deadline of 31 March for regulatory approval of the takeover. \\"Notwithstanding Kingfisher's efforts to pursue the completion of the transaction, and in light of the positions expressed to date by the ANPF and Mr Bricolage, the anti-trust clearance will not be obtained by 31 March 2015 and therefore the July 2014 agreement will lapse on that date,\\" the company said on Monday. \\"Consequently the transaction will not proceed. Kingfisher is considering all of its options.\\" Some Mr Bricolage franchisees are understood to fear the store closures that would be required for Kingfisher to win regulatory approval of the takeover. The failure of the deal is a blow to Veronique Laury, the former Castorama boss who took over from Sir Ian Cheshire as chief executive last September. She will preside over her first set of annual results for Kingfisher on Tuesday. Andrew Hughes, a UBS analyst, expects pre-tax profits to be 10% lower than 2013 at £670m. Challenges facing Ms Laury include reducing the amount of floorspace occupied by B&Q stores and generating further growth in Europe following the collapse of the Mr Bricolage deal. In December, the company said it would sell a 70% stake in B&Q China, which has 39 stores and more than 3,000 staff, for £140m. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Kingfisher, a British multinational retail company, has confirmed that its £200m deal to acquire French home improvement retailer Mr. Bricolage will not proceed as planned. The failure of the deal comes as a result of opposition from some Mr. Bricolage shareholders and the inability to obtain the necessary regulatory approval by the set deadline of 31 March 2015. Kingfisher already owns the French Castorama chain, and the deal depended on regulatory approval. The failed deal poses challenges for Kingfisher's new CEO, Veronique Laury, who now faces the tasks of reducing B&Q store floorspace and generating further growth in Europe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This small city is located in the northeastern part of the state and was chosen due to its rural landscape, architecture, and suitable locations that matched the fictional setting of the film, Calumet, Colorado. The city's picturesque scenery and historic buildings allowed the production to create a believable small-town atmosphere for the movie. Various specific locations in and around Las Vegas, New Mexico, were used during the filming, including: 1. Las Vegas Plaza: The Las Vegas Plaza was used for several outdoor scenes, including the iconic opening sequence where paratroopers descend onto the streets and the high school kids witness the invasion. 2. Fourth Street Bridge: The Fourth Street Bridge is a prominent location featured in the movie. In one of the most famous scenes, the iconic 'Wolverines!' battle cry is shouted by the film’s lead characters. 3. West Las Vegas High School: Formerly known as Robertson High School, this location was used for both exterior and interior shots of the school. The building can still be spotted today and is easily recognizable from the film. 4. Hermanos Lopez Ranch: Located about 25 miles from Las Vegas, this ranch served as the location for the fictional guerrilla training camp used by the main characters in the movie. 5. Gallinas River: Scenes involving the Gallinas River were filmed on location, particularly those depicting the main characters' life in hiding, and their crossing of the river. 6. Fox Peak Gas Station: This old gas station was used in the scene where a Russian tank stops, and the characters attempt to obtain fuel. 7. Storrie Lake State Park: Located about 5 miles north of Las Vegas, Storrie Lake State Park was utilized for shooting some of the outdoor scenes featuring the main characters' guerrilla activities, such as the sabotage of the gas station. 8. Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park: Situated in Angel Fire, New Mexico, around 55 miles northeast of Las Vegas, this park was used for filming the climax of the movie and the scene where American Colonel Tanner meets the \\"Wolverines.\\" Overall, the locations in and around Las Vegas, New Mexico, allowed the film's production to create a convincing portrayal of a small-town USA invaded and occupied by foreign forces. The area's rural setting, diverse landscapes, and blend of historic and modern buildings provided the perfect backdrop for the movie's fictional narrative. To this day, some of the filming locations used in the original \\"Red Dawn\\" remain recognizable and attract visitors who are fans of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of this story, Carol Field is probably A:","output":"an expert in Italian baking and the author of The Italian Baker, a favorite baking book for Italian specialties. She shares a bit of history behind the origins of the colomba, a traditional Italian Easter bread that is fluffy, sweet, and shaped like a dove. Through her research and sharing of the story, Field helps ensure the continuation of this cherished Italian tradition at Easter tables across Italy and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Leeds president Massimo Cellino arrived back in the United Kingdom in defiant mood on Tuesday and told the Football League it had 'made a big mistake' in disqualifying him from owning the club. Cellino was holding talks in Bahrain with the club's former owner Gulf Finance House - the investment bank still control 25 per cent of the club's shares - when the Football League announced on Monday the Italian had failed its 'owners and directors' test'. The league told Cellino he must stand down after finally receiving further evidence of dishonesty from the Italian judge who convicted him for tax evasion in March. Massimo Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park back in September. It was all quiet outside Elland Road on Monday as the statements were released. Hollywood actor Verne Troyer (centre) poses with Cellino's daughter Eleonora at Elland Road on Saturday. The 58-year-old will be entitled to return to his position at the club on March 18 next year when the conviction is spent under UK law. The league has said Cellino had 14 days to lodge an appeal. 'I don't want to spend a lot of money on lawyers,' Cellino told ITV. 'This club in the last five years has spent more money on lawyers than players.' When asked to confirm he will appeal, Cellino said: 'Sure. I'm going to meet my lawyers. They (Football League) have made a big mistake. 'They're just throwing money from the window.' Cellino took control of Leeds in April when his family company, Eleanora Sport Limited, bought 75 per cent of the club's shares from GFH. The former Cagliari owner announced a new £20million investment in Leeds on Saturday and said he had successfully negotiated a £5million contribution from GFH after meeting with the investment bank's officials in Bahrain. The statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner stands proud outside the famous old ground. Leeds' players celebrate Mirco Antenucci's strike in the 2-1 win over league leaders Derby on Saturday. We have today received a notice from the Football League disqualifying Mr Cellino from being a director of Leeds United Football Club until March 18 2015. The club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision. In the interim, the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the Football League’s Professional Conduct Committee in April 2014. The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party. Cellino added: 'I solved a big problem (on Monday) in Bahrain. It was important for the survival of this club. This club now is financially strong, it looks to the future and we're going to present the facts. 'We're going to fix the club and the league is going to realise it's doing a big mistake.' The league initially attempted to block Cellino's takeover of Leeds after his tax conviction in April, but the Italian successfully appealed. But the judge who over-ruled the league's decision, Tim Kerr QC, said if it was later concluded that Cellino had acted dishonestly when failing to pay import duty on his yacht, he would fail the 'owners' and directors' test'. Cellino faces a second similar charge of tax evasion on another yacht. The latest court case in Sardinia was adjourned in late October and it is understood a new date has yet to be confirmed. The league has also asked an independent disciplinary commission to consider whether Cellino breached league regulations by not disclosing information it had obtained from the Sardinian court which convicted him in March. Press Association Sport understands there is no time limit on the commission's findings as this further breach of its rules is an entirely separate process. It is also understood that Eleanora Sport could install a new management structure at Elland Road to satisfy the league that Cellino has no financial or executive influence on the club during his disqualification period. The Board of Directors of The Football League has, once again, considered the position of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, under its Owners' and Directors' Test. Previously (March 2014), the Board had ruled that Mr Cellino was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat (which resulted in him being fined €600,000). In April 2014, this decision was successfully appealed by Mr Cellino at a hearing of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by an independent QC (sitting alone). In reaching his verdict, Tim Kerr QC concluded that: “Mr Cellino has satisfied me that on the facts before me, what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.” Before going on to state that: “if the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses that the conduct of Mr Cellino was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would become subject to a Disqualifying Condition.” Cellino watches Leeds take on QPR back in March before his takeover had been completed. At its meeting last week, the Board considered the reasoned Judgment of the Italian Court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian Courts for its full disclosure. The Board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously (with the exception of its Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest*) that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test. Mr Cellino is entitled to appeal the Board's decision to the PCC within 14 days. As the Judgment of the Italian Court has not been published in Italy, The Football League will not make any of its contents public. Additionally, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent Football Disciplinary Commission (FDC) to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course. Editors notes:. * Shaun Harvey was Chief Executive and a Director of Leeds United between 2004 and 2013. Cellino is pictured at Millwall back in August. He has sacked two managers since then.

Movie title: Cape Fear Context: Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) is a lawyer in the quiet town of New Essex, North Carolina. Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, vowing to have Bowden disbarred. Kersek reasons that Cady may try... Answer:","output":"In the movie Cape Fear, Max Cady (Robert De Niro), the antagonist, files a restraining order against Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), the protagonist. This happens after Bowden, the lawyer who once defended Cady and buried evidence against him, attempts to have Cady arrested due to his ongoing harassment of the Bowden family. However, the police are unable to find any evidence of a crime. As the harassment continues, Bowden is pushed to the edge and hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. After several incidents, Bowden confronts Cady and warns him to leave his family alone or face consequences. Unbeknownst to Bowden, Cady secretly records this conversation using a hidden device. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat, along with an exaggerated display of his own injuries from an earlier altercation, to file a restraining order against Bowden. Cady's new lawyer, Lee Heller (Gregory Peck), then files a complaint with the North Carolina State Bar, seeking to have Bowden disbarred. In this situation, Max Cady files the restraining order against Sam Bowden to further complicate the situation and make it difficult for Bowden to act against him. This restraining order is a strategic move by Cady in his ongoing torment of the Bowden family, effectively turning the legal system against the very person who once defended him in court."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: I love this hairdryer Product review: This is a great dryer.

It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it.    In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \\" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\\"    When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating  the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw.    So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October.

Process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again.  Question: suppose the heat source is less efficient happens, how will it affect LESS igneous rock forming.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"B: Less A less efficient heat source will have a significant impact on the formation of igneous rocks. To understand why, let's delve deeper into the different stages of the rock cycle and the role that heat plays in these processes. First, it's essential to know that the rock cycle is a series of processes by which rocks are formed, broken down, and transformed into other types of rocks. The three main types of rocks are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock material) cools and solidifies. This cooling may occur either beneath the Earth's surface, forming intrusive igneous rocks, or on the surface due to volcanic eruptions, forming extrusive igneous rocks. Now, let's consider the scenario where the heat source is less efficient. This means that there is not enough heat to properly melt the rocks or maintain a high enough temperature for the magma to remain in a molten state. The following consequences may arise: 1. Reduced volcanic activity: With less heat, fewer volcanic eruptions may occur, meaning there will be fewer opportunities for the formation of extrusive igneous rocks. If the molten material does not reach the surface, it may not solidify as igneous rock. 2. Slower cooling process: If the heat source is less efficient, the magma may cool more slowly. This can result in a different texture of the resulting igneous rocks, with larger mineral crystals forming due to the prolonged cooling time. However, this could also mean that the formation of new igneous rocks takes longer overall. 3. Lower chance of intrusive igneous rock formation: With insufficient heat, the rock material won't be as molten and pliable, reducing the likelihood of forming intrusive igneous rock structures like plutons or batholiths. 4. Increased sedimentation: As less igneous rock is formed, there may be an increase in sedimentary rock formation. This is because the broken-down particles from preexisting rocks, which would typically be recycled into new igneous rocks, may accumulate as sediments and eventually transform into sedimentary rocks. To sum up, a less efficient heat source will likely lead to less igneous rock formation due to reduced volcanic activity, slower cooling processes, and a lower chance of both intrusive and extrusive igneous rock formation. Consequently, there may be an increase in the formation of sedimentary rocks as the particles from weathered rocks accumulate as sediments. Therefore, the correct answer to your question is option B: less igneous rock formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.  Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class.

Process:  - A tree produces seeds - The seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, etc - The seeds reach the ground - Grow into new trees - These new trees produce seeds - The process repeats itself over and over -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose no trees are cut down happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If no trees are cut down, it is presumed that the natural process of forest formation will continue undisturbed. This perturbation hypothesis will have several direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation, potentially leading to an increased rate of forest growth, resulting in more forests being formed over time. Here are some of the key effects: 1. Increased seed production and dispersion: When trees are allowed to grow and mature fully, they can produce more seeds. This increase in seed production will, in turn, result in a greater number of seeds being dispersed by wind, animals, and water over a larger area. As a consequence, there will be a greater chance for new trees to establish themselves and grow into mature trees, expanding the forested area. 2. Enhanced habitat and biodiversity: Allowing trees to mature and develop naturally will support a diverse ecosystem of plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. This increased biodiversity can contribute to healthy soil development, nutrient cycling, and natural pest control, all of which are essential for a thriving forest ecosystem. Over time, this will create a more resilient and self-sustaining forest, facilitating the formation of more forests in the long run. 3. Improved carbon sequestration: Mature trees are more effective at storing carbon in their trunks, branches, and roots than younger trees. By not cutting down trees, forests will be allowed to sequester more carbon from the atmosphere and help mitigate climate change. This can lead to a more stable climate, which is beneficial for the growth and development of forests. 4. Enhanced soil conditions: Mature trees contribute to better soil formation and stability through their extensive root systems, leaf litter, and the decay of dead wood. These factors allow for better soil retention, structure, and nutrient cycling, which provide suitable conditions for seed germination and seedling establishment. Therefore, by not cutting down trees, the soil conditions for new forest formation will be better maintained. 5. Natural disturbances: As part of the natural forest dynamics, disturbances such as fire, storms, or pest outbreaks will still occur, even if trees are not cut down by humans. These disturbances can create gaps in the forest canopy, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor and providing space for new trees to grow. Hence, even without human intervention, forests will still experience some level of disturbance that promotes forest growth and expansion. In summary, if no trees are cut down, the natural process of forest formation and expansion is expected to increase, providing more chances for seed production, dispersion, and establishment. This would likely lead to an indirect increase in forest formation over time. Additionally, better habitat, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and soil conditions will be maintained, further supporting the growing forests and mitigating the impacts of climate change."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q:Given the following context:  At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person who wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre?

By this stage, Allmusic observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, \\"inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses\\". Because of this, Okie Dokie was considerably more focused and less \\"goofy\\" than Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles. Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him the centre of Okie Dokie production and, according to Pitchfork Media, made it \\"difficult to say where [Paterson] is in the picture\\". The Orb's releases with Kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with the press and showed that they could \\"age gracefully\\".In August 2006, the founders of the Orb - Paterson and Cauty - released Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God, their debut album as the Transit Kings with Guy Pratt and Pratt's associate, Dom Beken. The album featured appearances from Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr and comedian Simon Day. Beken described Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God as \\"self-consciously musically written and less sample-based\\" compared to the members' previous work. Living had been in production since 2001, but due to members' other obligations, it was delayed for several years. The album received mixed critical reactions, with reviewers such as The Sun comparing the album favourably to the music of DJ Shadow and Röyksopp while other publications, such as The Times, called it \\"Orb-lite\\" and proclaimed it to be \\"Deep Forest-style sludge\\". Soon after the album's release, Cauty left the Transit Kings on \\"extended leave\\", leaving the project in indefinite limbo.

The note on the counter said \\"please be seated\\" so OK. I sat at the communal table in the middle of the room and waited...and waited...and waited. Ten minutes by my watch. Nobody behind the counter or taking food out looked at me, or acknowledged me. So, I decided I must be doing it wrong. I walked up to the counter to order and was told by the man behind the counter that \\"no, we wait on you\\" but he nicely took my order (sandwich and coke), and let me pay (BTW, I included a 20% tip up front, when I paid with my card, so I was trying to be proactive about getting good service...lesson learned) and said they would bring things out. I waited...and I waited...and I waited, while several people came in, seated themselves, were brought place mats, utensils, ice water, and their orders taken and their drink orders brought out.  I finally walked back up to the counter and asked to at least get my drink order...profuse apology from the man behind the counter, gave me a bottle of coke which turned out to be frozen solid. Another trip to the counter.  By this time you can only smile at the comedy of errors. They finally brought me a place mat and the rest (no, ice water never showed up), and then finally the sandwich. I suppose the sandwich, which was good, on good bread, well made and tasty, is the reason to give Scratch the benefit of the doubt and give them 2 stars (the service was below 1 star). The little salad they serve with the sandwich was fresh and the vinaigrette was tasty, so that was nice as well. Was it 11.00 + tip for a small sandwich good? Well, that is my quandary. I think at that kind of price point, the sandwich needs to be terrific, not just good. And, the service should at least be adequate, and it was nowhere near adequate. So, 2 stars for now, and maybe I will go back and try it again in a few months.

The service they received was described as below 1-star.  However, they did find the sandwich to be good, well-made, and tasty, and the small salad served with the sandwich to be fresh and enjoyable. This positive aspect of the food quality led them to rate Scratch with 2 stars. The reviewer expresses doubt over the price point for the quality of the sandwich and service received, contributing to their negative sentiment.

In Tanzania, it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist. While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.[citation needed] If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where can safari hunters go which are uninviting to the less hardcore ecotourist?","output":"Safari hunters can visit various destinations that may be uninviting or less appealing to the less hardcore ecotourist. These locations usually involve challenging terrains, extreme weather conditions, and limited amenities or infrastructure. Here are a few examples of such places: 1. Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania: Selous Game Reserve is one of Africa's largest protected wildlife areas and offers the opportunity for adventurous hunters to experience the thrill of hunting big game. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including elephants, lions, buffalo, and leopards. The terrain is rugged, and accommodations are more basic compared to luxury lodges or hotels. 2. Niassa Reserve, Mozambique: Niassa Reserve, located in northern Mozambique, is a relatively remote and lesser-known destination for safari hunting. It is rich in wildlife, including sable antelope, elephant, lion, and buffalo. Its remoteness and lack of infrastructure make it unattractive for the average ecotourist. 3. Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic: This national park offers a remote, wild environment for safari hunters to explore. It is home to elephants, bongos, forest buffalos, and primates, all thriving in dense, tropical forests. Due to its challenging accessibility and distance from main tourist hubs, it is not a popular destination for the casual ecotourist. 4. Kalahari Desert, Botswana and South Africa: The vast, arid landscapes of the Kalahari Desert present a challenging environment for safari hunting. The harsh climate and limited water sources make it a less popular destination for more mainstream ecotourists. However, the desert is home to unique species like the gemsbok, springbok, and the elusive black-maned Kalahari lion, making it an intriguing destination for more hardcore safari hunters. 5. Omo Valley, Ethiopia: Another remote safari hunting destination, the Omo Valley is an ethnically and ecologically diverse region of Ethiopia. It hosts a variety of wildlife species, some of which are endemic to the area. Its extreme remoteness and limited amenities make it less appealing to casual ecotourists, but it offers memorable hunting experiences to those who venture there. These locations are just a few examples of where safari hunters can go to enjoy a more challenging and remote experience, away from the more popular ecotourism destinations. However, it is important to remember that hunting regulations and conservation practices must be strictly followed in these areas to ensure sustainable wildlife management and protect the local ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Where did the  coat of arms proper and a lozenge granted to women not develoupe?  A: Usually men inherited the coat of arms from their fathers.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"To provide a proper answer to the question, let me first clarify the topic and then present an appropriate response step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking about the circumstances or location where a coat of arms with a lozenge was not granted to women. Step 2: Provide historical context The coat of arms is a tradition that dates back to medieval Europe, where they were used to distinguish different families, clans, and individuals on the battlefield. These symbols were usually passed down from father to son and could be modified slightly to represent individual members of the family. Step 3: Explain the role of women in inheritance of coat of arms In general, women were not granted a coat of arms of their own. However, they could inherit their father's coat of arms if they had no brothers, or they could use their husband's coat of arms after marriage. In such cases, the coat of arms would be displayed on a lozenge-shaped shield, rather than the traditional male shield shape. Step 4: Identify locations or circumstances where this did not develop It is challenging to pinpoint an exact location or circumstances where the tradition of a coat arms with a lozenge for women did not develop. The reason for this is that the granting and inheritance of coats of arms varied significantly among families, regions, and time periods. However, regions where heraldry was less common or not practiced at all, such as certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, would typically lack the tradition of granting coat of arms with a lozenge to women. Answer: The tradition of granting a coat of arms with a lozenge to women did not develop in regions where heraldry was less common or not practiced, such as some parts of Eastern Europe and Asia. Keep in mind that this varied significantly among families, regions, and time periods."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Erotes are a collective of winged gods associated with love and sex in Greek mythology. They are part of Aphrodite's retinue. \\"Erotes\\" (Greek ) is the plural of \\"Eros\\" (\\"Love, Desire\\"), who as a singular deity has a more complex mythology.  - Psychoanalytic theory is the theory of personality organization and the dynamics of personality development that guides psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology. First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939, and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected. Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the mind and the related psychological attributes making up the mind, and on treatment using free association and the phenomena of transference. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics. Starting with his publication of \\"The Interpretation of Dreams\\" in 1899, his theories began to gain prominence.  - Psychopathology is the scientific study of mental disorders, including efforts to understand their genetic, biological, psychological, and social causes; effective classification schemes (nosology); course across all stages of development; manifestations; and treatment. The term may also refer to the manifestation of behaviors that indicate the presence of a mental disorder.  - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856  23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.  - Aphrodite (; Greek: (\\"Afrodíti\\")) is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. She is identified with the planet Venus, and her Roman equivalent is the goddess .  - In classical mythology, Cupid (Latin Cupido, meaning \\"desire\\") is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars, and is known in Latin also as \\"Amor\\" (\\"Love\\"). His Greek counterpart is Eros.  - Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being, and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss.  - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.  - The University of Vienna is a public university located in Vienna, Austria. It was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world. With its long and rich history, the University of Vienna has developed into one of the biggest universities in Europe, and also one of the most renowned, especially in the Humanities. It is associated with 15 Nobel prize winners and has been the academic home of a large number of figures both of historical and academic importance.  - Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind, which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders. The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others.  - In Greek mythology, Thanatos ([] \\"Death\\", from  \\"thnsk\\" \\"to die, be dying\\") was the personification of death. He was a minor figure in Greek mythology, often referred to, but rarely appearing in person.  - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  - Beyond the Pleasure Principle ( German : Jenseits des Lustprinzips ) is a 1920 essay by Sigmund Freud that marks a major turning point in his theoretical approach . Previously , Freud attributed most human behavior to the sexual instinct ( Eros or libido ) . With this essay , Freud went \`\` beyond '' the simple pleasure principle , developing his theory of drives with the addition of the death drive ( s ) ( Todestrieb ( e ) ) ( often referred to as \`\` Thanatos '' ) .  - Hypersexuality is a clinical diagnosis used by mental healthcare researchers and providers to describe extremely frequent or suddenly increased sexual urges or sexual activity. The terms nymphomania and satyriasis were once used to describe the condition, in women and men respectively, but are no longer in general medical use, although the former is still used colloquially.  - Moravia  is a historical country in the Czech Republic (forming its eastern part) and one of the historical Czech lands, together with Bohemia and Czech Silesia. The medieval and early modern Margraviate of Moravia was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (from 1348 to 1918), an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire (1004 to 1806), later a crown land of the Austrian Empire (1804 to 1867) and briefly also one of 17 former crown lands of the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867 to 1918. During the early 20th century, Moravia was one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1928; it was then merged with Czech Silesia, and eventually dissolved by abolition of the land system in 1949.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - In Greek mythology, Eros (or ,  \\"Desire\\") was the Greek god of love. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (\\"desire\\"). Some myths make him a primordial god, while in other myths, he is the son of Aphrodite. He was one of the winged love gods, Erotes.  - Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.  - In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive is the drive towards death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\\" (\\"\\"Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens\\"\\") which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\\" This concept has been translated as, \\"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\\". In \\"Pleasure Principle\\", Freud used the plural \\"death drives\\" (\\"Todestriebe\\") much more frequently than in the singular.  - Neuropathology is the study of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either small surgical biopsies or whole-body autopsies. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. It should not be confused with neuropathy, which refers to disorders of the nerves themselves (usually in the peripheral nervous system).  - Libido, colloquially known as sex drive, is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone and dopamine, respectively) regulate libido in humans. Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, like personality and stress, can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g., puberty). A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, while the opposite condition is hyposexuality.  - Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behavior. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus.

Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.  Question: \\"What are the highest and lowest points of a wave?\\" Answer: \\"Lowest is Crest and Highest is Trough\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Available options: + no + yes","output":"no The correct answer should be: \\"Highest is Crest and Lowest is Trough.\\" The original answer provided is incorrect because it reverses the positions of the crest and the trough. According to the given information, the highest point of a wave is the crest, while the lowest point is the trough."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read this: When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing. The ZIF insertion used by Nintendo was set to emulate what device? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The ZIF insertion used by Nintendo was set to emulate a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the time he finished school as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized within the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820 he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Lyudmila, amidst much controversy about its subject and style. Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. This angered the government, and led to his transfer from the capital (1820). He went to the Caucasus and to the Crimea, then to Kamenka and Chisinau, where he became a Freemason.  Question: \\"What were main events in Pushkin's early years of writing poetry?

This shocking event sends shockwaves through the entertainment industry and triggers an in-depth investigation, led by detective Martin Espinoza, to uncover the mystery behind her shooting. In her quest for fame, Kiri had made a web of complex friendships, rivalries, and alliances. Through Martin's interactions with Kiri's closest associates, it is revealed that Kiri had harbored dark secrets, ones that made her a target for several people. One key character throughout the story is Allegra, Kiri's childhood friend and fellow actress who entered the world of Hollywood together with her. At first glance, Allegra appears to be a supportive and trusting friend, but as the investigation unfolds, her true nature is slowly revealed, showing jealousy and resentment for Kiri's blossoming career. As the plot thickens, we learn about more potential suspects, including Kiri's ex-boyfriend turned stalker, her envious co-star, and a ruthless studio executive blackmailing her. We also glimpse into Kiri's own dark side as Detective Martin discovers that Kiri was involved in multiple shady deals to secure her rise to fame. In the climax of the story, detective Martin follows a lead that points to the relevance between Kiri's shooting and a conspiracy revealing a major scandal that could take down multiple powerful figures in the entertainment industry. Kiri, it turns out, had discovered the scandal and was on the verge of making it public before being shot. As the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the truth comes to light - it was Allegra who shot Kiri after discovering her involvement in the scandal, fearing it would not only put an end to Kiri's career but also bring down her own. Hurt by Kiri's betrayal and driven by her hunger for fame, Allegra took matters into her own hands in a desperate attempt to protect her career and remain in the limelight. In the final confrontation between Allegra and detective Martin, Allegra reveals the extent of her jealousy and her willingness to do whatever it takes to maintain her success. The movie ends with Allegra in police custody, and Kiri's secrets now public, leaving the future of Hollywood uncertain. This thrilling and dark exploration into the price of fame and the dark secrets lurking behind the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry will keep audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

One of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters swiftly reacted and strafed the machine gun position until the firing ceased. After this incident, the soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. However, as they moved forward, an explosion occurred—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—resulting in injuries to seven men. These casualties included the company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller relayed a casualty report, which led to one of the Chinooks assisting the Royal Irish extraction from Gberi Bana to land and pick up the wounded. The helicopter then retrieved the Royal Irish and transported both groups to RFA Sir Percivale, where the 13 men were assessed by medics. The operation proceeded under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who took command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded. Each platoon proceeded to assault different clusters of buildings that had been assigned to them during their training prior to the mission."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on developments in Congress (all times local):      1:20 p.m.      A Senate panel has voted favorably for the nomination of former wrestling entertainment executive Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration.      The 18-1 vote from the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee moves McMahon's nomination to the full Senate for consideration. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has cast the lone \\"no\\" vote.      McMahon is the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment. She ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut but has remained active in politics as a donor to Republican candidates and causes.      The Small Business Administration helps people get training and financing to start or expand their company. McMahon says she'll make it a priority to review the agency's disaster assistance programs.      McMahon has emphasized her business roots helping to getting the wrestling business up and running and eventually employing more than 800 people.      __      1:15 p.m.      The Senate has confirmed Elaine Chao to serve as Transportation secretary in the Trump administration.      The vote was 93-6 on Tuesday.      Chao is an experienced Washington hand. She was labor secretary under President George W. Bush, and is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.      McConnell voted present.      Chao would be a lead actor in pursuing Trump's promise to invest 1 trillion to improve highways, rail service and other infrastructure projects.      __      12:05 p.m.      A Senate committee has approved Republican donor and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos for education secretary, even as two GOP senators expressed some reservations.      After a heated debate Tuesday morning, senators on the Health, Education, Pensions and Labor Committee have voted 12-11 along partisan lines to support DeVos' nomination, sending it to the full Senate for action.      But two prominent Republicans on the committee, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, are expressing their skepticism over DeVos. They say they are not yet sure whether they will vote for her on the Senate floor.      Murkowski says DeVos has yet to prove that she deeply cares about America's struggling schools and its children. Murkowski says the nominee has not yet earned her full support.      ___      11:20 a.m.      The AFL-CIO is urging the Senate to reject President Trump's pick for to lead the Labor Department.      Federation President Richard L. Trumka said in a letter to senators Tuesday that Andrew Puzder's nomination \\"betrays the promise (Trump) made to put working people first.\\"      He added that Puzder's record as CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc., could risk government protections on overtime and worker safety. He noted that Puzder is opposed to a big hike in the minimum wage and could \\"torpedo\\" pay rules on certain federal contracts.      Puzder has said that \\"the right government policies can\\" produce more jobs and better wages. His confirmation hearing is expected Feb. 7.      Democrats have widely panned Puzder's nomination in similar terms. But Republicans control the Senate and there's no sign Puzder's confirmation is imperiled.      ___      11:10 a.m.      Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state says she is disturbed that President Donald Trump has removed the energy secretary from a permanent positon on the National Security Council. Trump removed the energy chief as part of a shake-up that also ousted the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence.      Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate energy panel, said the energy secretary has a key role in safeguarding the nation's nuclear stockpile. Former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist, played a crucial role in developing the 2015 agreement aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.      Cantwell said \\"now is not the time to remove the energy secretary\\" from the national security post, noting that the Iran deal is \\"based so much on science.\\"      __      11 a.m.      Republican and Democratic senators are clashing over the nomination of charter school activist and wealthy Republican donor Betsy DeVos as education secretary.      As the Senate Health, Education, Pensions and Labor Committee prepares to vote Tuesday on DeVos' nomination, Chairman Lamar Alexander is lamenting Democrats' fierce opposition to President Donald Trump's pick.      He says he respects his colleagues and doesn't question their motives or votes but thinks \\"their concerns are misplaced.\\"      Sen. Patty Murray of Washington State, the top Democrat on the committee said it was clear that DeVos is \\"the wrong choice.\\"      Murray charged that DeVos has spent her family's wealth to push \\"extreme anti-student ideology\\" siphoning money away from public schools \\"toward taxpayer funded private school vouchers, with little accountability, for just a few.\\"      __      10:44 a.m.      Senate Finance Committee votes to confirm President Donald Trump's picks for health and Treasury secretary are being indefinitely postponed after Democrats boycotted the meeting.      Democratic senators held an abruptly called briefing for reporters outside the hearing room. They said they were demanding more information about the two nominees, GOP Georgia Rep. Tom Price to be Health secretary and financier Steve Mnuchin to head the Treasury Department.      The Democrats cited separate newspaper reports about Price's trading in a health company stock and Mnuchin's behavior involving foreclosures when he was a banker.      Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said he planned to reschedule the votes but did not say when. He said Democrats \\"ought to stop posturing and acting like idiots.\\"      __      10:35 a.m.      The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee says she'll vote against President Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, Sen.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is meeting Tuesday to vote on the nomination.      Feinstein also praised Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by Trump Monday after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban.      \\"That statement took a steel spine to stand up and say no,\\" Feinstein said. \\"That is what an attorney general must be willing and able to do.\\"      Feinstein said she has \\"no confidence\\" Sessions would do that.      __      10:20 a.m.      Attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions says he had no role in helping the White House draft an executive order on refugees and immigration.      In responses to Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy about his involvement in writing executive orders, Sessions wrote: \\"None. Neither I, nor any of my current staff, had such a role.\\"      Leahy asked the question Jan. 25 in reference to orders involving immigration. Sessions returned the written answers Monday.      The Judiciary panel is meeting to vote on Sessions' nomination. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley defended the Alabama senator, who has been one of President Donald Trump's strongest supporters.      \\"It's not clear to me why it would be a problem even if he had been involved,\\" Grassley said.      __      10 a.m.      The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has backed Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke for Interior secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry for Energy secretary.      President Donald Trump's nominees met little resistance in the panel Tuesday morning. The committee voted 16-6 for Zinke and 16-7 for Perry.      The nominations now go to the full Senate. ||||| Elaine Chao moves forward despite a brief round of uncertainty about whether she would get caught up in Democrats' protest of Trump's executive orders. | AP Photo Senate endorses Elaine Chao for Transportation Department      The Senate Tuesday handily approved Elaine Chao to be the next secretary of Transportation, despite a handful of Democratic no votes amid unrest about President Donald Trump’s executive orders.      What would likely have been a unanimous vote in her favor before President Trump’s controversial travel ban ended up with six Democrats voting against her: Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Cory Booker (N.J.) — and, most notably, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.). Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — Chao’s spouse — voted “present.”      Story Continued Below      On Monday, Schumer had tweeted that he would vote no on “everybody” — “DeVos - No Tillerson - No Sessions - No Mulvaney - No Price - No Mnuchin - No Pruitt - No Puzder – No.” Chao wasn’t named specifically. He also tweeted that day, “I'll vote NO on noms who'll be the very worst of the anti-immigrant, anti-middle class, billionaires’ club cabinet.” He hadn’t indicated that Chao was among those.      None of the senators’ offices immediately responded to requests for comment on their no vote, but they are likely protest votes about things other than Chao or her qualifications.      Other Democrats gave her a full-throated endorsement.      Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he’s “pleased that, unlike many of the individuals that President Trump has nominated to the highest posts in government, Secretary Chao takes this position with a background in transportation issues and previous experience running a federal agency.” He noted his hope that Chao would be able to get bipartisan consensus in Congress to “develop a responsible infrastructure bill” that provides “real funding” to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure.      Indeed, Chao now inherits the responsibility of putting meat on the bones of Trump’s infrastructure plan, sold during his campaign as a trillion-dollar investment in the nation’s roads, bridges, airports, electric grid, schools and broadband. But GOP leaders in Congress have appeared less eager to endorse a big-spending infrastructure proposal, and have not prioritized Trump’s vision amid a host of other items such as health care.      There are also questions about just how much direct federal spending may be included in Trump’s infrastructure plan, which would be key to attracting Democrats. What few details the administration has provided so far appear to describe a plan relying mostly on tax incentives and private-sector capital. Chao said at her confirmation hearing that the infrastructure plan would likely include some direct spending, but the amount will be a subject of much debate.      Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, noted Tuesday that Trump hadn’t consulted with Chao before implementing his travel ban, which caused chaos at airports around the world. Regardless, he voted in favor of her nomination.      “We need Secretary Chao as someone who has the experience and has common sense and would be in the position to offer level-headed, good experience-based advice to the government going forward,” Nelson said on the Senate floor.      Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said before the vote that “it would be hard to come up with a more qualified nominee” for the position at the helm of DOT than Chao, who has already served as the department’s deputy secretary, as well as secretary of Labor. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In recent developments in the US Congress, a Senate panel voted 18-1 favorably for the nomination of former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as head of the Small Business Administration.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus?  The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial.

SANTA FE, New Mexico |      SANTA FE, New Mexico (Reuters) - Billy the Kid, the Wild West outlaw who is reputed to have killed 21 men and whose exploits have been widely chronicled in U.S. popular culture, is under consideration for a pardon.      New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said on Thursday he was reviewing a pardon petition based on the widespread belief that New Mexico territorial Governor Lew Wallace promised the 19th century gunman a pardon in exchange for his testimony in a murder trial.      \\"As someone who is fascinated with New Mexico's rich history, I've always been intrigued by the story of Billy the Kid and, in particular, the alleged promise of a pardon he was given,\\" Richardson said in a statement.      \\"I will diligently review this new petition and all the facts available regarding an agreement between Billy the Kid and Governor Wallace before rendering any decision,\\" Richardson said, adding he would decide by the end of the year.      The two-term Democratic governor, who leaves office at the end of the month, asked historians and others to weigh in with their opinions on a website dedicated to the issue, here      Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett shot Billy the Kid to death at point-blank range in 1881. Newspapers had already turned the young outlaw, whose real name was Henry McCarty, into a larger-than-life figure by the time of his death in his early 20s. A book by Garrett transformed McCarty into a legendary figure of America's western frontier. He has since become the subject of many songs, films and books.      Richardson received various pardon requests over the years from McCarty's descendants, but this was the first formal petition he received in the matter.      It was presented by trial attorney and western history buff Randi McGinn, who was designated to study the documents of that era to determine whether there was sufficient basis for a pardon to be seriously considered.      The petition she submitted on Tuesday \\"is narrow in scope and does not argue for a blanket pardon of all of Billy the Kid's activities,\\" a statement from Richardson's office said.

Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The first restriction of antibiotics was for controlling the emergence of antibiotic resistance by limiting their use, as introduced in the UK in 1970 following the Swann report of 1969."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: We Chat, the Chinese social media smartphone app, saw an increase in user numbers of 41 per cent year on year to 500m at the end of 2014, in a sign that parent company Tencent is extending  its reach for the mobile internet. Revenue grew 24 per cent to Rmb20.98billion, slightly higher than forecasts, driven mainly by online gaming revenues. It is unclear how much WeChat contributed to Tencent's revenues but the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it tries to adjust its business to be more suitable for mobile devices. \\"We extended our leadership in games and online media, and made breakthroughs in emerging platforms such as online security . . . and mobile payments,\\" Ma Huateng, Tencent chairman, said in a statement. WeChat is the second highest ranked app in China, behind QQ, Tencent's other chatting app, which claimed to have 815m registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, that figure is more than the total number of internet users in China, which the government puts at 640million. Tencent has been unwilling to earn money through WeChat by flooding it with advertising, which could reduce efforts to increase the user base. But this is expected to change. Some analysts predicted that advertising would be introduced on later this year. Early attempts to test ads on the service have not always gone smoothly. After a BMW ad was introduced on some users' feeds in January, many users complained of \\"discrimination\\" by Tencent's data mining algorithm. They said it unfairly considered them as not wealthy or successful enough to view the sought-after BMW ad. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: Answer:","output":"From the passage, we can learn that WeChat, a Chinese social media smartphone app, experienced a significant increase in user numbers (41% year on year) to reach 500 million by the end of 2014. This growth indicates that its parent company, Tencent, is successfully extending its reach in the mobile internet market. The company's revenue grew by 24% to ¥20.98 billion, mainly driven by online gaming revenues. Although the specific contribution of WeChat to Tencent's revenues is not clear, the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it adapts its business to be more mobile-centric. Tencent Chairman Ma Huateng mentioned that they have extended their leadership in games and online media while making breakthroughs in emerging platforms like online security and mobile payments.  Additionally, Tencent has two top-ranked apps in China, with WeChat being second to QQ, another Tencent-owned chatting app that claimed to have 815 million registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, the passage notes that this number is higher than the total number of internet users in China (640 million), according to government data. Tencent has been cautious about monetizing WeChat through advertising to avoid hindering user base growth, but analysts predict that it will eventually introduce ads. Early trials of ads on the app, such as a BMW ad, led to user complaints regarding data mining and discrimination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

Federico Fellini, Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI (Italian: [fede'ri:ko fel'li:ni]; 20 January 1920 - 31 October 1993) was an Italian film director and screenwriter. Known for his distinct style that blends fantasy and baroque images with earthiness, he is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. His films have ranked, in polls such as Cahiers du cinema and Sight & Sound, as some of the greatest films of all time. Sight & Sound lists his 1963 film 8 1/2  as the 10th-greatest film of all time. Retained on business in Rimini, Urbano sent wife and family to Rome in 1940 to share an apartment with his son. Fellini and Ruggero Maccari, also on the staff of Marc'Aurelio, began writing radio sketches and gags for films.  Not yet twenty and with Fabrizi's help, Fellini obtained his first screen credit as a comedy writer on Mario Mattoli's Il pirata sono io (The Pirate's Dream). Progressing rapidly to numerous collaborations on films at Cinecitta, his circle of professional acquaintances widened to include novelist Vitaliano Brancati and scriptwriter Piero Tellini. In the wake of Mussolini's declaration of war against France and England on 10 June 1940, Fellini discovered Kafka's The Metamorphosis, Gogol, John Steinbeck and William Faulkner along with French films by Marcel Carne, Rene Clair, and Julien Duvivier. In 1941 he published Il mio amico Pasqualino, a 74-page booklet in ten chapters describing the absurd adventures of Pasqualino, an alter ego.  Writing for radio while attempting to avoid the draft, Fellini met his future wife Giulietta Masina in a studio office at the Italian public radio broadcaster EIAR in the autumn of 1942. Well-paid as the voice of Pallina in Fellini's radio serial, Cico and Pallina, Masina was also well known for her musical-comedy broadcasts which cheered an audience depressed by the war. In November 1942, Fellini was sent to Libya, occupied by Fascist Italy, to work on the screenplay of I cavalieri del deserto (Knights of the Desert, 1942), directed by Osvaldo Valenti and Gino Talamo. Fellini welcomed the assignment as it allowed him \\"to secure another extension on his draft order\\". Responsible for emergency re-writing, he also directed the film's first scenes. When Tripoli fell under siege by British forces, he and his colleagues made a narrow escape by boarding a German military plane flying to Sicily. His African adventure, later published in Marc'Aurelio as \\"The First Flight\\", marked \\"the emergence of a new Fellini, no longer just a screenwriter, working and sketching at his desk, but a filmmaker out in the field\\".  The apolitical Fellini was finally freed of the draft when an Allied air raid over Bologna destroyed his medical records. Fellini and Giulietta hid in her aunt's apartment until Mussolini's fall on 25 July 1943. After dating for nine months, the couple were married on 30 October 1943. Several months later, Masina fell down the stairs and suffered a miscarriage. She gave birth to a son, Pierfederico, on 22 March 1945, but the child died of encephalitis a month later on 24 April 1945. The tragedy had enduring emotional and artistic repercussions.

Article: Elizabeth Freeman was born about 1742 to African American parents who were slaves. At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued  for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founder of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights. Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: \\"She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  What is an answer for this question: Which city experienced more convection within the Earth causing the plates to move? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, we know that convection within the Earth causes the plates to move, leading to earthquakes.

The Pennsylvania State Capitol houses the chambers for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement.  The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center.

The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2) of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\".

It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas.

John McCain (R-Arizona) said yesterday that he will introduce legislation for mandatory drug testing of athletes if major league baseball players and owners do","output":"not agree on a plan to eliminate steroid use in their sport. The announcement comes in the wake of an ongoing investigation and several high-profile doping scandals involving prominent athletes. This situation has raised concerns about the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in sports and has led to policymakers and sports officials calling for stricter regulations on drugs in sports. The use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports has a long and complex history. While there is evidence that stimulants and other substances have been used by athletes since ancient times, the modern era of doping began in the early 20th century, when anabolic steroids were first developed. As these and other substances became more readily available and their effects on athletic performance became more widely recognized, their use became more prevalent, often leading to a competitive arms race between those who sought to use PEDs and those who sought to detect and penalize their use. This history of doping in sports has led to considerable controversy. On one hand, some argue that the use of PEDs is a legitimate and predictable response to the intense pressures and expectations faced by professional athletes, and that seeking an advantage through any means necessary is simply part of the competitive process. Others counter that the use of PEDs undermines the fundamental values of sportsmanship, fair competition, and the pursuit of excellence through hard work and dedication. Additionally, there are concerns about the health risks associated with the use of PEDs, which can include heart problems, liver damage, and increased risk of strokes, among other issues. The proposal by Sen. John McCain to introduce legislation for mandatory drug testing of athletes is an attempt to address these concerns and combat the use of PEDs in sports. This approach has several potential benefits. First, mandatory testing would level the playing field by identifying and removing athletes who are using PEDs, thereby increasing the likelihood that the outcome of competitions would be determined by talent and hard work rather than by who has access to the best doping agents. Second, mandatory testing could serve as a deterrent to athletes who may be tempted to use PEDs, as they would face the consequence of being caught and facing significant penalties, including the loss of endorsements, suspensions, and damage to their reputations. Third, widespread drug testing could raise public awareness of the issue of doping in sports, leading to greater scrutiny of the issue and more pressure on athletes and sports organizations to promote clean competition. However, mandatory drug testing for athletes also faces several challenges. First, the issue of privacy and the scope of drug testing could pose legal challenges, as athletes and player associations may argue that mandatory drug testing constitutes an invasion of their privacy rights. Moreover, there are concerns about the potential for false-positive test results, which could unfairly jeopardize the careers of innocent athletes. Second, the development and implementation of a comprehensive drug testing program can be costly, as it requires specialized labs, equipment, and personnel to carry out the tests and analyze the results. Critics argue that these resources could be better spent on other initiatives aimed at promoting clean sports, such as education, training, and support for athletes. In addition, the effectiveness of mandatory drug testing as a deterrent to doping is debated. Some critics argue that determined dopers will simply find new ways to avoid detection, and that these efforts may ultimately result in a more sophisticated and dangerous doping landscape. As a result, these critics question whether mandatory testing actually creates a level playing field or simply encourages the development of new, more advanced doping agents and methods to avoid detection. In conclusion, the proposal by Sen. John McCain to introduce legislation for mandatory drug testing of athletes is an important step in the ongoing debate over the role of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. While the benefits of mandatory testing, such as leveling the playing field and acting as a deterrent to doping, are significant, there are also considerable challenges that need to be addressed, including the cost of implementing such tests and concerns about privacy and the potential for false-positive results. Ultimately, the effectiveness of any anti-doping measure will depend on the dedication and commitment of athletes, sports organizations, policymakers, and the public to the principle of clean and fair competition in sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During this process, glucose molecules are combined with oxygen, which eventually leads to the creation of water, ATP, and carbon dioxide.

Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing  powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially   produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red   and ultra-violet   rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

The answer is:","output":"This information is about Donald Dinnie, a Scottish Highland Games strongman who was born in 1837 in Birse, Scotland. Donald Dinnie was one of the most renowned strongmen and athletes of the 19th century, and his accomplishments were widely recognized within the world of Highland Games and beyond. Dinnie's weight of 210 lbs (95 kg) and height of 6'1\\" (185 cm) were well-suited for the physically demanding activities associated with the Highland Games, which typically included events such as the hammer throw, caber toss, and the stone put. In his career, Donald Dinnie participated in more than 11,000 competitions, winning over 10,000 of these. His exceptional skill and prowess across a range of events earned him a revered status among contemporaries and later generations. Born as Donald Dinnie in 1837 in a small rural parish in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, he grew up in a family with strong connections to the traditional Highland Games. His father, David Dinnie, was a well-known competitor, and his brother, Robert, also participated in Highland Games competitions throughout Scotland. As a result, it was natural for Donald to develop a profound interest and talent in these sports from an early age. Throughout his career, Dinnie traveled extensively to compete in various events, both in the UK and abroad, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. His success led to numerous invitations to perform as a professional athlete, and he represented Scotland in international competitions. One of the most famous challenges associated with Donald Dinnie is the \\"Dinnie Stones,\\" which are two massive stones with a combined weight of over 730 lbs (330 kg) that he reportedly carried across the Potarch Bridge in Aberdeenshire in 1860. In addition to his achievements as a strongman, Dinnie was also an accomplished businessman, running a successful gymnasium and providing training and coaching services to fellow athletes. However, his name will forever be synonymous with the Highland Games, where he left a lasting legacy. Sadly, Donald Dinnie passed away in 1916 at the age of 79. However, his impact on the Highland Games and Scottish sports, in general, remains to this day. Throughout his remarkable career, achievements, and enduring legacy, Donald Dinnie remains a symbol of strength and fortitude for generations of athletes inspired by his example."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS Copperfin, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs San Francisco on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death.

When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain.  Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction.

OPTIONS: 1). World; 2). Sports; 3). Business; 4). Science/Tech;","output":"This text falls under the category of \\"Business.\\" In this passage, the focus is on how game publishers and hardware makers are competing to capture the attention and spending of consumers during the holiday season by releasing a variety of high-profile products. This is a common business strategy, especially in the gaming industry, where companies try to capitalize on the increased spending during the holidays to boost their sales and revenue. The text does not involve aspects related to world events, sports, or scientific and technological advancements, which eliminates the other options. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 3, \\"Business.\\" The success of game publishers and hardware makers during the holiday season depends on various factors, such as the appeal of their products, marketing efforts, consumer preferences, and competition within the industry. This time of the year is particularly crucial for gaming companies because the holiday season is when customers are more likely to spend on products such as games and gaming consoles as gifts or as a form of entertainment during their time off. Companies fiercely compete to release their most attractive products during this period, seeking to maximize their market share and secure high sales figures. To achieve these goals, gaming companies invest heavily in marketing and development. It is essential to build awareness and generate buzz around their products, which can lead to increased sales and long-term success. For example, they may use social media platforms, trade shows, and endorsements from popular video game influencers to reach out to their target audience. Marketing campaigns for these high-profile releases often include game trailers, previews, and promotions targeting a global audience. Additionally, hardware makers usually invest in research and development to ensure that their gaming consoles offer the latest technology and features to attract both casual and enthusiastic gamers. This includes faster processing speeds, improved graphics, better audio quality, and more interactive gameplay experiences. The console makers may also strike deals with game publishers to acquire exclusive game titles, ultimately making their consoles more appealing to potential buyers. In conclusion, the text is about the business strategies employed by game publishers and hardware makers during the holiday season. They compete to win consumers' attention and spending by releasing high-profile products and investing in various marketing and development activities. Thus, this passage falls under the \\"Business\\" category (Option 3)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Question: \\"What group did Atta join that failed at trying to bring together two religions?\\" Response: \\"Al Qaeda\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The correct answer is that Atta joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which aimed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How much did Zombie offer for Victor Crowley's head? 5000 The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"5000: The Hunt for Victor Crowley's Bounty\\" Step 1: Establish the main characters and setting  - Setting: A dystopian, post-apocalyptic world where zombies led by Zombie Overlord, have overrun the cities.  - Protagonists: A group of survivors - Jack (an ex-military officer), Luna (a nurse), Sam (a conspiracy theorist), and Sarah (a mechanic).  - Antagonist: Zombie Overlord and his henchman, The Butcher - a terrifying reanimated figure from the past, Victor Crowley. Step 2: Set up the conflict Zombie Overlord puts a bounty of 5000 for anyone who can bring him Victor Crowley's head. He believes that obtaining Victor Crowley's head will amplify his power and dominance. Step 3: The protagonists' motivation The survivors learn about the bounty on an intercepted radio transmission. Sam, the conspiracy theorist, convinces the group that obtaining Victor Crowley's head might unlock a hidden weakness in Zombie Overlord, as no enemy rewards such a high bounty without reasons. The group decides to hunt Victor Crowley and use his head to weaken the Zombie forces. Step 4: The journey and challenges The protagonist group travels through treacherous territories infested with zombies and other hostile groups. They gather clues and piece together the history of Victor Crowley's disturbing origins. They overcome various obstacles, strengthen their camaraderie, and save survivors on their way. Step 5: The conflict with Victor Crowley Guided by Sam's research, the group locates the lair of Victor Crowley, known as, \\"The Butcher\\", and enters into a terrifying battle. Facing traps, deadly weapons, and the relentless persistence of a supernatural killer, the group must rely on their wits and skills to survive. Step 6: The downfall of Victor Crowley Despite losing one of their own (Sam), the protagonist group manages to defeat Victor Crowley. Luna, with her medical knowledge, discovers a dormant weakness in Crowley's anatomy, which they exploit to neutralize and defeat him, obtaining his head. Step 7: Final showdown with Zombie Overlord Armed with Victor Crowley's head, the surviving group confronts Zombie Overlord. Jack, the ex-military officer, enacts a plan to utilize the head's potential power against Zombie Overlord. The head reveals a hidden source of Zombie Overlord's power, and Jack disables it, resulting in a loss of control over the zombie hordes. Step 8: Resolution and hope for a better future With Zombie Overlord defeated and the zombies in disarray, the survivors take the opportunity to unite the remaining humans and begin rebuilding society. Though the future remains uncertain, Jack, Luna, and Sarah find solace in knowing they've given humanity a fighting chance. In summary, \\"5000: The Hunt for Victor Crowley's Bounty\\" revolves around a group of survivors who attempt to hunt down Victor Crowley, and use his head's potential power to defeat Zombie Overlord, who had offered a bounty of 5000 for Crowley's head. Along the way, the group faces adversity and makes sacrifices, ultimately empowering humanity with new hope in a dystopian world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who considered himself a true Parisian? , can you please find it?   Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher...

Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs  when you are working in a noisy environment.

Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes later in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of Emir Feisul's Syrian army. Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough.

So, what's the best answer to the question? Available choices: - less wind - dry soil - coastlines - flooding - rivers - streams - increase in top soil - mulch","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What enhances the effects of erosion?\\" based on the hints provided by your teacher is \\"dry soil.\\"  Here's a detailed explanation: Erosion is the process of wearing away rocks, soil, and other natural materials by wind, water, or ice. Several factors can enhance the effects of erosion, and understanding these factors can help us prevent or mitigate the consequences of erosion on the landscape. Your teacher mentioned that being exposed to wind can cause erosion of soil, which is true. Wind erosion is prominent in areas with less vegetation and dry, loose soil. The wind can pick up particles of soil and deposit them elsewhere, which is known as deflation. This process can cause significant loss of topsoil, resulting in decreased soil fertility and potential damage to structures or infrastructure located near the eroding area. Another hint your teacher provided is that wind erosion can remove significant quantities of soil from bare, dry lands. This indicates that the presence of dry soil contributes to the enhanced effects of erosion. In areas with dry soil, there is typically less cohesion among soil particles, making it easier for the wind to displace them. Additionally, dry soil is more susceptible to compaction and crusting, which can further increase the vulnerability of the soil to wind erosion. While some of the other answer choices do contribute to erosion (such as coastlines, flooding, rivers, and streams), the hints provided specifically point to the effects of wind erosion on dry soil.  Therefore, the best answer in this case is \\"dry soil,\\" as it aligns with the information provided by your teacher and highlights one of the key factors that enhance the effects of erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Imagine you have -60 cookies, and you want to share them with your friend. Now, let's say your friend wants to give you some of his cookies. He has 18 cookies and 54 cookies which he wants to combine and give you. So, first, we need to add his 18 cookies and 54 cookies together: 18 + 54 = 72 cookies Now, the math problem looks like this: -60 * p - 132 = 72 * p Next, let's see how many total cookies your friend will have after combined. To do that, we will add the number of cookies your friend has (72 * p) to the number of cookies you have (-60 * p). First, set them up with the same sign: -60 * p - 132 = 72 * p -60 * p + (-132) = 72 * p Now, let's add your friend's cookies to yours: -60 * p + (-132) - 72 * p = 0 Add both amounts together: -132 * p = -132 Now, let's pretend you guys made a deal that if you solve this problem, you'll get the same number of cookies as your friend. To find out how many cookies each person gets, we'll divide the -132 cookies by -132: -132 * p / -132 = -132 / -132 p = 1 So, the solution is p = 1.

Lake Erie's northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake by water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native Americans people who lived along its southern shore. That Iroquoian tribe called it \\"\\"Erige\\"\\" \\"(\\"cat\\")\\" because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature. It is a matter of conjecture whether the lake was named after the tribe, or if the tribe was called \\"\\"Erie\\"\\" because of its proximity to the lake.  - MGen Robert \\"Bob\\" Ringma (30 June 1928  31 March 2014) was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 1997.

Q: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure. It means that the President could commit capital treason, or any other federal crime, and then immediately pardon himself. \\"It means that he could commit murder in the White House,\\" Koppelman said. \\"It makes no sense within the Constitution as a whole.\\" Asked by reporters Monday about Trump’s comment on his ability to pardon himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly replied: \\"The... According to the above context, answer the following question. Why does Boch say it's a bad idea for Trump to pursue a pardon? A:","output":"Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University, believes it's a bad idea for Trump to pursue a pardon for several reasons. Firstly, no president has ever tried to pardon themselves, and it would be an unprecedented move, testing the constitutional boundaries. Secondly, Bloch thinks it is unlikely that a court would allow the president to pardon himself. If Trump were to attempt to give himself a pardon, it might lead to impeachment by most congresses due to the controversial nature of the action. Finally, Bloch notes that when most people accept a pardon, it is often seen as an admission of guilt. Thus, if Trump were to pursue a pardon, it could be interpreted as accepting his guilt, which could be detrimental to his reputation and standing as the president."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER II  SOMETHING OF THE PAST  \\"The horses are running away!\\"  \\"Oh, we'll be killed!\\"  Such were the cries from the two girls as the mettlesome grays tore along the country highway at a speed that seemed marvelous.  \\"Dave, can I help you?\\" asked Ben, anxiously.  \\"I don't think so,\\" answered the young driver between his set teeth. \\"I guess I can bring them down. Anyway, I can try.\\"  \\"What shall we do?\\" wailed Jessie.  \\"Don't do anything--sit still,\\" ordered Dave. He was afraid that Jessie in her excitement might fling herself from the flying sleigh.  On and on bounded the frightened team. Each of the grays now had his bit in his teeth, and it looked as if it would be impossible for Dave to obtain control of the pair. And, worst of all, they were now approaching a turn, with the hill on one side of the roadway and a gully on the other.  \\"Better keep them as far as possible away from the gully,\\" suggested Ben.  \\"That is what I'm trying to do,\\" returned Dave, setting his teeth grimly.

Question: Background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.  Paragraph: The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question based on the following text.  Question:   As we cease working to develop things our technology levels as a species decreases or increases?    Text:  The development of better missiles fostered better rocket technologies.","output":"Analyzing the given text, it is evident that the development of better missiles has led to improved rocket technologies. This can be further understood in the context of technological advancements as a whole. As we cease working to develop new technologies or improve existing ones, the overall level of technology available to our species may either stagnate or decline. This can be attributed to multiple factors. Firstly, innovation is an essential aspect of any species' advancement. By constantly exploring new ways to address problems, improve existing solutions, and enhance efficiency through technology, we can achieve outstanding results that allow for greater convenience, improved understanding of the world, and progress in various fields. Thus, when we stop working on developing things, we prevent ourselves from being exposed to new ideas or opportunities for innovation, which could inevitably hinder our technological progress as a species. Furthermore, when the pace of technological development slows down, it could potentially lead to a reduction in investment and support for research and development activities. Governments, corporations, and institutions might redirect their resources to other areas if technological development isn't seen as a priority. This could have a cascading effect on the financial support mechanisms that usually fund the research and development of new technologies. Moreover, the collaborative nature of technological advancement also plays a part in determining our progress as a species. Often, breakthroughs in one field can have implications for other areas, spurring on further advancements. By halting the development of new technologies in one area, we could inadvertently slow down advancements in other fields. Taking the given text into consideration, the development of better missiles fostered better rocket technologies, which likely encompassed advancements in materials science, propulsion systems, guidance, and navigation, among others. This technological progress in rocketry could have broad implications for various industries, including space exploration, telecommunications, and military applications. In conclusion, if we cease working to develop things, there is a possibility of experiencing a stagnation—if not an outright decline—in our technological advancements as a species. For this reason, it is crucial for our progress that we continue to innovate, collaborate, and seek better solutions to create a future filled with technological marvels and enhanced capabilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.  and a hint : In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  Please answer this question : Which town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions?

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis are related, but does not necessarily entail one another directly. The entailment deals with the logical connection between the statements and the conclusion that can be drawn when one statement is true or false. Firstly, let us break down the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Oh! I said, rather nonplussed.\\" The premise here indicates that the speaker expressed their reaction (saying \\"Oh!\\") to something while feeling nonplussed. The term \\"nonplussed\\" means to be surprised, confused, or unsure about how to react to a particular situation. Hypothesis: \\"I wasn't sure what to think.\\" The hypothesis here suggests that the speaker was uncertain about their thoughts or feelings about a situation, which can align with the feeling of being nonplussed. Now, let's consider the relationship between the two statements: 1. Does the premise imply that the hypothesis must be true? If someone is nonplussed, it generally implies they are puzzled, confused, or unsure about what to think or feel in response to a situation. In this sense, there is an alignment between the premise and the hypothesis. However, being nonplussed does not always explicitly imply not being sure about what to think – it can simply indicate a momentary confusion or surprise. 2. Does the hypothesis imply that the premise must be true? It is not a requirement for someone who is unsure about what to think to be nonplussed. Uncertainty about one's own thoughts can arise from different emotional states or situations, not just those that evoke a feeling of being nonplussed. For example, someone can be uncertain about what to think while feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or indecisive. In conclusion, while the premise and the hypothesis may share a certain degree of similarity in the emotional state they describe, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, and vice versa. The premise could be an instance that supports the hypothesis, but it is not the only way to support it, nor does it provide conclusive evidence that the hypothesis stands true. It is important to consider other factors or context surrounding these statements in order to establish a more concrete relation between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Anjem Choudary among nine arrested in London anti-terrorism raid Anjem Choudary, one of the most high profile Islamists in Britain, has been arrested by police for allegedly encouraging terrorism. Choudary, 47, was one of nine men arrested by officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command on Thursday morning. Police gave only sparse details, but the men were arrested on suspicion of being members of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation, as well as encouraging terrorism. Choudary gained publicity for statements over the years which inflamed some people, but which stayed on the right side of the law. He is a former lawyer, self styled preacher and says he is an expert in Islamic or Shariah law. On Thursday morning his phone was uncharacteristically switched off and a chat group he uses to communicate his message through was silent and saying it was last viewed at 5.33am. The men arrested were aged from 22 to 51 years old and were all detained in London. Police said a total of 19 addresses were being searched, mostly in London. Police said community premises were being raided, as well as residential and business addresses. One address is in Stoke-on-Trent in the Midlands, eleven in east London, one in west London, one in north-west London and five in south London. Neighbours said Choudhury appeared to move out of his semi-detached home in Walthamstow, north-east London, last week and that there was significant police activity at the address over the weekend. “The police activity was definitely last week,” said one neighbour, who declined to be named. “Police officers came round and went up the doorstep - two were walking around constantly and there were three police cars parked down the road. They were in pairs. A police car came round a few times. Later that evening I saw the light on upstairs after the police had gone.” The neighbour added that Choudhury lived in the house for two or three years but removed some belongings last week. “We’ve had leaflets from rightwing groups put though our door saying do you know he lives down your street,” the neighbour said, adding that they were on “nodding terms” with Choudhury. Another neighbour, Derek Rayner, 70, said Choudhary “kept himself to himself” but was not popular with local residents. “He hasn’t done me any harm personally and he hasn’t done his neighbours any harm but I just don’t want him on my doorstep,” Rayner said. On Thursday morning the property where Choudhary lived was covered in scaffolding, with a number of workers leaving and entering the house.

Question: Sales of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, a hot item in consumer green tech, are expected to grow by more than 50% in North America during 2013. Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife.  I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as  traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description. Which of the following about e--bikes is true? A) The cheaper e-bikes are usually made of lighter materials. B) Most e-bikes in the l,000 range are a bicycle, not a motor vehicle. C) Local motor vehicle law doesn't have any limit to e-bikes. D) E-bikes in the l,000 range are too cheap to have better batteries.

Ronan Farrow, the biological son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, distinguishing him as one of the country's brightest thinkers. But given their estranged relationship, it is unlikely that Woody will be celebrating along with him. Ronan, 23, and Woody, 75, had a very public falling out when Woody began a romantic relationship with Mia's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 years his junior. Young leader: Ronan Farrow has worked as a UNICEF spokesman and as a special appointment in the State Department. 'He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said. 'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship. Ronan has not seen much of Woody since his romantic relationship with Soon-Yi began in 1992 when Ronan was only five years old. Earlier bonds: Woody Allen and Mia Farrow walk as Mia carries their son Satchel, who later changed his name to Ronan. Together: Woody and Mia were a couple for 12 years before it ended in 1992 when Farrow found naked pictures of her adopted daughter in Woody's home. Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Mia split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three children. Prodigy: Ronan graduated from Bard College at 15 and Yale Law School at 21. During the proceedings, which were closely followed, Mia claimed that Woody had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims because they were not substantiated. Mia was awarded full custody, and Woody was only allowed to have supervised visits with Ronan, originally named Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow. Woody was denied visits with Dylan, who later changed her name to Malone, and the couple's other adopted child Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Woody at all. In a PBS documentary titled American Masters, Woody is profiled in detail about his work and Soon-Yi is seen in clips. He never mentions Ronan in the entire three-and-a-half hour series, the second portion of which airs tonight. In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with Mia. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. The strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back, and he has been deemed a child prodigy. Controversial: Woody and Soon-Yi have been married since 1997 and have two adopted children together. He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree. Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009. After working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination. This year, 32 Americans have been nominated for the scholarship that will pay for the expenses of a year of study at Oxford University. Family outing: Ronan seen here with his mother and half-brother Fletcher Farrow Previn, was raised by his mother after she won full custody in 1992. For a man known for his many neuroses, Woody Allen hasn't let that stop him from enjoying his love life. The famous New Yorker has been married three times, in addition to a number of multi-year relationships with actresses Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow. Ronan is his only biological son, but he has four adopted children- two that he adopted with Mia and two with his current wife Soon-Yi. He first married at age 19 to a 16-year-old girl named Harlene Rosen, and that marriage lasted for five years. Undeterred, Woody married actress Louise Lasser, and though they divorced three years later, she continued to work with him and was featured in three films after they ended their romantic relationship. The recent release of Diane Keaton's autobiography gives a glimpse into their partnership, and while it only lasted a year, their professional one lasted much longer with Ms Keaton serving as his muse for such films as Annie Hall. 'He was even better-looking in real life. He had a great body, and he was physically very graceful,' Keaton writes in her book. Keaton was not his first relationship that played out on the big screen, as Woody was rumored to have dated a 17-year-old student Stacey Nelkin in the 1970s and she was said to be the inspiration for his 1979 film Manhattan. Woody's relationship with Mia Farrow, which began in 1980, was quite the Hollywood pairing, ending in explosive Hollywood fashion. Mia had previously been married to Frank Sinatra and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work in Rosemary's Baby, so she was famous in her own right when she and Woody started their relationship. The couple never married but were together for 12 years. Mia had three biological children and three adopted children from a previous relationship, one of which was Soon-Yi Previn who Mia adopted from Korea at the age of 8 years old. When she and Woody were together, the couple adopted two more children and she gave birth to their son Ronan. In 1982, Mia found naked photos of Soon-Yi, who was 21 at the time, on Woody's mantelpiece. This discovery prompted a torrid legal battle between Mia and Woody over the custody of their children. Woody was denied access to their daughter Dylan, allowed only supervised visits with Ronan, and their eldest son Moses was given the choice- and decided not to see his father. In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children with from his relationship with Mia. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair. In spite of the drama, Soon-Yi and Woody stayed together, eventually marrying in 1997. The couple have since adopted two children named Bechet and Manzie Tio, their names paying homage to two jazz musicians. 'The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to those things,' Woody has said. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Q: The galápagos islands are a group of 16 volcanic islands 600 miles off the west coast of what continent?   Choices:  - north america  - europe  - asia  - south america  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"South America. Based on the provided paragraph, the Galápagos Islands are a group of 16 volcanic islands situated 600 miles off the west coast of South America. The islands are well-known for their unique species that are not found anywhere else in the world. Furthermore, it is on these islands where the renowned scientist Charles Darwin started to develop his groundbreaking theory of evolution. The Galápagos Islands play a significant role in the understanding of biodiversity, with a wealth of endemic species that have evolved in isolation due to their remote location. This geographical isolation has led to the development of distinct and unique ecosystems, which in turn provided invaluable data and observations for Darwin's research. The Galápagos Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, and apart from their distance from South America, they are also quite far away from the other continents mentioned as choices: - North America: Though still in the Western Hemisphere, North America is separated from the Galápagos by both South America and a large portion of the Pacific Ocean. - Europe: Across the Atlantic Ocean to the east of South America, Europe is thousands of miles away from the Galápagos Islands. - Asia: On the far eastern side of the world relative to the Galápagos, Asia is situated across the massive expanse of the Pacific Ocean. In summary, the Galápagos Islands' location 600 miles off the west coast of South America makes this continent the correct answer among the given choices. These islands are incredibly important for biodiversity study and played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of evolution thanks to Charles Darwin's work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make wine (wine grapes). While almost all of them belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced \\"100% grape juice\\", made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.

Question: \\"What would indicate that everything is okay?\\"  Context: \\"If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his in pectore appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of the appointment of an in pectore cardinal, the term \\"everything is okay\\" can be understood as a situation wherein the conditions are deemed favorable and safe for the Pope to publicly announce the identity of the in pectore cardinal without jeopardizing the individual's safety, the interests of the Church, or the broader political and social contexts. Various factors may contribute to assessing whether \\"everything is okay,\\" including the following: 1. Personal safety of the in pectore cardinal: One reason for a cardinal to be appointed in pectore is to protect the individual's safety in cases where revealing their identity might put them at risk. If the individual's safety can be reasonably assured, this might indicate that everything is okay for the announcement to be made public. 2. Stability of the local church and community: The Pope may have appointed the in pectore cardinal to protect a vulnerable local church or Christian community. If there is significant improvement in the stability and wellbeing of that community, it may suggest that everything is okay for the cardinal's identity to be revealed. 3. Diplomatic or political factors: Sometimes, the disclosure of an in pectore cardinal's identity may have political or diplomatic ramifications. If tensions have eased between the Holy See and the government, or if the government's attitude towards the Church has become more favorable, it may be an indication that everything is okay for the announcement to be made. 4. Changes in leadership: If there has been a change in leadership, either within the Church or secular authorities, that creates a more favorable environment for the cardinal's appointment, it may be a sign that everything is okay for the Pope to reveal the identity of the in pectore cardinal. 5. The Pope's judgment: Ultimately, the decision to disclose or not to disclose the identity of an in pectore cardinal will be guided by the Pope's judgment of whether it is safe and appropriate to do so. The Pope's assessment of the various factors leading to the appointment of the cardinal will play a crucial role in determining if everything is okay. 6. Support from other ecclesiastical authorities: If other ecclesiastical authorities within the Church, such as members of the Roman Curia or other cardinals, express support and affirmation of the in pectore cardinal's appointment, this may be another signal that everything is okay for the Pope to proceed with the public announcement. In conclusion, determining if \\"everything is okay\\" for revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal is a complex process that depends on several factors, including personal safety of the cardinal, the stability and wellbeing of the local church and community, diplomatic and political considerations, changes in leadership, consultation with ecclesiastical authorities, and ultimately, the Pope's judgment. When these various conditions have been assessed and the Pope deems it safe to make the appointment public, it can be considered that everything is okay for the cardinal's identity to be disclosed and the individual can rank in precedence alongside other cardinals appointed at the time of their in pectore appointment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Decide when you've made a choice to be bored. Article:","output":"Title: Overcoming Student Boredom: Identifying Root Causes and Implementing Engaging Strategies Introduction Boredom is a common emotion experienced by many students, affecting their ability to focus, engage, and learn in the classroom. A recent study has revealed that around 63% of students feel bored at least once during a school day, emphasizing the need for both educators and students to address this issue. The first step in overcoming boredom is to identify its underlying causes. In this article, we will examine common triggers, discuss when a conscious decision to be bored might be at play, and offer possible solutions for students and educators. Identifying the Types of Boredom 1. Subject-specific boredom: In some cases, boredom might be confined to specific subjects rather than affecting a student's entire academic experience. Perhaps a particular subject lacks personal interest, is perceived as too difficult, or seems disconnected from real-life relevance. 2. Teaching style: A teacher's style plays a significant role in engaging students. For some, a lecture-based approach might not resonate, leading to disinterest and disconnect. In this case, boredom might stem from a lack of suitable teaching methods or the absence of the student's preferred learning style. 3. Environmental factors: Certain environmental factors can impact a student's ability to concentrate, such as overcrowded classrooms, excessive noise, uncomfortable seating, or inadequate lighting. In such cases, boredom might manifest as a consequence of an uncomfortable physical environment. 4. Emotional and psychological factors: If a student feels unsupported, unchallenged, or overwhelmed by personal circumstances, they may become bored academically. Here, emotional and psychological factors create a barrier to engagement and contribute to the experience of boredom. When a Choice to be Bored is Made There are times when students consciously make the choice to be bored. Passive engagement, or the act of choosing not to participate actively in class-related activities, can be a catalyst for boredom. This voluntary detachment is often a coping mechanism used to avoid the pressure of academic performance, peer judgment, or fear of failure. Identifying when a choice to be bored has been made is crucial in combating the issue. Strategies for Overcoming Boredom 1. Evaluate personal interests: Students should evaluate their interests and identify topics of personal significance. Learning to connect academic subjects with real-life relevance, such as hobbies or future career goals, can stimulate curiosity and promote engagement. 2. Communicate with educators: Establishing open communication with teachers can clarify expectations and enable discussions about alternative learning methods. Students can express their preferred learning style or suggest ideas for diverse teaching methods that align with their interests. 3. Address environmental factors: If environmental factors are the root of boredom, schools should consider making necessary adjustments to create an optimal learning environment. Students can also take personal responsibility by selecting better seating arrangements or utilizing aids that decrease distractive stimuli. 4. Confront emotional and psychological barriers: Students should not shy away from addressing emotional or psychological factors impacting their engagement. Speaking with a guidance counselor or mental health professional can be an effective way to develop coping mechanisms and foster a more positive outlook on learning. 5. Self-reflection and self-awareness: Students should regularly evaluate their choices and behaviors in the learning environment. Identifying when boredom is a result of passive engagement will help in making a conscious effort to participate and challenge oneself in the future. Conclusion Addressing boredom in students requires a comprehensive understanding of its root causes and active participation from both students and educators alike. By identifying the underlying triggers, whether they be subject-specific, teaching style related, environmental factors, or emotional and psychological barriers, students can develop targeted strategies to engage more effectively in their learning journey. Through thoughtful self-reflection, open communication, and a willingness to challenge oneself, both students and teachers have the power to transform dull classrooms into thriving, inspired spaces for growth and learning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yusuke Hasegawa said it was his job \\"to convince\\" the double world champion of Honda's credentials before he made a decision on his future. Alonso is out of contract at the end of the season and says he will make a decision on his future in September. Hasegawa said Honda planned a series of updates over the next few races. The first of these is being introduced at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix and has led to a grid penalty for Alonso's team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne. The Belgian has a new power-unit that has led to a nominal 35-place penalty and means he will start from the back of the grid. Vandoorne is using what Honda calls its 'Phase 3.6' engine in Belgium, which features a change to the induction design. Alonso also has an upgrade - to the so-called 'Phase 3.5' engine - but Honda is allowed to do this without penalty because the parts that needed changing on his engine did not fall under those on which changes are restricted. Hasegawa said the improvements for this race over the specification of engine Alonso used in the last race in Hungary were worth about 0.1secs. Alonso said he was expecting \\"very difficult races\\" in Belgium this weekend and Italy next because they are the two circuits on the calendar where lap time is most dependent on engine performance. The 36-year-old Spaniard said on the pre-Belgian Grand Prix media day on Thursday that he had \\"not been told much (about the Honda upgrade) and I'm not expecting much\\". McLaren are in the process of deciding whether to drop their works contract with Honda at the end of this year, after three difficult seasons plagued by poor reliability and performance, and switch to a customer supply from Renault. A month ago, a move to the French company seemed the favoured option and it remains a possibility, but the chances of staying with Honda have increased over F1's summer break in August. Mercedes and Ferrari have already turned McLaren down and Renault are also said to be reluctant to provide them engines because the competitiveness of the British team's car means it is quite likely they would beat the factory Renault team and possibly even lead customer Red Bull. Alonso was asked whether he felt McLaren had a difficult decision to make over its engine supply in 2018. He replied: \\"I don't think there is any tough choice.\\" Alonso has said his \\"priority\\" is to stay in F1 but has also said he wants a competitive car so he can return to winning races. Hasegawa said he hoped to persuade Alonso over the remainder of this season that Honda could provide that in 2018. He said Honda were pushing flat out and would be introducing developments whenever they came on stream over the remainder of the season.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which group of animal is likely more fit, animal A of B?  Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator.  Hint: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding The answer to this question is:","output":"Animal B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Li Ming: Why do they do tha t?  Mum: To make the earth more beautiful. And to make our life better.  Li Ming: But I often see people on TV cut down many big trees. Why do they do that, Mum?  Mum: Hm, to make paper, houses, and to make our life better.  Li Ming: To make our life better, too? I just don't understand. Mum, why do many people go and plant trees on the same day?  What would the listener say? Answer:","output":"The listener, in this case, Li Ming, might say something like this in response to the conversation with Mum: \\"Ah, I see now. So, Tree-planting Day is a day when people come together to plant trees, focusing on the importance of environment conservation and making the Earth a better place to live. Though I understand that cutting down trees is also done for practical reasons, like making paper and building houses, it seems a bit contradictory. It's essential to find a balance between these actions and ensure that we are replenishing the environment by planting more trees. I'm glad that we have a specific day dedicated to tree-planting, as it raises awareness about the need for sustainable practices. It's amazing that so many people come together on this day to make a collective effort toward creating a greener future. Now I understand that tree-planting events on this day, promote a sense of unity and responsibility among people, making everyone aware of the role they play in preserving our environment. Such a combined effort can inspire others to join in, and it allows us to see the immediate impact of our actions as the number of trees planted grow. Mum, can we participate in Tree-planting Day activities? It would be great to not only learn more about the significance of this day but also contribute to making our Earth more beautiful and our life better.\\" In this response, Li Ming addresses both the importance of environmental conservation and the listener's initial confusion about the conflicting actions taken by people. The response also shows Li Ming's interest in participating in Tree-planting Day activities, highlighting that they now understand the significance of this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 1: Is Quora uniquely suitable for scientists with low frustration tolerance? Question 2: What are the top frustrations unique to Millennials in today's workplace? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking about two different topics. Let's break down each question to understand them more clearly. Question 1: \\"Is Quora uniquely suitable for scientists with low frustration tolerance?\\" This question focuses on the platform Quora and whether it is a good fit for scientists who have low frustration tolerance. Quora is a question-and-answer platform where users generate and answer each other's questions about various topics. The question's context suggests that the scientists in question might become easily frustrated with typical research or peer review processes, or perhaps the formatting of information in other platforms. Therefore, the question seeks to identify whether Quora can be a more suitable platform for those scientists. A detailed answer to this question might include an analysis of Quora's features, its user interface, and the type of content that's usually available there. Some advantages of Quora might include the ability to quickly find answers to specific questions, the presence of experts, and the community-building aspect of the platform. However, one may also discuss the fact that information on Quora is not always reliable or reviewed thoroughly by experts, which may be a downside for scientists who require accurate and specific information. Question 2: \\"What are the top frustrations unique to Millennials in today's workplace?\\" This question tackles the subject of Millennials and the frustrations they commonly face in the workplace. Millennials refer to the generation born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s to early 2000s. This question asks for the top unique frustrations these individuals face, which implies that there might be challenges specific to this generation that were not present or not as pressing for previous generations. A detailed answer to this question might include insights into the modern workplace, the expectations and values of Millennials, and how these factors can contribute to unique frustrations. Some potential issues could be the lack of job stability or job-hopping, the impact of automatization and AI on job opportunities, the increased need for adaptability and continuous learning, the work-life balance struggles, student loan debt, underemployment, and the need for regular feedback or a sense of purpose in their work. In conclusion, the first question is centered on Quora as a platform and its suitability for a specific group of scientists, while the second question is focused on the workplace challenges and frustrations faced by the Millennial generation. Although both questions involve the concept of frustration, they address separate issues and are not asking the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were supported by the United States of America.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Why did the Latin Americas Upper class support coup o'etats?\\" Possible answers: (I). yes; (II). no;","output":"(II). No; The sentence \\"Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were supported by the United States of America\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"Why did the Latin Americas Upper class support coup d'etats?\\" because it only states that military dictatorships were supported by the United States of America. It does not specifically address the reasons behind the Latin America's Upper class supporting coup d'etats. To provide a more valid answer to the question, we need to analyze and delve into the historical and social context of that time period in Latin America. Multiple reasons contributed to the upper class supporting coup d'etats, some of which include: 1. Preservation of power and status: The upper class in Latin America was often composed of landowners, industrialists, high-ranking military officials, and members of old, powerful families. They aimed to maintain their power and status and were therefore supportive of coup d'etats when they felt their positions were being threatened by democratically-elected governments, especially those with leftist or socialist ideologies. 2. Fear of communism and socialism: During the period of the Cold War, Latin America was a battleground for political ideologies. The United States was strongly against communism, and as a result, was willing to back right-wing military dictatorships in the region to prevent the spread of communism. Many members of the upper class in Latin America shared this anti-communist sentiment and were worried about the potential consequences of socialist policies, such as wealth redistribution or land reforms. This led them to support coup d'etats that aimed to overthrow leftist governments. 3. Economic interests: Latin America's upper class was heavily invested in various industries, such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. They often had strong ties to multinational corporations and benefited from the economic policies of right-wing dictatorships. These regimes consistently favored pro-business policies that served the interests of the upper class and foreign investors, while neglecting the needs of the working class and the poor. As a result, the upper class supported coup d'etats that aimed to maintain or establish such economic policies. 4. Authoritarian inclinations: Some members of Latin America's upper class saw strong, authoritarian leadership as a more efficient and effective way to govern their countries. They regarded democratically-elected governments as weak and incapable of maintaining order or addressing chronic economic and social problems. This led them to support coup d'etats that promised strong, authoritarian rule and an improvement in the overall governance. In summary, the sentence provided does not give a valid answer to the question about the reasons behind the support of coup d'etats by Latin America's Upper class. The answer should encompass a discussion of the preservation of power and status, fear of communism and socialism, economic interests, and authoritarian inclinations as the main factors that contributed to their support for coup d'etats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate... contains an answer for the question: In what year did the colony established by Robert Cavelier de La Salle fail?, what is it ?

Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States.  - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably.   - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.  - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\".  - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer bacteria divide and grow happens, how will it affect MORE SEVERE disease occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of fewer bacteria dividing and growing can have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process and the likelihood of more severe disease occurring. Let's go step by step to explain how this perturbation can impact the process: 1. Bacteria enter the body: Regardless of the perturbation hypothesis, bacteria will still enter the body. However, the fewer bacteria dividing and growing might result in fewer bacteria overall, which could potentially reduce the severity and effectiveness of the infection. 2. Bacteria start to divide and grow: Here is where the perturbation takes place. Fewer bacteria dividing and growing means that the overall bacterial population may not increase as rapidly, and there might be a lower overall bacterial count. 3. The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells: With fewer bacteria present and growing, there may be less competition for resources with our body's cells. This could result in less stress and damage to other cells, potentially reducing the severity of the disease. 4. Other cells cannot function properly: Since there are fewer bacteria present, the dysfunction of other cells in our body might not be as severe, allowing them to function better and cope with the bacterial infection. 5. We feel unwell: The overall feeling of being unwell might be reduced due to fewer bacteria and less impact on our body's cells. 6. The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins: With fewer bacteria dividing and growing, the production of toxins might be reduced, leading to less harm to the body. 7. Toxins harm the body: With fewer toxins produced, there may be less overall harm to the body, potentially reducing the severity of the disease. 8. The body tries to react to the toxins: The body's response to the toxins might be more effective due to the lower toxin levels. This could make it easier for our immune system to combat the infection. 9. The body's natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell: Although the body's natural defenses might still cause us to feel unwell, the overall reaction might be less severe due to fewer toxins and bacteria. In summary, the perturbation of fewer bacteria dividing and growing has a direct effect on the overall bacterial growth, toxin production, and competition with our body's resources. This, in turn, can have an indirect effect on the severity of the disease, as our immune system might be more effective in combating a less aggressive bacterial infection, potentially leading to a less severe disease outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Poll: Clinton maintains 50-point lead among Latinos Hillary Clinton is maintaining a 50-point lead over Donald Trump among Latino voters heading into the final weeks of the presidential election, and more Latinos now say they they're very interested in the November contest, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll. The poll found that 67 percent of Latino likely voters back Clinton in a four-way matchup, while just 17 percent back Trump. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein each garner three percent support. In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton leads Trump among Latino likely voters, 70 percent to 17 percent. Clinton's margins are similar to the advantage she enjoyed in a mid-SeptemberNBC/WSJ/Telemundo oversample of Latino voters. But the new data also show that interest in the election among Latinos has increased. That's a boon for the Democratic candidate as she works to build a winning coalition in an election cycle that pits two historically unpopular candidates against each other. Sixty-nine percent of Latino voters now say they are very interested in the election, compared to 60 percent who said the same last month. And more than eight in ten - 82 percent - say they are absolutely certain to vote, a share that rivals pre-election polling before President Barack Obama's win in the 2012 presidential election. Related: Clinton Holds 11-Point National Lead Over Trump: NBC/WSJ Poll What's more, the increase in interest in the election among Latinos has come largely from groups most likely to support Clinton, including younger voters, Democratic-leaning Latinos and those who speak primarily Spanish.

Movie title: The Missing Movie plot: Set in 1885 in New Mexico, an estranged father shows up at his daughter's ranch and it's made clear he isn't welcome back into her life. He abandoned his family years ago to \\"go injun.\\" His older granddaughter is kidnapped by a band of assorted thugs of different ethnicities who are taking her to Mexico to sell her into prositution. So dad, daughter and younger granddaughter take off to track down the thugs and get the daughter back.------------------------------\`The Missing' is set in New Mexico in 1885. Tommy Lee Jones stars as the estranged father of prairie doctor Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett), a young woman with two daughters trying to make a living in this isolated wilderness. Tommy Lee Jones had abandoned his family some 20-years earlier to live with the Indians. After a rattlesnake bite, the medicine man tells him that he must reunite with his family to save his life. Maggie hates her father and throws him out of the house. After he leaves, her oldest daughter Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) is kidnapped by a band of renegade Indians, who have already kidnapped several other girls to sell in Mexico. Maggie goes to town and tells the sheriff, but he cannot help, so she is forced to enlist the help of her father to track down the kidnappers. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Missing,\\" the father, Samuel Jones, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is bitten by a rattlesnake. He is treated for the rattlesnake bite by a Native American medicine man who advises him to reconnect with his family in order to save his life. This sets the stage for Samuel to return to his estranged daughter, Maggie Gilkeson's (Cate Blanchett), ranch in New Mexico. Maggie is initially very hostile towards Samuel due to his abandonment of the family years prior, but she reluctantly accepts his help after her older daughter Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) is kidnapped by a group of dangerous criminals, who plan to sell her into prostitution in Mexico. Unable to rely on the local authorities for help, Maggie and Samuel set out on a journey, alongside Maggie's younger daughter Dot (Jenna Boyd), to rescue Lilly and bring her home safely. As they track the kidnappers and navigate harsh terrain, the characters must confront their past and learn to rely on one another. Throughout this difficult journey, they also encounter various challenges and life-threatening situations, including the rattlesnake bite that Samuel has to endure. In summary, it is a Native American medicine man who treats Samuel Jones' rattlesnake bite in \\"The Missing.\\" This event plays a significant role in the plot, as it leads to Samuel reuniting with his family and subsequently assisting them in rescuing his kidnapped granddaughter. The movie is a blend of action, drama, and suspense, depicting a perilous journey where the characters must face not only physical obstacles but also overcome years of emotional turmoil to find the strength and unity to save their loved one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chuck Hagel as his nominee to become the next defense secretary and Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Adviser John Brennan as the nominee for CIA director on Monday, administration officials told CNN. Two sources close to Hagel have also been told to expect the defense secretary announcement on Monday, and additional sources - a senior administration official and a source familiar with the nomination - said Obama spoke to Hagel Sunday by telephone. The White House was calling senators' offices Sunday to inform them Hagel's nomination is imminent and to help build support for it, a source familiar with the nomination said. CNN reported Friday that the White House had told some senior members of Congress to expect the tapping of Hagel, and another source with knowledge of the nomination called it \\"locked down.\\" At the CIA, Obama plans to nominate Brennan to replace retired Gen. David Petraeus includes and acting CIA Director Michael Morell, according to a senior administration official. The announcement is expected Monday afternoon at the same time Obama nominates Hagel, the official said. Petraeus stepped down from his post in November amid revelations he had engaged in an extramarital affair with his biographer. Morell, a career intelligence officer who was serving as the spy agency's deputy director, stepped in as acting CIA director upon Petraeus' resignation. For Hagel, getting to the Pentagon will mean overcoming already vocal opposition from pro-Israel groups and others who object to his stance on Iran and Hamas. He has also faced opposition from gay rights groups, who were strong supporters of Obama's election campaigns, for a comment Hagel made in 1998 in which Hagel questioned whether a nominee for ambassadorship was suitable because he was \\"openly, aggressively gay.\\" He apologized for that remark in December. On Sunday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham labeled Hagel's expected nomination as \\"in your face,\\" expressing concerns on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" about Hagel's past positions on Iran and Israel, which have been the subject of scrutiny since his name was first floated as a potential defense secretary five weeks ago. MORE: GOP Senators: Hagel in for a fight Republicans have also struck upon comments in a 2007 interview that some perceive as anti-Jewish, when Hagel said the \\"Jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers.\\" They've also lambasted positions Hagel took as a GOP senator, including his opposition to unilateral sanctions against Iran, as well as votes opposing the labeling of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. He also opposed the \\"surge\\" of troops in Iraq favored by then-President George W. Bush and members of his administration. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said Sunday that Hagel would receive a \\"thorough vetting\\" just like any other presidential nominee. \\"Whoever is nominated for secretary of defense is going to have to have a full understanding of our close relationship with our Israeli allies, the Iranian threat, and the importance of having a robust military,\\" McConnell said on ABC's \\"This Week.\\" \\"So whoever that is I think will be given a thorough vetting. And if Sen. Hagel is nominated, he'll be subjected to the same kinds of review of his credentials as anyone else.\\" A veteran of the Vietman War, Hagel served, by a clerical mistake, side by side with his younger brother, and earned two Purple Hearts, one of those for saving his brother's life. His time in Vietnam would end up forging his thoughts about combat for the rest of his life, and defining his tenure on Capitol Hill as a U.S. Senator with an independent streak, often sidestepping his Republican colleagues. \\"Not that I'm a pacifist, I'm a hard-edged realist, I understand the world as it is, but war is a terrible thing. There's no glory, only suffering,\\" he is quoted in his 2006 biography.

In 2009 he opposed Obama's move to surge 30,000 troops into Afghanistan, telling the National Journal, \\"I'm not sure we know what the hell we are doing in Afghanistan.\\" Perhaps the most immediate issue facing Hagel if confirmed as defense secretary would be the future of the Pentagon's budget. Hagel has said in the past that be believes the Pentagon's budget is overweight. \\"The Defense Department, I think in many ways, has been bloated,\\" Hagel said in a September 2011 interview with the Financial Times. \\"So I think the Pentagon needs to be pared down.” CNN's John King, Athena Jones, Gloria Borger, Mark Preston, Dan Lothian, Lesa Jansen, Mike Mount, Kevin Bohn and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.

The Replacements were an American rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979. Initially a punk rock band, they are considered pioneers of alternative rock. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson and drummer Chris Mars for most of its career. Following several acclaimed albums, including Let It Be and Tim, Bob Stinson left the band in 1986, and Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist. The band soon recorded a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement and handed it to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis, and had also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay's Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.) He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, \\"Raised in the City\\", played. Jesperson played the song again and again. \\"If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in\\", said Jesperson. \\"I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode\\".  Jesperson called Westerberg the next day, asking, \\"So do you want to do a single or an album?\\" With the agreement of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980. Jesperson's support of the band was welcomed, and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later that summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday \\"New Band Night\\". They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping. \\"His enthusiasm kept us going at times, definitely,\\" Mars later said. \\"His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force.\\"  After the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone, Westerberg began to write new songs and soon had a whole album's worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, time spent in the studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album. Although not important at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records.

Answer:","output":"The name of the small rural town in South Australia that the Victor Harbor Road bypasses is Mount Compass. Located approximately 55 kilometers south of Adelaide, Mount Compass sits in the heart of the Fleurieu Peninsula and serves as a crucial point between Adelaide and the famous tourist destination of Victor Harbor. Mount Compass was established in the 19th century with its primary industries being dairy farming, market gardening, and timber. Over the years, the town has evolved into a vibrant community with the growth of agriculture, viticulture, and tourism industries. The Victor Harbor Road, which serves as the main route between Adelaide and Victor Harbor, was a busy road and an inconvenience for the local residents of Mount Compass due to the increased traffic flow, particularly during holiday seasons. To address this issue, a bypass was planned and constructed around Mount Compass starting in the early 2000s. The Mount Compass Bypass is approximately 6.5 kilometers long, running to the west of the town. It was officially opened on 17th December 2004, allowing motorists to safely navigate the route without passing through the town's center. The bypass has significantly reduced traffic congestion and increased road safety around Mount Compass, resulting in a more enjoyable driving experience for both travelers and the local community. Today, Mount Compass retains its charming rural atmosphere and has become a popular spot for tourists to visit, boasting beautiful countryside scenery, wineries, and a world-class golf course. Additionally, the town's local heritage, rich history, and vibrant community spirit make Mount Compass a unique and welcoming destination in South Australia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray).

While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel’s laws and was supported by the following observations: • During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete structures that are independent of other chromosome pairs. • The sorting of chromosomes from each homologous pair into pre-gametes appears to be random. • Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their chromosomal complement. • Even though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size and morphology, they have the same number of chromosomes, suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent. • The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome number as their parents.   Choices:  - receptors  - neutrons  - atoms  - chromosomes   A: Answer:","output":"chromosomes The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance states that during meiosis, each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their chromosomal complement. This theory is supported by several observations, including the random sorting of chromosomes from each homologous pair into pre-gametes, the equal number of chromosomes in male and female gametes, and the combination of gametic chromosomes during fertilization to produce offspring with the same chromosome number as their parents. In the process of meiosis, the cell undergoes two rounds of division to produce four haploid cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. The reduction in chromosome number is crucial for the formation of gametes, as it ensures that the offspring resulting from the fusion of these gametes (during fertilization) will have the correct chromosome number, maintaining genetic stability across generations. In humans, for instance, each somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes – 23 from the mother and 23 from the father. During the formation of gametes, the chromosome number is reduced to 23 through meiosis, so that when sperm and egg combine during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the proper chromosome count of 46. The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which is consistent with Mendel's laws of inheritance, has been further supported by advances in the understanding of DNA and genetics. It has provided an essential framework for the study of inheritance patterns and the role of chromosomes in transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school.

His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral.

The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy.

Answer the following question: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese   telecom group claims. Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \\"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage   of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation   will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \\"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest  100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile. Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953. Who are most likely to benefit from the 3G services at Mount Everest? A) The telecom firm. B) The local residents. C) Travelers to Nepal. D) Mount Everest explorers. Answer:","output":"D) Mount Everest explorers The installation of 3G services at Mount Everest will be most beneficial to Mount Everest explorers, including climbers, hikers, and mountaineering enthusiasts. With access to high-speed internet and communication services such as video calls, these individuals can stay connected with their friends, family, and support teams while undertaking their expeditions. This enhanced connectivity not only provides a means for sharing their experiences in real-time but also offers an additional layer of safety, as climbers can now communicate more easily with rescue teams and base camps in case of emergencies. Additionally, the availability of 3G services is also likely to benefit the numerous tourists who visit the Everest region each year as it can enhance their experience and contribute to an increased sense of security. While it is true that the telecom firm, TeliaSonera, would also benefit from the addition of the 3G services on Mount Everest, given their potential to expand their market share and attract more clients, it is the Mount Everest explorers who would experience the most direct and immediate advantages of these improved communication capabilities.

As team owners and club managers scramble to find a compromise that would ensure financial stability and sustainability, they are also evaluating alternative revenue streams, such as commercial partnerships, broadcasting rights, and merchandise sales, which can offset the impact of this tax. Furthermore, clubs will require strategic planning and cost management to ensure they don't go over budget when it comes to player salaries. Another potential cause for concern is the damage the tax could do to the competitiveness of French clubs on a European level, compared to their counterparts in leagues such as England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga, and Germany's Bundesliga. Already, French clubs have struggled in recent years with retaining and attracting top-tier talent, and this tax would only exacerbate that issue. Consequently, this could lead to a shift in the power dynamics within European football and a significant decline in the quality of play within the French league. To mitigate the impact of this tax, French clubs might be forced to focus on nurturing and developing homegrown talent, through investments in youth academies and local player scouting networks. This short-term strategy could help alleviate the financial burden of high-priced foreign players, while at the same time, fostering a longer-term vision of creating a pool of domestic talent that could compete at the highest level. This might also lead to greater collaboration between the clubs and the French Football Federation to ensure a stable and well-structured football ecosystem that benefits everyone involved. In conclusion, the French football clubs' worry about the new tax law is thoroughly justified, as it directly affects their financial growth and competitiveness on the international stage. It will take a combination of short-term cost management and long-term strategic planning, as well as potential changes in the legal and regulatory framework of French football, to counterbalance the negative effects of this tax. The football clubs, players, and federation will need to collaborate closely and innovate in new directions to protect the growth, revival, and sustainability of French football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"The equation you've provided is a simple algebraic equation with the variable m. You want to solve for m, which means isolating m on one side of the equation and moving all the constants to the other side. The equation given is 386*m = 380*m - 12. In order to solve for m, we can start by bringing like terms together by subtracting 380*m from both sides. This will begin to isolate m on one side of the equation. 386*m - 380*m = 380*m - 380*m - 12  This simplifies to: 6*m = -12  The next step is to isolate m by dividing through by the coefficient of m on the left-hand side of the equation, which is 6. (6*m) / 6 = -12 / 6  This division yields the solution: m = -2 Therefore, the solution to the equation 386*m = 380*m - 12 is m = -2. To check the solution, you can substitute -2 in place of m in the original equation and simplify both sides to see if it's equal. Substituting m = -2 in the original equation yields 386*(-2) = 380*(-2) - 12, which simplifies to -772 = -772, confirming that -2 is indeed the solution to the equation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: To clean an electric razor.","output":"The best way to clean an electric razor involves several steps to ensure its optimal performance and longevity. Different electric razors may have slightly different cleaning processes, so make sure to refer to the manufacturer's instructions. Here is a general step-by-step guide to clean an electric razor: 1. Unplug and disassemble: Safety comes first. Unplug the razor from the power source to avoid any electrical hazards. Carefully disassemble the razor according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, you'll need to detach the shaving head, foil or cutter, and any other removable parts. 2. Brush off hair and debris: Start by using a small, soft-bristle brush (usually provided with the razor) to gently brush away hair and debris from the shaving head, foil, and cutter. Make sure to brush in the direction of the cutting elements to avoid damaging them. 3. Rinse with water: If your electric razor is waterproof or water-resistant, you can rinse the shaving head, foil, and cutter under running water. Use warm water with a bit of dish soap or mild detergent to remove any stubborn residue. If your razor isn't waterproof, avoid using water and stick to the brush for cleaning. 4. Disinfect the blades: Wipe the exterior and interior surfaces of the razor with a cotton pad soaked in some rubbing alcohol. This will sanitize and disinfect the blades, preventing any bacterial growth. 5. Dry the components: Make sure to pat dry all the parts with a towel, and let them air-dry completely.

For 11 straight Summer and Winter Games — dating back to 1992 —  Bob Costas  served as the familiar and reliable face of the Olympics. But  Costas  is sitting out the PyeongChang Games and has passed the torch to Tirico  who will serve as NBC’s prime-time host  starting with Friday’s Opening Ceremonies. Tirico joined the network in 2016 after more than two decades at ESPN and was a daytime host of the Rio Games. He recently spoke with The Washington Post’s Rick Maese about his new high-profile assignment. Q: It’s not like you’re a newcomer to this broadcasting game  but did you seek out  Costas  for any advice? A: There’s been a longtime friendship there. I don’t think that’s overstating it.

I know I can pick up the phone during the Games  and if I have a question  I know I’ll get an honest answer.  Bob ’s the all-time best.  Bob  set a standard for the amount of times  he  did this and the way  he  did it that likely won’t be matched ever again. So I’m not replacing  him ; I’m following  him .

What is the answer to this question? what was the original purpose of the rhode island colony?","output":"The original purpose of the Rhode Island Colony traces back to the early 17th century when a group of English settlers, seeking religious freedom and a more tolerant environment than the Puritan-dominated Massachusetts Bay Colony, established the colony. Rhode Island, officially known as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, was founded by Roger Williams in 1636 in present-day New England, the United States of America. The primary purpose of the Rhode Island Colony was to provide religious freedom and separation of church and state for its inhabitants. At the time, England experienced an intense period of religious persecution and conflict, prompting dissenters to search for an accepting atmosphere to openly practice their religious beliefs and build communities based on tolerance and mutual respect. Therefore, Rhode Island Colony emerged as a beacon of hope for religious outcasts and political dissenters. Roger Williams, an influential theologian and a proponent of religious tolerance, was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his opposition to the rigid Puritan establishment, advocating for the insulation of civil matters from religious ones. As a result, Williams ventured southwards and formed the settlement of Providence in 1636, which later became the foundation of Rhode Island Colony. He was joined by individuals like Anne Hutchinson, who suffered a similar fate as Williams, banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony facing charges of heresy. Some key features that made the Rhode Island Colony distinctly different from other colonies in the 17th century include: 1. Religious Freedom: Rhode Island was probably the first colony to truly embrace religious freedom by not only allowing settlers to practice their faith without interference but granting full citizenship rights to people from diverse religious backgrounds. With this approach, Williams and other Rhode Islanders sought to create a secure and inclusive environment for diverse communities, including Quakers, Baptists, Jews, and others. 2. Separation of Church and State: Unlike the neighboring colonies, Rhode Island Colony refused to incorporate an established state church. This forward-thinking decision contributed significantly to the principle of the separation of Church and State, now recognized as a fundamental tenet of American democracy. 3. Political Independence: As a self-governing entity, Rhode Island Colony had a strong desire to preserve its political independence from England. However, it would not be until 1663, after a prolonged struggle for formal recognition, that Rhode Island would be officially granted a charter by King Charles II, guaranteeing specific rights and privileges. 4. Interaction with native tribes: Unlike the other colonies that engaged in frequent conflicts with native tribes, Rhode Island, under the leadership of Roger Williams, sought peaceful relations. Williams learned the Narragansett language and helped establish trade and mutual respect between the indigenous people and the colonists. In conclusion, the original purpose of Rhode Island Colony was to provide a haven of religious freedom and tolerance for individuals persecuted for their beliefs in England and other neighboring colonies. It also aimed to create an equitable and democratic society with a distinct separation of church and state while fostering mutual respect and interaction with the local indigenous population."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How does O'Barry show the delegates that the dolphin killings are happening?

Rick O'Barry, a charismatic and enigmatic environmental activist, discovers the disturbing truth behind the dolphin slaughters in Oceania. Armed with a passion for saving marine life and evidence of the gruesome killings, O'Barry's mission is to reveal this terrible secret to the world and put an end to the slaughter once and for all. The United Nations convenes a global environmental summit to address pressing marine and wildlife conservation issues. O'Barry sees this as the perfect opportunity to confront the delegates and expose the dolphin slaughterings. Knowing that diplomatic channels are often marred by bureaucracy and corruption, he devises an audacious plan to force immediate action. O'Barry straps a TV to his chest, containing the horrifying scenes of the dolphin massacres. He infiltrates the conference, disrupting the proceedings with his shocking entrance. With all eyes on him, he plays the gruesome footage of the killings, leaving the summit delegates speechless and horrified. The harrowing images of the innocent dolphins bring about instantaneous, visceral reactions from the crowd, forcing them to acknowledge the urgent need to protect these majestic creatures from unnecessary suffering. Rick O'Barry makes an impassioned plea to the international community, urging them to act swiftly to ban the slaughter and protect the dolphins of Oceania. However, a powerful and sinister organization operating in the shadows has a vested interest in keeping the dolphin killings going and will stop at nothing to silence O'Barry.

Since a diminished food supply would likely make it harder for birds to survive, we can reasonably deduce that more small-beaked birds would die on Bank island due to the lack of food. Answer: Bank island (B)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: Stephen Báthory was born on 27 September 1533 in the castle at Somlyó, also known as Szilágysomlyó . He was the son of Stephen VIII Báthory  of the noble Hungarian Báthory family and his wife Catherine Telegdi. He had at least five siblings: two brothers and three sisters. Little is known about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553 Báthory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Zápolya's supporter, Báthory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favour at Zápolya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, Gáspár Bekes. Báthory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Zápolya. After Zápolya's death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected Báthory Voivode of Transylvania. Bekes, supported by the Habsburgs, disputed his election, but by 1573 Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania. He subsequently attempted to play the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire against one another in an attempt to strengthen the Transylvania position. How many different roles did Báthory have as a supporter of Zápolya?","output":"Stephen Báthory had three major roles as a supporter of John II Sigismund Zápolya. These roles were: 1. Feudal lord: As a prominent member of the noble Hungarian Báthory family, he held a significant position in the hierarchy of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. His status allowed him to support Zápolya's cause from within the official power structure and provide resources for the struggle. 2. Military commander: Báthory's experience in the military made him an important asset for Zápolya's campaign. He took part in battles and acted as a key leader in their efforts to counter Ferdinand I and the Holy Roman Empire. His ability to coordinate troops and devise battle strategies was crucial in the ongoing power struggle. 3. Diplomat: Due to his connections both locally and abroad, Báthory served as a diplomat for Zápolya, engaging in negotiations and forging alliances. One example of this is when he visited Vienna and was subsequently put under house arrest for two years. Despite the setback, his diplomatic skills allowed him to remain a vital part of Zápolya's power base. In summary, as a supporter of John II Sigismund Zápolya, Stephen Báthory served in three distinct roles: feudal lord, military commander, and diplomat.

Write a title for this article: Danish entrepreneur Martin Nielsen never planned to live in Africa. He travelled from his base in London to Kenya in 2012 to spend three months working with 88mph, a seed investment firm based in Kenya, where he launched Mdundo, a mobile platform for downloadable African music. Originally, Nielsen intended to manage the business from Europe, but he soon relocated to Kenya after finding the local and regional market a much more attractive place for entrepreneurs. Martin Nielsen (left), Founder & CEO, MdundoCredit: Mdundo In three years, Nielsen’s business, Mdundo, has become one of the continent’s leading music service sites with more than 1,000,000 active users every month, mainly from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Nigeria. More than 25,000 musicians – well known, and undiscovered, from across Africa contribute to Mdundo, earning revenue every time a user downloads their music. Nielsen believes the same level of growth would have been impossible in Europe. He says there are many compelling reasons for entrepreneurs to consider relocating to smaller markets relevant to their business plans. Amy Guttman: Why did decide to relocate to Africa? Martin Nielsen: The startup space is less crowded here and the problems are much more visible. You cannot go for a walk in Europe without someone talking about starting a business to solve a problem that likely doesn’t exist. Here, problems are real and practical solutions are valuable. Guttman: Basing Mdundo in Kenya makes sense, since the business is Africa-focused. Why does it make sense for other founders to relocate to Africa? Nielsen: Three things stand out as being much easier for starting a business in Africa, than Europe. The way we clear rights here is very similar to Soundcloud because of the difficulty of acquiring music rights in Africa (for Soundcloud the issue is DJ mixes) and we follow the same monetisation philosophy than Spotify, however we build our products to tailor for a wide range of low end devices and we tailor our payment systems to mobile money solutions currently penetrating the African market.

He felt that he'd ruin his relationship with Jen if he took it further, and he didn't want to do that.  At the same time,  He fight that pushing farther might do what to something good? Possible A: found, destroy, construct, fix, produce  Why is \\"produce\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Produce\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it suggests the possibility of generating a positive outcome or result from taking the relationship further. The question clearly presents a dilemma that James is facing: he is torn between not wanting to ruin his relationship with Jen and considering the potential benefits of pushing farther. In this scenario, human common sense dictates that positive outcomes can be achieved if an action is carefully thought out and executed with the best intentions in mind. The term \\"produce\\" has a constructive connotation that implies creation, generation, or the bringing forth of something new or valuable. In the context of relationships, \\"producing\\" something positive typically suggests improved communication, stronger emotional connections, or reaching a milestone together as a couple. By associating this term with the possibility of pushing the relationship further, it gives a sense that there might be a silver lining or potential for growth if James decides to take this risk. This is in contrast to the other possible answers provided (i.e., found, destroy, construct, and fix). For example, \\"found\\" is not fully relevant to this particular situation, as it lacks a direct connection to creating a positive outcome or enriching a relationship. \\"Destroy\\" is clearly negative and would be counterintuitive to James's desire not to ruin his relationship with Jen. Similarly, \\"fix\\" implies that something is broken, which contradicts the initial concern James has about damaging a relationship that may not have any issues at present. Lastly, \\"construct\\" could also be seen as aligned with human common sense as it implies building something new, but \\"produce\\" might be more suitable as it encapsulates potential growth and creation of a thriving relationship for James and Jen. In conclusion, \\"produce\\" is the answer that aligns most closely with human common sense in this context. It acknowledges the complexities and uncertainties surrounding relationships and presents an optimistic outlook that suggests pushing the relationship further could lead to the cultivation of something good for James and Jen. This choice demonstrates the intricate understanding and intuition humans often have when it comes to decision-making, emotions, and interpersonal relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\".

In 2006, Haggard acknowledged having received a massage from a Denver, Colorado, man who said that the prominent pastor had paid him for sex over three years. Haggard also admitted he had bought methamphetamine but said he threw it away. Those statements led the Board of Overseers at New Life Church to fire Haggard as senior pastor.

The company says it plans to replace more than 60 separate policies for different products with one main policy. Privacy activists criticized last month's announcement. They are concerned that the new policy will make it easier to track the activities of users across Google's many products -- from Gmail to YouTube. Marc Rotenberg heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. He says Google's aim is to create a single unified profile  of its users. \\"We believe that not only is that a threat to privacy, we actually believe it is illegal, because last year Google entered into an agreement with the US Federal Trade Commission in which they said they would not engage in that kind of data sharing without the permission of their users.\\" Google says its new policy will make it simpler for users to share information across services like Google Search, Gmail and Google Calendar. And it says the new policy will help personalize each user's experience. Over time, it says, users can expect to see better search results, fewer unwanted advertisements and more content targeted to their interests. But Marc Rotenberg says in return, people who choose to use Google will lose control over the information they share. \\"The type of information you might provide for an e-mail service, for example, such as your address book, which contains private information, is different from the type of information that you might provide for a social network service where people purposely make information publicly available to their friends.\\" Mr. Rotenberg says these two kinds of services should be kept separate. \\"By trying to combine these two services, in our view, Google is actually undermining a very well established expectation of privacy, especially for popular Internet services like electronic mail.\\" Critics also see a bigger problem with Google's new policy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Food Network may need to wipe the egg off its face. It's being sued for stealing the idea and technique for a snow globe cupcakes how-to video by a woman who runs recipe site SugarHero.com.      During the 2014 holiday season, Elizabeth LaBau posted a recipe instructing people on how to use gelatin sheets and small water balloons to make edible globes — which, when placed atop a cupcake, transform an otherwise commonplace dessert into a holiday novelty. The dessert recipe went \\"viral\\" the next year thanks to a Facebook post, LaBau says, and it got so much traction that it crashed her website.      LaBau says her food passion is a full-time job and she relies on advertising revenue from her site to keep SugarHero afloat. That one viral post \\"more than tripled\\" her income that month, according to the suit filed Thursday in California federal court.      Given the success of the recipe, LaBau decided to create a how-to video and posted it on Dec. 3, 2016.      Three weeks later, she says, the Food Network posted a similar video on its Facebook page — and, now, LaBau is suing for copyright infringement, claiming it ripped off her work shot-for-shot and won't give her credit.      Copyright law does not protect recipes that are \\"mere listings of ingredients\\" — but it does protect original works of authorship, and the U.S. Copyright Office website states that may include \\"expression\\" of a recipe such as \\"a description, explanation, or illustration.\\" So LaBau's suit raises an interesting legal question as to whether her how-to video warrants protection while the underlying recipe does not.      \\"The Food Network video copied numerous copyrightable elements of Plaintiff’s work precisely, including but not limited to choices of shots, camera angles, colors, and lighting, textual descriptors, and other artistic and expressive elements of Plaintiff’s work,\\" writes LaBau's attorney William Bowen. \\"Defendants’ video as of the signing of this Complaint has garnered 145,000 likes and over 11,000,000 views, business and attention that would have gone to Plaintiff and her business but for Defendants’ wrongful acts.\\"      Food Network declined to comment on the lawsuit, which is posted in full below. ||||| Food Network Sued Over Snow Globe Cupcakes How-To Video https://t.co/mZYStTb4ad — ZenCupcake™ {Robyn} (@MyZenCupcake) June 4, 2017      Elizabeth LaBau’s holiday cupcake recipe was so popular it crashed her food blog.      It was clever, after all. LaBau, who runs SugarHero.com, had figured out a way to make edible snow globe cupcakes by coating small balloons in sheets of gelatin and letting them harden into translucent domes.      After lots of trial and error, she posted the the recipe to her website in late 2014. It went viral in the days that followed, garnering about 740,000 shares on Facebook — the traffic caused her blog to go dark temporarily — and tripling her site’s income that month. She would go on to describe it as her “signature recipe.”      LaBau continued to ride the recipe’s success last Christmas, posting a tutorial video showing how to make the cupcakes. Like her original post, the video was a major success for the do-it-yourself dessert maven, drawing millions of views in December alone.      Then along came Food Network with a video of its own, LaBau says in a new lawsuit filed in federal court in California.      About three weeks after she published her tutorial, LaBau alleges, Food Network produced a how-to video on snow globe cupcakes that was so similar that it constituted copyright infringement.      LaBau’s lawsuit calls the minute-long, made-for-Facebook video a “shot-for-shot” theft of her own. The camera angles are the same, she says, along with the colors, lighting, text and other elements.      Food Network “willfully and intentionally sought to appropriate” LaBau’s work “for their own profit without bearing the cost,” the lawsuit reads. “The time commitment of recipe development and the cost of ingredients, coupled with the time cost of photographing and videoing the cupcakes, was a substantial investment for Plaintiff, an individual who runs a website based solely on her own work.”      A Food Network spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.      Because recipes can’t (for the most part) be copyrighted, LaBau’s lawsuit focuses specifically on the video that helped popularize the snow globe cupcakes. It calls the video a “proprietary work” and says Food Network’s version infringes on multiple copyrightable aspects of it.      LaBau says her blog began as a passion project that bloomed into a full-time job “through years of hard work and late nights.” So when Food Network posted its video, it was not just taking her ideas but hurting her brand and depriving her of income, she alleges.      “Competing with numerous corporate food websites, often backed by large companies with deep pockets, is very difficult as an individual and requires endless work,” the lawsuit reads. It cites several awards and accolades SugarHero has won in recent years, including being named “Best Baking Blog” by Better Homes and Gardens in 2015.      LaBau said Food Network’s video caused her “severe distress,” distracting her from the normal business of running her blog, which features recipes for hundreds of holiday-themed desserts and other sweets. She said she contacted Food Network asking for it to remove the video or at least give her credit and attribution for her work, but to no avail. Her lawsuit seeks as much as 150,000 in damages per copyright infringement.      The two videos follow the same format as many cooking tutorials found on food websites large and small, with each step in the recipe demonstrated in short, user-friendly segments as upbeat music plays in the background. Food Network’s version shows more professional-level studio production, but some moments in the footage are strikingly similar to those in LaBau’s video. Whether those similarities constitute copyright infringement is, of course, up to a federal judge to decide.

(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (Associated Press)      PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (AP) — Marit Bjoergen made Olympic history and the United States women's cross-country team won its first medal ever — and it was gold.      Bjoergen won her 14th medal at the Winter Games by taking bronze with her Norwegian teammates on Wednesday in the team sprint. That made her the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, breaking the tie she held with Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen.      Jessica Diggins and Kikkan Randall led the way as the American women pulled off a huge upset in the same race. The only other American to win a medal in cross-country skiing was Bill Koch, who took silver in the 30-kilometer race at the 1976 Innsbruck Games.      The Americans posted the fastest time in the semifinals and started on the front row in the final. Diggins passed the Swedes and the Norwegians on the final lap to win the first Olympic gold medal for the United States in the sport. Sweden took silver.      The 37-year-old Bjoergen has won four medals at the Pyeongchang Games. She took gold in the women's 4x5-kilometer relay, silver in the 15-kilometer skiathlon and bronze in the 10-kilometer freestyle.

Article: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute      Forget diamonds in the sky — it may actually be raining diamonds on Saturn and Jupiter, according to two planetary scientists1.      Researchers have long wondered whether the high pressures inside the giant planets could turn carbon into diamond2, and even though some researchers dispute their claim, Mona Delitsky of California Specialty Engineering in Flintridge, and Kevin Baines of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, now say it is possible. They are laying out their argument this week at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences in Denver, Colorado.      In their scenario, lightning zaps molecules of methane in the upper atmospheres of Saturn and Jupiter, liberating carbon atoms. These atoms then stick onto each other, forming larger particles of carbon soot, which the Cassini spacecraft may have spotted in dark storm clouds on Saturn3. As the soot particles slowly float down through ever-denser layers of gaseous and liquid hydrogen towards the planets' rocky cores, they experience ever greater pressures and temperatures. The soot is compressed into graphite, and then into solid diamonds before reaching a temperature of about 8,000 °C, when the diamond melts, forming liquid diamond raindrops, they say.      Precious rain      Image courtesy of Michael Carroll Alien Seas: Oceans in space (Springer 2013 )      Inside Saturn, the conditions are right for diamond 'hail' to form, beginning at a depth of about 6,000 kilometres into the atmosphere and extending for another 30,000 km below that, says Baines. He estimates that Saturn may harbour about 10 million tonnes of diamond produced this way, with most of it made up of rocks no bigger than a millimetre and perhaps some chunks spanning 10 centimetres.      \\"If you had a robot there, it would sit there and collect diamonds raining down,\\" Baines says. Indeed, this is just what happens in a piece of sci-fi the authors wrote to augment a recent non-fiction book chapter4 on the science of Saturn's fluid atmosphere. In their vision of the year 2469, diamonds would be collected on Saturn and used to make the ultra-strong hulls of mining ships delving deep into the planet's interior to collect helium-3 for clean-burning fusion fuel. The diamonds must stay in Saturn to prevent havoc in financial markets on Earth.      Delitsky and Baines concluded that diamond would be stable inside the giant planets by comparing recent studies that experimentally fleshed out the temperatures and pressures at which carbon takes on different forms5, such as solid diamond, and others that modelled the pressure and temperature at different depths within the giant planets6. \\"We put together two pieces of information from different sources to conclude that diamonds are likely to be existing in the deep interiors of Saturn and Jupiter,\\" says Delitsky.      Thermodynamic objections      But others dispute the researchers' claim, arguing that these two gas giants of the Solar System are probably devoid of bling. David Stevenson, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, says the pair did not properly account for thermodynamics. Methane forms a very small fraction of the mostly hydrogen atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn – 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. In such dilute systems, \\"thermodynamics favours mixtures\\", says Stevenson. \\"It's the same thermodynamics that explains why a small amount of sugar or salt will dissolve in a large amount of water, especially at high temperature,\\" he says. \\"Even if you made carbon dust, it would just dissolve as it went down into the interior very very quickly.“      Luca Ghiringhelli, a physicist at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, Germany, is also sceptical of the pair's conclusions. His own previous research7 showed that the concentration of carbon is not high enough in Uranus and Neptune — which are several times richer in carbon than Jupiter and Saturn — to grow diamond from the 'ground up', building the crystals atom by atom. He did not model whether diamond could instead form by the compression of soot, but says it is premature to assume that would do so. \\"It is very optimistic to drive conclusions on the existence of diamonds on Saturn from the scarce data we have, and without a convincing model,\\" he says. That may give financial regulators one less thing to worry about in the coming centuries. ||||| [ Watch the Video: Are There Diamonds On Saturn And Jupiter? ]      Lee Rannals for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online      Scientists speaking at the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society say that Saturn and Jupiter may hold what many consider to be the key to a woman’s heart: Diamonds. And lots of them.      A team from the California Specialty Engineering and the University of Wisconsin, Madison said that Jupiter and Saturn could contain solid diamonds in their cores. The scientists say that liquid diamonds could also be found deeper inside the core because temperatures would be so high that the gems would melt.      Scientists have believed for some time that Neptune and Uranus likely contain diamonds deep below their surfaces, but this is the first time a team has reported similar evidence for Jupiter and Saturn. The diamond core on Neptune and Uranus would most likely stay solid because the temperatures inside these planets are lower.      “Previously, only Uranus and Neptune were thought to have conditions in their interiors that would allow the formation of diamond at their cores. It appears that the interior of Jupiter gets hot enough to reach the liquid diamond region of the carbon phase diagram, whereas the interior of Saturn includes regions of temperature and pressure where carbon could exist as solid diamond,” the researchers said in an abstract written about their findings.      According to the researchers, diamonds in the solar system’s two biggest planets formed from methane found in their atmospheres. During lightning storms on these planets, this smelly gas blasts apart to create fluffy, jet-black soot similar to what is found inside a fireplace. The team traced where the soot ends up by using calculations developed by scientists to look deep inside planets. They also used recent data showing how carbon reacts to high temperatures and pressures.      “As carbon descends through the atmosphere, amorphous carbon becomes graphite which then is converted into diamond, creating various strata of carbon allotropes according to their densities,” the researchers said.      Findings revealed that the sinking soot first turns into graphite, which is a form of carbon used in pencils. As the bits of graphite continue their journey to the center of the planet, the growing pressure and temperature squeeze and heat them into specks of diamonds floating in a sea of helium and hydrogen.      “This kind of study shows that we are still far from understanding the composition and structure of Jupiter and Saturn, two planets which are respectively about 300 and 100 times the mass of our Earth and were crucial players when the whole Solar System formed,” Tristan Guillot, planetary researcher at the Observatoire de la Cote d’Azur in France, told CNN.      Although the idea of mining for diamonds on another planet seems intriguing, Peter Read, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, says we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves. He told CNN that diamonds in these planets would look different than what we have on Earth, adding that they could be clouds of condensed diamond material.      Regardless of whether or not man will be able to actually utilize this resource in the future, the concept of a diamond core itself remains a subject of interest to scientists. The researchers said that Jupiter and Saturn could be holding “diamond rain” or even “diamond oceans.”      “At the boundaries (locations of sharp increases in density) on Jupiter and Saturn, there may be diamond rain or diamond oceans sitting as a layer,” the team said. “However, in Uranus and Neptune, the temperatures never reach as high as 8,000K (14,000 Fahrenheit). The cores are -5,000K (-8,500 Fahrenheit), too cold for diamond to melt on these planets. Therefore, it appears that diamonds are forever on Uranus and Neptune but not on Jupiter and Saturn.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"It may be raining diamonds on Saturn and Jupiter, according to planetary scientists Mona Delitsky of California Specialty Engineering and Kevin Baines of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

In my first year out of high school in college, I didn’t quite get along with one vocal pipsqueak of a guy. Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise. The next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by. To think of it, I had already taken a swipe at another guy whom I suspected of being behind the wheel less than an hour earlier. Professing some half-hearted disinterest, I thought and felt to myself that this episode wasn’t over - yet. Fast forward some 45–60 days later, this guy is suddenly absent from college for almost a week. Successive class lecturers note that it is not like him to skip classes without a valid reason. Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. “His car crashed.”, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut. But as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights. The van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks. He suffered a concussion and a shattered nasal septum from the impact and police issued the van driver a ticket for dangerous driving. Basically, he had joked about striking me with his car hit-and-run and I had later joked to that lecturer and the class that he had crashed his car - and it turned out I was right.

It is a ceremonial county and a historic county, covered by three unitary authorities: Bedford, Central Bedfordshire, and Luton.  - A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary biological processes, such as agriculture and anaerobic digestion, rather than a fuel produced by geological processes such as those involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, from prehistoric biological matter. Biofuels can be derived directly from plants, or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes. Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.  - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.  - Bedford is the county town of Bedfordshire, England. It had a population of 107,590 in 2011 together with Kempston but the urban area has a population of about 122,943.  - Luton is a large town, borough and unitary authority area of Bedfordshire, England. Luton and its near neighbours, Dunstable and Houghton Regis, form the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area with a population of about 258,000. It is located east of Aylesbury, west of Stevenage, north-northwest of London, and southeast of Milton Keynes.  - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving.  - Continental Europe, also referred to as mainland Europe, or, by Europeans, simply the Continent, is the continuous continent of Europe, excluding surrounding islands.  - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).  - Shuttleworth College is a further education college in the village of Old Warden in Bedfordshire , England . The college is part of Bedford College , and mainly offers courses and training related to agriculture and the natural environment .  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - Monoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest.   - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - The history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin.  - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.  - Biggleswade is a market town and civil parish located on the River Ivel in Bedfordshire, England. It has grown in population by nearly 10% over the past decade, primarily due to good transport links, being situated along the A1 road between London and the North, as well as having a railway station on the main rail link North from London (the East Coast Main Line). New housing developments mean that expansion is predicted to continue into the foreseeable future.  - Central Bedfordshire is a unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire, England. It was created from the merger of Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils on 1 April 2009. With a budget of £500m the unitary council provides over a hundred services to a quarter of a million people, and is responsible for schools, social services, rubbish collection, roads, planning, leisure centres, libraries, care homes and more.  - Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind. This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic, gravitational, and electrical properties and forces. On earth it includes: sunlight, atmosphere, water, land (includes all minerals) along with all vegetation and animal life that naturally subsists upon or within the heretofore identified characteristics and substances.  - A foundation degree is a combined academic and vocational qualification in higher education, equivalent to two thirds of an honours bachelor's degree, introduced by the government of the United Kingdom in September 2001. Foundation degrees are available in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, offered by universities, by colleges that have their own foundation degree awarding powers, and by colleges and employers running courses validated by universities.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - College (Latin: \\"collegium\\") is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, or an institution offering vocational education.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - Medicinal plants have been identified and used throughout human history. Plants make many chemical compounds that are for biological functions, including defence against insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effect on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to have beneficial pharmacology, but also gives them the same potential as conventional pharmaceutical drugs to cause harmful side effects. Moreover, plant material comes with a variety of compounds which may have undesired effects, though these can be reduced by processing.  - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some part of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather, and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.  - The East of England is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It was created in 1994 and was adopted for statistics from 1999. It includes the ceremonial counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. Essex has the highest population in the region.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea.   - A civilization, or civilisation (see spelling differences), is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification, symbolic communication forms (typically, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment by a cultural elite. Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming as an agricultural practice, and expansionism.  - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.  - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.  - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.  - Old Warden is a village and civil parish in Bedfordshire, England, just west of the town of Biggleswade. It has a population of 275, increasing to 328 at the 2011 Census. The village grew up under the protection of the Cistercian Wardon or Warden Abbey nearby.  - Edexcel, now known as Pearson - London Examinations, is a multinational education and examination body owned by Pearson. Pearson Edexcel, the only privately owned examination board in the UK, and part of Pearson PLC, is a portmanteau term combining the words Education & Excellence. It regulates school examinations under the British Curriculum and offers qualifications for schools on the international and regional scale. Edexcel is the UKs largest awarding organisation offering academic and vocational qualifications in schools, colleges and work places in the UK and abroad. It is also recognised internationally.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - A secondary school, often referred to as a high school or a senior high school, is a school which provides secondary education, between the ages of 11 and 19 depending on location, after primary school and before higher education.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - <onlyinclude> Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science, but not animal science, is often excluded from the definition.)</onlyinclude>  - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.  - An apprenticeship is a system of training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study (classroom work and reading). Apprenticeship also enables practitioners to gain a license to practice in a regulated profession. Most of their training is done while working for an employer who helps the apprentices learn their trade or profession, in exchange for their continued labor for an agreed period after they have achieved measurable competencies. Apprenticeships typically last 3 to 6 years. People who successfully complete an apprenticeship reach the \\"journeyman\\" or professional certification level of competence.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - The Isle of Wight is a county and the largest and second-most populous island in England. It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines.

(CNN) The family of a Mexican national fatally shot by police in Pasco, Washington, has filed a 25 million claim against the city alleging that three officers killed the unarmed man \\"execution style.\\"      Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was shot by police Tuesday after he allegedly hurled rocks at vehicles and Pasco officers.      The city and the police department weren't commenting on the claim, Pasco City Manager Dave Zabell said Saturday.      The case is attracting attention because a video posted on YouTube shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. The shooting has sparked local protests and anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force against an unarmed man who is a minority.      Zambrano-Montes' widow, Teresa De Jesus Meraz Ruiz, 32, and the couple's two minor daughters accused three Pasco officers in \\"the murder\\" of Zambrano-Montes, according to the claim filed Friday.      Antonio Zambrano-Montes      One officer, Ryan Flanagan, \\"has a prior history of official misconduct in civil rights matters,\\" the claim alleges. The other two officers are Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz, the claim said.      Flanagan is a nine-year veteran; Wright, a firearms instructor with eight years' experience; and Alaniz, an officer with two years on the job, officials said.      Mexican diplomat concerned      Meanwhile, the Mexican consul in Seattle, Eduardo Baca, wrote a letter Thursday to Police Chief Robert Metzger expressing \\"deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed Mexican national by police officers.\\"      JUST WATCHED Police shooting sparks outrage Replay More Videos ...

Police have alleged that Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers. Officers attempted \\"voice commands and low level force,\\" and used a Taser, police said, but those efforts were unsuccessful.      After two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force.

A very brief encounter occurred between Zambrano-Montes and police, \\"during which the officers may have tried to taser\\" him, the claim said.      Zambrano-Montes separated from the officer and walked away from them in the crosswalk, the claim said.      \\"He had his back to the officers,\\" the claim said. \\"At this point, the officers started shooting at Mr. Zambrano-Montes.      \\"After Mr. Zambrano-Montes reached the other side of the street and got on the sidewalk, he continued to walk away from the officers with his hands out where they could be seen, again showing that he had no knife, no gun or nothing else in his hands that would cause a threat to the three officers who were then lined up on the sidewalk behind ...

About 500 people gathered at a park to protest the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, who was killed Tuesday after three officers chased him through a busy intersection with their guns drawn. As he turned to face them, raising his arms, he was felled by their bullets.      According to police reports, Mr. Zambrano-Montes had been throwing rocks at cars and officers.      His death was caught on video by a bystander and the footage has been widely disseminated on social media, fueling anger among the mainly Hispanic population of this quiet agricultural hub in southern Washington State, and drawing comparisons to the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo.      “What happened could have happened to any family, to my family,” said Maria de los Angeles Perez, 42, who had come from nearby Kennewick to show her support. She began to cry softly as she signaled to her two sons, Santiago and Samuel.      Mr. Zambrano-Montes’s family has settled in the region — many came here more than a decade ago to gather apples and asparagus in local fields. Dozens of cousins, aunts and neighbors attended the event. “We cannot count on a just government,” said one cousin, Rosa Cisneros-Zambrano, 50, in an interview before the protest. “Only on a just God.”      Supporters held signs in English and Spanish, urging officers to “use your training not your guns” and calling for “protection, not intimidation.” One man, taking the microphone, yelled into the crowd “We are all Antonio.”      But the protest held less vitriol than those that roiled Ferguson in the days after Mr. Brown’s death. Leaders here called for peace and demanded that protesters remove masks. The event was capped by a performance from a man named Fermin Cruz, 42, who strummed a guitar and sang a song called “El Inmigrante,” about a man who wished he were a tree, so he would never have had to leave his homeland. As he sang, many women held each other.      Also at the protest was a group of four people who had come to show support for the Pasco police and set up folding chairs at the edge of the gathering.      The group included Kenneth Taylor, 60, a retired police officer whose partner was killed during a traffic stop. “Social media has the tendency to incite people,” he said, adding that people should wait until a full investigation had been conducted before drawing conclusions about whether the shooting was lawful.      “What’s upset me is the immediate conviction.”      Police departments in the area have been involved in four other fatal shootings in the last seven months, and this one has drawn national attention to police practices in the Tri-Cities area, a group of municipalities with a population of about 250,000.      The Pasco Police Department, in conjunction with neighboring departments, will conduct an investigation to determine whether charges should be brought against the officers. They have been placed on leave, pending the outcome.      The coroner of Franklin County has said that he will order an inquest into the killing, a rare move that will allow a jury of six to determine whether the killing was justified.      City officials chose not to participate in the demonstration — they did, however, listen to the protesters.      Mid-protest, Dave Zabell, the city manager, was standing at the border of the gathering, dressed in khaki colors. He could hear voices booming over the microphone — and he commended residents for their measured response to the killing. “They’re trusting the process,” he said. ||||| But here in Pasco, a city of 68,000 that is 56 percent Hispanic, the public killing has pierced the immigrant enclave, spurring protests that have attracted hundreds and highlighting a division between the city’s increasingly Latino populace and its power structure — the police, the city government — which remains largely white.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      While many Hispanics have found work and stable, if not particularly affluent, lives here, the killing has drawn attention to their lack of clout. And, as with blacks in Ferguson, it has intensified feelings among Hispanics that they remain second-tier residents, despite their deep roots here, defined by the many Latino shops that now dominate the main thoroughfare, Lewis Street.      “They had him like a deer, hunting him,” said Maria Paniagua, 41, a resident with six children. “What happens when one of my kids gets in a jam and runs. Will they shoot him down?”      Photo      Though Latino workers have been here since at least the 1960s, attracted by jobs gathering fruit and asparagus in the region’s vast fields, few have moved into law enforcement or city government. Of the city’s 68 officers, 14 are Hispanic. A dozen officers speak Spanish fluently, and some residents cite language barriers that complicate interactions with the police. The City Council has one Latino member. The five-member school board, which oversees a system that is 70 percent Latino, typically has one or two Latino members, but this year has none.      “People are finally getting their feelings out through this whole Antonio issue,” said Alicia Coria, 18, a former neighbor of Mr. Zambrano-Montes’s who moderated a recent protest, guiding a sea of Latino residents through local streets, signs and fists held high. “The Hispanic community is finally trying to have the power.”      All three officers involved in last week’s shooting have been placed on paid leave. One of them, Adrian Alaniz, a Pasco native, is Hispanic.      The shooting has caused soul-searching among some city officials, who, even as they urge the residents to wait for the results of an investigation, say the protests have uncovered anger bubbling below the surface.      “This was about more than just Antonio,” said City Manager Dave Zabell, who took over the job last August. “It’s part of a community emerging,” he continued, “and frankly, it’s welcomed.”      Mr. Zambrano-Montes was raised in Michoacán, Mexico. He came to the United States about a decade ago to work in the orchards, said family members, who described him as both caring — guiding newly arrived relatives — and troubled. His wife obtained a protection order against him several years ago, they said, alleging that he had abused her. She, along with their two daughters, eventually moved to California. Mr. Zambrano-Montes was in the country illegally and did not speak English.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      He was arrested for assaulting a police officer in January 2014. The police said he had thrown objects at officers and tried to grab an officer’s pistol. He pleaded guilty in June.      In recent months he was out of work and appeared increasingly depressed and disoriented, his aunts and cousins said, after falling from a ladder in an apple orchard and breaking both his wrists. Then, in January, he was trapped in a house fire where he was renting a room, which burned his belongings.      Video      “What I know is that he was alone, that his wife had left him, that he couldn’t see his daughters,” said his cousin Pedro Farias, 32. “I don’t know what his reasons were” for throwing rocks at the police, “but I know all of this affected him.”      There are some Hispanics who hold prominent positions in Pasco. Saul Martinez is a council member. Eight of 20 Pasco schools are headed by Latino principals.      And the Police Department said that it had worked to recruit Hispanic officers in recent years, recognizing the need to reach the group. An Explorer program is one of several recruitment efforts. Intended to train residents ages 14 to 21 in police practices, it has 15 enrollees, all but two or three of whom are Hispanic, said Capt. Ken Roske.

Community leaders cite several reasons, including apathy, lack of English skills and education, and the fact that many Latinos are not citizens and cannot vote.      “There are so many barriers, not only linguistic but psychological, that act like an obstacle,” said Gabriel Portugal, 61, a former vice principal who came to Pasco from Mexico in the 1970s. He is now part of a community group called Consejo Latino, which lobbies the municipality for changes that will help immigrants and their children.      The video has been a near constant presence here in recent days, played repeatedly on television news in crowded taco shops and bakeries, each time drawing the gaze of those perched over plates of pupusas or pan dulce. Reyes Juarez, 54, said that she had slept little since viewing it, imagining her own son gunned down each time she shuts her eyes.      “It’s like having the badge gives you the right to take the life of a Mexican,” she said.      The killing of Mr. Zambrano-Montes has also drawn attention to past accusations of police misconduct. One officer involved in the shooting, Ryan Flanagan, was a defendant in a 2012 lawsuit in which he was accused of using excessive force in 2009 against Maria Davila-Marquez, then 30.      According to the lawsuit, Ms. Davila-Marquez was walking to pick up her children from child care after work when Officer Flanagan stopped her, somehow confusing her with a teenage suspect. When she requested an interpreter, he refused, said her lawyer, Vito de la Cruz. Another officer arrived, he said, and Ms. Davila-Marquez’s hands were twisted behind her back and her face was shoved onto the hood of the hot car, causing burns.

Like Rush Limbaugh, many times, I refer to the  Washington Times often. I find The Washington Times National Weekly Edition  to be well written and right on top of the issues. In fact, The Times has repeatedly scooped all other news sources on major national issues like the Clinton  scandals. Perhaps more important, The Washington  Times National Weekly Edition  reports stories the  liberal news media intentionally ignores because it does not fit their version of the news. If you want to stay truly informed and get the facts about what's really happening in the world, I strongly suggest that you read The Washington Times National Weekly Edition.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You can use a jar, ziplock bag, or any sealed container. If you develop symptoms within two weeks of the bite, take the jar with you to the doctor. The doctor can send the tick out for testing.  If you want to save a tick for testing, do not squash it, burn it, or put it in alcohol. Simply put it in the container, and leave it until you are ready to test it. Medical testing can be expensive. Even if the tick carries a disease, it does not mean that you have been infected. Attach the tick onto a piece of paper with a sturdy piece of transparent tape, like packing tape. This will keep it contained until you can identify what type of tick it is. Different species are likely to carry certain diseases. If you become sick, this information can help your doctor make a diagnosis.  You can bring it to the doctor or you can look up different species of ticks online to identify it yourself. Black-legged ticks are more likely to carry Lyme disease while lone star ticks and dog ticks can give you Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If you do not want to save the tick, kill it with alcohol. Fill a cup or bowl with rubbing alcohol, and dunk the tick inside. Leave it for several minutes. This will likely kill the tick. Just to be safe, you should avoid throwing out a tick in the trash. Instead, wrap it in a piece of toilet paper, and flush it down the toilet. This will ensure that the tick is safely out of your home. Next time you go outside, try to prevent ticks from latching onto you. There are many things you can do to reduce your chance of a tick bite.  Apply an insect repellent containing DEET. If you have children, spray the repellent on for them. Use permethrin on all of your clothing and gear. This is usually available at outdoor stores. Check everyone for ticks after coming inside. Pay special attention to their arms, knees, waist, belly button, ears, and hair. Remember to check pets as well! After coming inside, put your clothes in the dryer on high heat for an hour to kill any ticks that might be hiding in your clothing.  Light-colored clothing will let you see ticks more easily. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and boots if possible. Tuck these into one another.

When translated to English, it means \\"No one is going to stick that disgusting worm into me\\".  This sentence appears to be an emphatic statement, expressing a strong objection or refusal towards something repugnant or unpleasant (in this context, the metaphorical 'disgusting worm'). It could be a slang or colloquialism in Czech language, thereby carrying a unique cultural context. The specific connotations and the intensity of the sentiment being expressed could depend on that cultural or situational context. In general, idiomatic expressions, metaphors, or slangs when translated literally might not convey the same connotations in the target language (in this case, English) as they do in the source language (in this case, Czech). Thus, to comprehend the nuanced meaning fully, a deeper understanding of the Czech language and culture could be beneficial.  Further, the tone of the sentence indicates a strong emotion, like disgust or repulsion, and the use of the future tense ('nebude strkat' translates to 'is not going to stick') suggests an anticipation of an undesirable action, but a firm decision to prevent it from happening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Yunus shares his plans during an interaction with reporters, thus reliable information is conveyed to the audience. 2. He explicitly states his intentions to create new things in the world, which implies an interest in innovation and potentially launching novel projects. 3.

Her father ran a hardware   store, and from him Estee learned how to be a successful salesperson. Estee learned from her uncle John Schotz, too. He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick   and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop. In 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe. After many tries she succeeded and began selling her products in some stores in London. But France proved even more difficult. The store Galleries Lafayette refused to sell her products.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Process:  - A machine called a pulverizer grinds the coal into a fine powder - The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burn more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace - The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam - Steam released from the boiler powers an engine called a turbine, transforming heat energy from burning coal into mechanical energy that spins the turbine engine - The spinning turbine is used to power a generator, a machine that turns mechanical energy into electric energy - This happens when magnets inside a copper coil in the generator spin - A condenser cools the steam moving through the turbine - As the steam is condensed, it turns back into water - The water returns to the boiler, and the cycle begins again -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More atoms become unstable happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. If more atoms become unstable, it could lead to a higher rate of decay or even potentially cause radioactive emissions in the coal. This increased instability might make the coal more hazardous, which could lead to stricter regulations and limitations on coal transport and usage, resulting in less coal arriving at the power station. Furthermore, if the coal becomes more unstable and hazardous, alternative energy sources might become more attractive and economical, leading to a potential shift in energy production. This would also contribute to less coal arriving at the power station."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.  - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively.

The paper was founded in 1885 by Axel Danielsson and August Palm, and existed up to 1944 when it changed name to \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" (\\"The Morning Paper\\"). \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" existed up to 1958.  - Västra Götaland County is a county or \\"län\\" on the western coast of Sweden.   - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Axel Danielsson (15 December 1863  30 December 1899) was a Swedish socialist agitator, journalist and writer, born in Värmland. He was a prominent leader of the early Swedish Social Democratic Party. Danielsson retranslated Karl Marx's \\"Communist Manifesto\\" into Swedish in 1886.  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test....  - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.  - The Swedish Social Democratic Party, (SAP; literally, \\"Social Democratic Workers' Party of Sweden\\"), contesting elections as the \\"ArbetarepartietSocialdemokraterna\\" ('The Workers' Party  The Social Democrats'), usually referred to just as the 'Social Democrats' (\\"Socialdemokraterna\\"); is the oldest and largest political party in Sweden. The current party leader since 2012 is Stefan Löfven; he has also been Prime Minister of Sweden since 2014.  - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age.  - Karl Johan ( K.

How is \\"17.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"In Finnish, the number 17 is said as \\"seitsemäntoista.\\" Finnish, like some other languages, forms numbers by combining words, and in this case, we can break down the word \\"seitsemäntoista\\" into two parts to understand its formation: 1. seitsemän: This translates to the number \\"seven\\" in English. In Finnish, numbers from 0 to 10 have distinct names just like in many other languages. 2. toista: This part comes from the word \\"kymmentä,\\" which means \\"ten\\" in Finnish, combined with the postfix \\"toista\\" that is added to form a number between 11 and 19. In this case, \\"toista\\" means \\"on top of ten\\" or more literally, \\"in the second ten.\\" Putting these two parts together, \\"seitsemäntoista\\" can be understood as \\"seven on top of ten,\\" which translates to the number 17 in English. Finnish belongs to the Uralic language family and has its own unique way of forming and expressing numbers. Just like 17 is \\"seitsemäntoista,\\" other numbers are also formed through unique combinations of words. For example, 21 is \\"kaksikymmentäyksi,\\" which can be translated as \\"two tens and one,\\" and 57 is \\"viisikymmentäseitsemän,\\" which means \\"five tens and seven.\\" This method of forming numbers is consistent throughout the Finnish numeral system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What were much more varied in later periods? , can you please find it?   Chinese imperial tombs are typically  approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied.  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.

Please answer the following question: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. What is the most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trails? - not enough information - to stop eating at night - to attempt to lose weight - to be able to eat more during the day A:","output":"The most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trials was to attempt to lose weight. The study aimed to examine the effects of restricted night time eating on weight loss, and the participants were likely interested in understanding if this strategy could effectively help them shed some extra kilos. The results showed that by reducing their food intake during the evening hours, they indeed consumed fewer kilojoules and lost weight during the period of restricted eating. The idea of eating less food at night time being sensible for someone trying to lose weight is not completely true, as the total amount of food consumed over days and weeks is more crucial for weight gain or weight loss. However, the study highlighted the benefits of eating less at night in reducing the total quantity of food intake and promoting healthier dietary habits. Also, it's worth mentioning that overeating in the evening can often be connected to unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles. Therefore, even though the advice to eat less at night time may not have strong scientific backing in terms of its direct impact on weight loss, it can still effectively help individuals maintain a balanced diet and develop healthier eating patterns that would ultimately contribute to their weight loss journey. In summary, restricting night time food intake can be beneficial for weight loss, not necessarily because of the time at which the food is consumed, but rather because it generally results in a lower overall food consumption. The participants in the study likely joined the trial to explore this approach to weight loss and to see if it would work for them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles.  But I can use this background: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.  What is an answer for this question: In which sample the momentum would not be conserved, sample A or sample B? Answer:","output":"In this situation, we need to determine in which sample, A or B, the momentum would not be conserved. To do this, let's first examine the properties of the samples and then discuss the concept of momentum conservation. Sample A contains gas particles. The background information provided states that particles in a gas are constantly colliding with one another and that one assumption we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. This means that the total momentum and kinetic energy of the colliding particles before the collision are equal to the total momentum and kinetic energy after the collision. In such cases, no energy is lost in other forms, like light or heat. This assumption is important because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, potentially resulting in a condensation of the substance into a solid form. Sample B does not contain gas particles, meaning it could be composed of either liquid or solid particles. In the case of liquids and solids, the collisions between particles are generally considered to be inelastic. This is because the particles are more likely to experience non-conservative forces during the collision, such as friction or deformation, which can transform kinetic energy into other forms. In an inelastic collision, momentum is still conserved; however, kinetic energy is not. Instead, some kinetic energy is lost from the system or converted to other forms, like heat or deformation energy. Now, let's address the question of which sample would exhibit a lack of conservation of momentum, sample A or sample B. According to the principles discussed above, momentum is conserved in both elastic and inelastic collisions. Therefore, both sample A, with gas particles undergoing elastic collisions, and sample B, with either liquid or solid particles undergoing inelastic collisions, would conserve momentum throughout the process. So, in neither sample A nor sample B would the momentum fail to be conserved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Two earth-like planets orbited the same star.  The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes.  Which planet caused more climate change?  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Earth I, where the inhabitants released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, caused more climate change compared to Earth II, which focused on protecting the environment from anthropogenic changes. The release of greenhouse gases contributes to global warming, which causes adverse effects on the planet and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Question: Information:  - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence. It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area.  - Benedetto Ghirlandaio (14581497) was an Italian (Florentine) painter. His brothers Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525) and Domenico Ghirlandaio (14491494) were both painters, as was his nephew Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (14831561). Benedetto died in Florence on 17 July 1497.  - Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475  18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci.  - Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525), also known as David Ghirlandaio and as Davide Bigordi, was an Italian painter and mosaicist, active in his native Florence.   - Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449  11 January 1494) was an Italian Renaissance painter from Florence. Ghirlandaio was part of the so-called \\"third generation\\" of the Florentine Renaissance, along with Verrocchio, the Pollaiolo brothers and Sandro Botticelli. Ghirlandaio was the leader of a large and efficient workshop which included his brothers Davide Ghirlandaio and Benedetto Ghirlandaio, his brother-in-law Bastiano Mainardi from San Gimignano and later his son Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Among the many apprentices that passed through his workshop, the most famous was Michelangelo. Ghirlandaio's particular talent was his ability to depict contemporary life and portraits of contemporary people within the context of religious narratives. This brought him great popularity and many large commissions.  - Giorgio Vasari (30 July 1511  27 June 1574) was an Italian painter, architect, writer, and historian, most famous today for his \\"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\\", considered the ideological foundation of art-historical writing.  - Filippo Brunelleschi (1377  April 15, 1446) was an Italian designer and a key figure in architecture, recognised to be the first modern engineer, planner and sole construction supervisor. He was one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance. He is generally well known for developing a technique for linear perspective in art and for building the dome of the Florence Cathedral. Heavily depending on mirrors and geometry, to \\"reinforce Christian spiritual reality\\", his formulation of linear perspective governed pictorial depiction of space until the late 19th century. It also had the most profound  and quite unanticipated  influence on the rise of modern science. His accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design. His principal surviving works are to be found in Florence, Italy. Unfortunately, his two original linear perspective panels have been lost.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (or Ghirlandajo) (Florence 14 February 1483  6 June 1561) was an Italian Renaissance painter active mainly in Florence. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio was the son of the Italian Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio.  - Lorenzo de' Medici (1 January 1449  9 April 1492) was an Italian statesman and \\"de facto\\" ruler of the Florentine Republic, who was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Renaissance. Also known as Lorenzo the Magnificent (\\"Lorenzo il Magnifico\\" ) by contemporary Florentines, he was a magnate, diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists and poets. He is well known for his contribution to the art world by sponsoring artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. His life coincided with the mature phase of Italian Renaissance and his death coincided with the end of the Golden Age of Florence. The fragile peace that he helped maintain among the various Italian states collapsed with his death. He is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence.  - The Ospedale degli Innocenti ('Hospital of the Innocents', also known in old Tuscan dialect as the Spedale degli Innocenti) is a historical building in Florence, Italy. It was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, who received the commission in 1419 from the Arte della Seta. It was originally a children's orphanage. It is regarded as a notable example of early Italian Renaissance architecture. The hospital, which features a nine bay loggia facing the Piazza SS. Annunziata, was built and managed by the \\"Arte della Seta\\" or Silk Guild of Florence. That guild was one of the wealthiest in the city and, like most guilds, took upon itself philanthropic duties.  - Bastiano Mainardi (1460  1513) was an Italian painter born in San Gimignano.  - Bartolom ( m ) eo di Giovanni , also known as Alunno di Domenico for his relation to his master Domenico Ghirlandaio , was an early Renaissance Italian painter of the Florentine School who was active from about 1488 until his death in 1501 . He studied with and assisted Domenico Ghirlandaio , painting the predella of Ghirlandaio 's Adoration of the Magi in the Ospedale degli Innocenti , the foundling hospital in Florence , in 1488 . Bartolomeo di Giovanni also worked under the guidance of Sandro Botticelli . This painter should not be confused with either the Italian sculptor and architect , Bartolomeo di Giovanni d'Astore Sinibaldi ( 1469 -- 1535 ) , or with the Italian painter and architect , Bartolommeo di Giovanni Corradini ( active mid- 15th century ) .  - Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, known as Sandro Botticelli (c. 1445  May 17, 1510), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. He belonged to the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement that Giorgio Vasari would characterize less than a hundred years later in his \\"Vita\\" of Botticelli as a \\"golden age\\". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.

Kotipelto has been commercially well received in their native Finland, with a Top 10 single \\"Beginning\\" from his first release \\"Waiting for the Dawn\\", and lyrics often concentrating on ancient Egyptian themes.  - Heathenreel is the debut album of Italian folk/power metal band Elvenking.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.  - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Nostradameus was a power metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. They were formed in 1998, and disbanded in 2016. Their latest release is \\"Illusion's Parade\\".  - U.D.O. is a German heavy metal band founded by lead singer Udo Dirkschneider in 1987.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - AFM Records GmbH is a music label based in Schwalmstadt, Germany. They focus on the heavy metal musical genre, signing bands such as U.D.O., Doro, Kotipelto, Masterplan, Nostradameus, and Annihilator.

Input: Paragraph: \\"President Donald Trump and top health officials in his administration are now openly at odds over hydroxychloroquine. Both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House task force, have said careful studies show the drug doesn’t speed recovery from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Still, at an Aug. 3 White House event, Trump said he has taken hydroxychloroquine and it is \\"\\"very highly thought of.\\"\\" Trump said the drug is politically toxic because he supports it. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health and overseer of the virus testing effort, said it is time to \\"\\"move on.\\"\\" \\"\\"There have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to Hydroxychloroquine,\\"\\" Giroir said Aug. 2. \\"\\"So, at this point in time, we don't recommend that as a treatment. \\"\\" We asked Giroir’s office to name the five studies he referenced in that interview. Not all of them used placebos, but they all randomly assigned patients to hydroxychloroquine treatment and conventional treatment groups. The drug proved itself in none of them. Before we summarize the studies, a brief word about why this sort of study matters. If you want to know if a drug works, ideally the only difference between a patient who gets it and one who doesn’t is — no surprise — the drug itself. That’s harder to do than meets the eye. People aren’t identical. You can weigh them, look at their medical histories, check their blood oxygen levels and temperature, and yet, you still might miss something. That’s where randomly assigning patients to treatment and non-treatment groups comes in. \\"\\"You don’t know all the possible things going on in the background and all that noise is what  randomizing helps filter out,\\"\\" said Boston University infectious disease modeler Brooke Nichols. \\"\\"It’s the best way to be sure that the only effect is the effect of the drug.\\"\\" Letting a computer program assign patients also prevents any subconscious choices by doctors from distorting the results. The whole approach is designed to take human foibles out of the picture. To really minimize the human factor, not only do you randomly assign patients to groups, but the patients and the health care workers themselves don’t know what group they are in. So everyone gets a pill, but for half of them, the pill might be just sugar or something equally neutral. That neutral pill is a placebo. \\"\\"That’s the gold-gold standard of research,\\"\\" said Nichols. \\"\\"And just one one small notch below that is the randomized controlled trial without a placebo.\\"\\" Nichols said that the lack of a placebo takes on more importance when a non-placebo study comes up with different results than one with a placebo. \\"\\"When the results are in agreement, it doesn’t matter as much,\\"\\" Nichols said. Giroir’s office sent us a list of the studies he had in mind. All of them used the randomized control approach. Two of them used placebos, and three did not. They all found the drug ineffective. Here’s Giroir’s list (plus a couple more we found ourselves): A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Prevention of Covid-19 Transmission and Disease, MedRxIV, July 26, 2020. No placebo. This study out of Spain aimed to see if the drug prevented the disease. It involved about 2,300 people who had been exposed to someone who tested positive for the virus. After random assignment, one group got a dose of hydroxychloroquine for a week, and the other didn’t. The differences were small, too small to be statistically significant. In the treatment group, 5.7% caught the virus. In the non-treatment group, 6.2% did. \\"\\"Post-exposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection,\\"\\" the authors wrote. Hydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin in Mild-to-Moderate Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, July 23, 2020. No placebo. This study from Brazil assigned 665 patients (504 with testing-confirmed COVID-19) to three groups: standard care, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine alone. \\"\\"Among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care,\\"\\" the authors wrote. Hydroxychloroquine in Nonhospitalized Adults With Early COVID-19, Annals of Internal Medicine, July 16, 2020. Placebo used. This study of 491 patients in the United States and Canada used two groups: one receiving hydroxychloroquine and the other a placebo. Participants either tested positive, or had the symptoms of COVID-19 and lived or worked with someone who had tested positive. They could not have had symptoms for more than four days. \\"\\"We hypothesized that starting hydroxychloroquine therapy within the first few days of symptoms could alter the course of COVID-19 by reducing symptom severity and duration and preventing hospitalizations,\\"\\" the authors wrote. They found that the severity of symptoms after 14 days \\"\\"did not differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups.\\"\\" No clinical benefit from use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, Recovery Trial - University of Oxford, June 5, 2020. No placebo. This study out of the United Kingdom randomly assigned over 4,600 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group and a standard care group. Researchers measured the death rate and symptoms after 28 days. Among the treatment group, 25.7% died, compared to 23.5% for the standard care group. That was not statistically different. And there were no \\"\\"beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes.\\"\\" \\"\\"Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs.,\\"\\" the researchers wrote. The data has yet to be released. A Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19, New England Journal of Medicine, June 3, 2020. Placebo used. This study focused on hydroxychloroquine as a way to avoid getting the disease. They randomly assigned 821 people with no symptoms — but who had spent time close to a person who tested positive — to a treatment or placebo group. The hydroxychloroquine group was slightly less likely to test positive after two weeks, 11.8% compared to 14.3% in the placebo group, but the numbers were too small to pass statistical muster. We found two other randomized controlled studies in addition to those Grigoir referenced. One out of Spain worked with 293 people with confirmed infections, but who were not hospitalized. There was no placebo. They found that hydroxychloroquine did not cut the risk of hospitalization, or help people recover more quickly. An early study in May in Shanghai, China, assigned 75 COVID-19 patients to a hydroxychloroquine treatment group, and another received typical care. It also found no difference in the speed of recovery. There has been one large study in Detroit that concluded that the drug worked. However, patient data in that study was collected after the fact and there was no randomized control process. Giroir said there were five \\"\\"randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine.\\"\\" He is largely correct. There have been more than five randomized controlled trials that found hydroxychloroquine ineffective, either at preventing people from catching the virus, or helping them recover if they become ill. He exaggerated the number of studies that used placebos — out of his list, two did and three did not. The infectious disease modeler we reached said placebos improve the quality of a study, but the lack of one matters less if the results are in line with placebo-driven trials.\\" Claim: “There have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine.” Output:","output":"Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health, claimed that there have been five randomized controlled, placebo controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine. While it is accurate that there have been more than five randomized controlled trials that found hydroxychloroquine ineffective, Giroir's statement slightly exaggerated the number of studies that used placebos. Out of his list, two trials used placebos and three did not. These trials focused on either preventing people from catching the virus, or helping them recover if they became ill. Despite the discrepancy in the number of placebo trials, the results were consistent in finding hydroxychloroquine ineffective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: After almost 30 years of arguing that a black hole swallows up everything that falls into it, British astrophysicist   Stephen Hawking moved backward last week. The world-famous writer of \\"Brief History of Time\\" said he and other scientists had got it wrong. \\"I've been thinking about this problem for the last 30 years, and I think I now have the answer to it,\\" said Hawking. \\"A black hole only appears to form but later opens up and set free information about what fell inside. So we can be sure of the past and can predict the future.\\" The findings could help solve the \\"black hole information paradox \\", an important puzzle in modern physics. A black hole is an area in space where matter is under such pressure that even light can not escape from its gravitational pull . But, exactly what happens there has long puzzled scientists. Black holes occur when a powerful star burns up its nuclear fuel and gravity forces it to break down in on itself. The great weight of the star's outer layers moves in towards its center. The force of gravity keeps nearly all light from escaping and nothing inside can be seen from the outside. The star actually disappears from the universe into a point of infinite density . That is a place where the laws of general relativity that govern space and time break down. Hawking has devoted most of his life to studying these questions. At the beginning,  _ believed the holes were like a \\"universal vacuum   cleaner\\", sucking up everything in their path. Hawking revolutionized the study of black holes when he proved, in 1976 that, under the strange rules of quantum physics , when black holes form they send out energy and lose mass in the process. In thinking up this so-called \\"Hawking radiation\\", the prefix = st1 /Cambridgemathematician also created one of the biggest puzzles in physics. These particles  , he said, contained no information about what has been occurring inside the black hole, or how it formed. Under his theory, once the black hole disappears, all the information within it is lost.   Answer: They could help solve the puzzle about black holes. A:","output":"Part #1: British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking changed his viewpoint on black holes. Usage: Hawking revised his opinion that black holes swallow up everything that falls into them. He spent 30 years researching this topic and concluded that black holes can actually release information about what fell inside them. Part #2: A black hole only appears to form but later opens up and sets free information about what fell inside. Usage: A black hole was believed to trap and swallow everything, but Hawking discovered that it can reveal information about the trapped objects, enabling scientists to predict the past and the future based on the contents. Part #3: The importance of the puzzle in modern physics. Usage: The answer to the black hole information paradox helps advance our understanding of physics, especially regarding black hole formation and behavior. Part #4: Black holes are created when a massive star burns up its nuclear fuel and collapses. Usage: A black hole is formed when a star's outer layers move in towards its center under immense pressure, causing it to disappear from the universe into a point of infinite density. Part #5: Hawking's theory on black holes, known as \\"Hawking radiation.\\" Usage: In 1976, Hawking proved that black holes emit energy and lose mass while forming, creating a major puzzle in physics when he found that particles emitted from black holes held no information about their contents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This Act may be cited as the \`\`Federal Consent Decree Fairness  Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress finds that:             (1) Consent decrees are for remedying violations of rights,          and they should not be used to advance any policy extraneous to          the protection of those rights.             (2) Consent decrees are also for protecting the party who          faces injury and should not be expanded to apply to parties not          involved in the litigation.             (3) In structuring consent decrees, courts should take into          account the interests of State and local governments in          managing their own affairs.             (4) Consent decrees should be structured to give due          deference to the policy judgments of State and local officials          as to how to obey the law.             (5) Whenever possible, courts should not impose consent          decrees that require technically complex and evolving policy          choices, especially in the absence of judicially discoverable          and manageable standards.             (6) Consent decrees should not be unlimited, but should          contain an explicit and realistic strategy for ending court          supervision. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CONSENT DECREES.     (a) In General.--Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is  amended by adding at the end the following: \`\`Sec.  1660.

The key provisions of the Act are: 1. Consent decrees must only be used to remedy violations of rights and not to advance unrelated policies. 2. Consent decrees should protect injured parties and not extend to others uninvolved in the litigation. 3. Courts should consider the interests of State and local governments in managing their own affairs when structuring decrees. 4. Consent decrees should respect the policy judgments of State and local officials on how to obey the law. 5. Courts should avoid imposing decrees that require complex and constantly changing policy decisions. 6. Consent decrees should have a clear and realistic strategy for ending court supervision. The Act states that a State or local government or official can file a motion to modify or vacate a consent decree after four years from its implementation or after the term of the highest elected official who consented to the decree. The party that filed the original civil action must then prove that the continued enforcement of the decree is necessary to uphold a federal right.

The Mom of Betty has passed away, but Katrina's is still living, so","output":"Katrina's mother has naturally taken on a more significant role in both of their lives. As the two friends navigate through the various stages of grief and acceptance, they find comfort and solace in their shared experiences and the warmth that Katrina's mother provides. Over time, Katrina's mother comes to consider Betty as her own daughter, showering her with the same love and affection that she had reserved for Katrina. For Betty, having lost her own mother, this new bond brings a sense of belonging that had been missing in her life. Meanwhile, for Katrina, seeing her mother extend such kindness towards her friend fills her heart with immense gratitude and strengthens their friendship even more. Apart from the emotional support that Katrina's mother offers, she also lends a helping hand in practical matters. From accompanying the girls to school events and shopping for essentials, to guiding them through important life decisions, she becomes a steadfast presence in their lives. In many ways, this nurturing figure plays an essential role in helping Betty overcome the immense void left by her mother's demise. As the years pass, the bond between the three of them only grows stronger. They share countless memories together, from celebrating graduations and birthdays, to comforting each other in times of heartbreak. It is evident that the love between Katrina, Betty, and Katrina's mother transcends the boundaries of blood relations, and has instead bloomed into a beautiful, chosen family. With the passage of time, both Betty and Katrina grow into confident and compassionate young women, their paths uniquely shaped by the nurturing presence of Katrina's mother. Even as they pursue their individual dreams and ambitions, they never lose sight of the love and support that has been their constant anchor, always coming back to one another and to the mother figure who unconditionally tied them together. Eventually, the day comes when Katrina's mother grows old and frail, and it is now Betty and Katrina's turn to take on the responsibility of caring for her. United by their love and gratitude, the two friends tirelessly look after their beloved mother figure, who graciously accepts their support, just as she had given them in their time of need. And through the inevitable heartaches and challenges that come with life, the unbreakable bond between Betty, Katrina, and Katrina's mother endures, a testament to the transcendent power of friendship, love, and the families we create for ourselves.

Article:It is the biggest game in English football and a massive occasion for his first United appearance - if he features at Old Trafford. But the very fact I am wondering whether Martial will start, or even play at all, says a lot about the £36m transfer and suggests that United have paid such a massive initial fee for his potential, rather than anything he has done in his career so far. Martial is 19, and before the start of this season had only completed four first-team games for Monaco. He has played a total of 30 minutes of senior international football for France, all in the past week. Like myself, not many United fans will have seen much of him in action but, starting this weekend, he is going to be under major scrutiny because of how much he has cost, his record up to this point and the fact a club of their size has signed him. The pressure will be immense. So I hope that he proves to be the absolute gem of a player that United think they have bought, for his own sake and for the sake of English football too. Media playback is not supported on this device Otherwise, United spending so much on a teenager who has scored only 11 goals in 52 matches in Ligue 1 will just be used to show how the money in our game has gone completely crazy. At the moment, that is what most people seem to be thinking. His fee could rise to £58m and every single former player I have spoken to has been amazed by how much he has cost considering how little football he has played. On paper, what he has done is not that impressive either. If Martial had scored 25-30 goals I would be thinking 'that's only in Ligue 1' and he has not even got close to that. His goalscoring record does not say to me that he is going to be the new Sergio Aguero, but I am hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I am not on my own in not knowing what to expect from him, let alone where he will play, but being a bit of an unknown quantity will help him against Liverpool. So far, Martial has said all the right things in interviews and, considering he has joined one of the biggest clubs in the world, he seems to be dealing with everything pretty well. It is on the pitch where he will be judged, though, and it could be that this weekend he goes 'bang' - with a performance that shouts \\"here I am, and this is what I can do\\". That could happen, especially in a team like United's. They will create chances and, if Martial has got the strength and pace I keep hearing about, then he could have a big impact very quickly. I hope he does, because it would be great for the Premier League to have a new star. The best scenario, especially for a forward player, is obviously that he hits the ground running at his new club by scoring some goals straightaway. There was pressure on me when I joined Arsenal for what was then a club record fee of £2.5m in September 1991 but I scored in my first game, got a hat-trick in my second and never looked back. Any pressure disappeared and, instead, I was full of confidence. The way I looked at it then was that I could go four games without scoring and my average would still be good but the way I was feeling, I knew more goals would come - and they did. Not every player gets off to a flying start like I did at Arsenal. Also for the Gunners, Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp both had to wait a while to get off the mark. I have heard Martial being compared to Henry a lot because of his playing style and the way he can come off the left or right wing as well as down the middle. That is great if it is true and, if he is not an out-and-out striker, he will need to be able to make goals for others like Henry could. Yes, those comparisons add even more pressure but they are inevitable because both players left Monaco at a young age and came to England for big money - Henry had a brief spell at Juventus in between, but his £10.5m fee was the third-biggest in English football when he came to Highbury in 1999. Henry, who was a couple of years older than Martial and a lot more experienced at first-team level, scored 26 goals in his first season for Arsenal, but did not find the net until his ninth game for the club. There is an argument that Henry's early days are an example of why Martial will need time before showing us what he can do. That is true, but I still saw Henry's ability in those first few games. I had left Arsenal by then but on his left foot or right foot, he had skill and athleticism and was such a dynamic player. He was not scoring goals but I remember looking at him and thinking 'wow - when he kicks in, he is going to be awesome'. In Memphis Depay, United already have one young player who makes me think the same whenever I watch him. You can see Memphis is not quite firing on all cylinders at the moment but there is still something really explosive building up in him, and you can tell he is going to do something special soon. What I saw from Thierry and what we are seeing now from Memphis is what I want from Martial on Saturday. It would be even better if he can nick a goal or two as well. One thing that Martial can rely on at his new club is that his team-mates will look after him and help him as much as they can, especially because of his age, his price tag and the fact he has moved to a different country. Even a player of Bergkamp's experience needed that while he settled in. He went six games without scoring after joining Arsenal for a British record fee of £7.5m in 1995, but we were unbeaten during that time and I scored four goals, which took a lot of the pressure off him. Media playback is not supported on this device You can be sure that Wayne Rooney will look to do the same for Martial and I think it is brilliant news for United that he has just broken Sir Bobby Charlton's record as England's top goalscorer. Rooney has had a difficult start to the Premier League season but his international goals in the past week will have lifted a weight off his shoulders and, whether Martial plays or not, I think Liverpool could feel the backlash of that at the weekend. Ian Wright was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The article discusses the potential of Anthony Martial, a 19-year-old football player who recently joined Manchester United for a massive £36m transfer fee. Despite only having played a total of 30 minutes of senior international football for France, many are excited for his debut and wonder if he will live up to the high expectations set by the price tag. The pressure is immense, and the coming weeks will likely reveal whether Martial proves to be an exceptional talent, helping to shape the future of English football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Watling Street is the name given to an ancient trackway in England and Wales that was first used by the Britons mainly between the areas of modern Canterbury and using a natural ford near Westminster. The Romans later paved the route, which then connected the Kentish ports of Dubris (Dover), Rutupiae (Richborough), Lemanis (Lympne), and Regulbium (Reculver) to their bridge over the Thames at Londinium (London). The continuation northwest passed Verulamium (St Albans) on its way to Viroconium (Wroxeter). The Romans considered the continuation on to Blatobulgium (Birrens) beyond Hadrian's Wall to be part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg. Watling Street was the site of Boudica's defeat by the Romans and the southwestern border of the Danelaw. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the sea was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road. Today, the route from Dover to London forms part of the A2 road and the route from London to Wroxeter forms much of the A5 road.  - Loughborough (or ) is a town within the Charnwood borough of Leicestershire, England.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Hardy was born in Cameron, North Carolina, the son of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy. He is the older brother of Jeff Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986. Hardy played baseball as a child and throughout high school, but had stopped by his senior year. Shortly after the departure of Matt and Jeff from TNA was made public, Matt's wife, Reby, went on a social media tirade in which she repeatedly slammed TNA, the company's new management and the way in which contract negotiations between the company and the Hardy family were conducted. A few weeks following this, the bad blood between the two sides intensified, so much so that the new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay-per-view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.  Newly-appointed Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Broken gimmick to Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana and Billy Corgan, and while Borash specifically had the most input into the gimmick of the three aside from Matt, the Hardy family deny that Borash was the sole person behind the gimmick. In November 2017, Impact Wrestling changed their policy, allowing all talent to retain complete ownership over their intellectual property, essentially forfeiting ownership of the \\"Broken\\" character to Hardy.  On January 31, 2018, the legal battle officially concluded when Matt legally acquired ownership of all trademarks related to the Broken universe and the Broken gimmick, which includes 'Broken Matt', 'Brother Nero', 'Broken Brilliance' and 'Vanguard1'. Matt is now able to use the Broken gimmick as he sees fit, regardless of the promotion he competes in with the one caveat being that the promotion green-lights the use of the gimmick in that promotion, which includes major domestic U.S. promotions such as WWE or ROH. Who else claims to own the broken gimmick?","output":"\\"Newly-appointed Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Broken gimmick to Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana and Billy Corgan.\\" This quote suggests that aside from the Hardy family, Ed Nordholm of Impact Wrestling and the mentioned individuals - Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana, and Billy Corgan - have also claimed to have ownership over the Broken gimmick."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The post office was located in one corner and the telephone booth in another, and this latter institution was regarded with much awe by the simple natives. Once in awhile some one would telephone over to the Junction on some trivial business, but the long-distance call was never employed except by the \\"nabobs\\"--the local name for John Merrick and his nieces--or by the manager of the new mill at Royal, who had extended the line to his own office in the heart of the pine forest.  So, when Uncle John and the girls entered Cotting's store and the little gentleman shut himself up in the telephone booth, a ripple of excitement spread throughout the neighborhood. Skim Clark, the youthful hope of the Widow Clark, who \\"run the Emporium,\\" happened to be in the store and he rushed out to spread the news that \\"the nabob's talkin' to New Yoruk!\\"  This information demanded immediate attention. Marshall McMahon McNutt, familiarly known as \\"Peggy\\" McNutt--because he had once lost a foot in a mowing machine--and who was alleged to be a real estate agent, horse doctor, fancy poultry breeder and palmist, and who also dabbled in the sale of subscription books, life insurance, liniment and watermelons, quickly slid off his front porch across the way and sauntered into Cotting's to participate in the excitement. Seth Davis, the blacksmith, dropped his tools and hurried to the store, and the druggist three doors away--a dapper gentleman known as Nib Corkins--hurriedly locked his door and attended the meeting. Presently the curious group was enlarged by the addition of Nick Thome the liveryman, Lon Taft, a carpenter and general man-of-all-work, and Silas Caldwell the miller, the latter a serious individual who had \\"jest happened to come acrost from the mill in the nick o' time.\\"  Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. who used long-distance calls? 2. what was the name of the town? 3. what was nabob the local name for? 4. whose store was more popular, Sam's or Bob's? 5. was it a specific store or a general store? 6. what did people like to do there? 7. who went in the telephone booth? 8. did it cause excitement? 9. whose nickname was Peggy? 10. who was Widow Clark related to? 11. were they the one who talked about the phone call? 12. how many professions was Peggy alleged to have? 13. what chopped off his foot? 14. what was Nick Thome's job? 15. was Peggy excited? 16. where did he go to participate? 17. did Seth Davis also go? 18. what were they doing?","output":"1.

Please answer the following question: Answer the question below:   Jimbo heated a pot of water on his stove. What happens to the amount of oxygen contained in the water as the temperature increases increases or decreases?    Assuming that:  Warm water cant hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water, so an increase in the temperature of water decreases the amount of oxygen it contains. Answer:","output":"As the temperature of the water increases, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases. Step 1: Jimbo heats a pot of water on his stove, which causes the water temperature to rise. Rationale: Heating the pot increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules, causing an increase in temperature. Step 2: As the water temperature increases, its ability to hold dissolved oxygen decreases, in accordance with the given assumption. Rationale: The solubility of oxygen in water decreases with an increase in temperature. This is because the increased kinetic energy of the water molecules makes it more difficult for them to maintain bonds with oxygen molecules.  Step 3: Since the water's ability to hold dissolved oxygen decreases as temperature increases, the amount of oxygen contained in the water will decrease. Rationale: As the water loses its ability to hold oxygen, the dissolved oxygen will leave the water, either by being released into the atmosphere or used up by aerobic organisms in the water, which further lowers the remaining oxygen concentration in the water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy. Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine, who has run away from the palace, unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love, but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended, tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated.

Anis Mohamed Youssef Ferchichi (born 28 September 1978), better known as Bushido, is a German rapper, producer and entrepreneur in real estate industry. The word \\"bushido\\" is Japanese and means \\"Way of the Warrior\\". He also uses the pseudonym Sonny Black, based on Dominic Napolitano. In 2004, he and fellow rapper D- Bushido provoked much discussion through his use of controversial song lyrics, which can be interpreted as being misogynistic, homophobic, sexist and violence-glorifying. For example, the song \\"Nutte Bounce\\", from his demo album King of KingZ (2001), frequently uses the term \\"Nutte\\" (German for prostitute or \\"bitch\\"). When questioned, Bushido explained that he doesn't mean women in general but rather the \\"real bitches\\". The song \\"Berlin\\" from his debut Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline (2003) has the following line, which can be interpreted as homophobic:  In November 2005, Bushido hit the headlines after he made a scornful remark about Paris Hilton in an interview with net.zeitung.de: \\"She is just a stupid piece of meat... I would like to have her for the sexual act: humiliating and then bye.\\"  On ersguterjunge Sampler Vol. 2 - Vendetta (2006) he made a reference to Natascha Kampusch on the song \\"Eine Nummer fur sich\\", which has been criticized as \\"crude\\". Quoted as following:  In late August 2007, it also caused a lot criticism against Bushido's involvement on the concert Schau nicht weg, a campaign against violence at schools, organized by Bravo and VIVA. The critics argue that Bushido could not count as a role model because of his \\"homophobic and anti-women lyrics\\". But since 2006 he was, according to Bravo, very involved in the project, so his live performance could not be canceled. During the performance, Bushido appealed in an aggressive manner to a small group of homosexual protesters by saying: \\"You fuckers can demonstrate, hang yourself - I don't give a shit\\". This led to more criticism and controversy.  In June 2009, after participants of the Kreuzberg Pride spotted Bushido on the Berlin U-Bahn Schlesisches Tor, a verbal conflict ensued between the rapper and the participants in which Bushido insulted individuals by referring to their sexual orientation. As result, he and his entourage were splashed with drinks and the organizers of the pride sued him for libel.

In some societies, the slave trade destabilized the region and lead to political unrest as individuals and communities fought with each other to capture slaves to sell to the Europeans. It also devastated the economy in certain regions of Africa as millions of people were uprooted and exported, leaving a gap in the workforce causing economic decline due to the lack of labor for agriculture and other work. Moreover, it inhibited the establishment of broader economic linkages internally and with other parts of the world, as it redirected energies towards slave hunting and keeping rather than state-building or productive activities.

Question: -  The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is that the isotope is unstable. An unstable isotope, also known as a radioactive isotope or radioisotope, has an imbalance of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, causing it to be unstable. This instability leads to the emission of radiation as the isotope attempts to stabilize itself by undergoing radioactive decay. During this decay process, the isotope loses some atomic particles, transforming into a different element. Eventually, the isotope reaches a stable state, at which point it is finished decaying and emitting radiation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After grinding the ore, froth flotation, which selectively separates minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity, is used to get an ore concentrate. This concentrate consists of about 50% zinc with the rest being sulfur (32%), iron (13%), and SiO 2 (5%). The composition of this is normally zinc sulfide (80% to 85%), iron sulfide (7.0% to 12%), lead sulfide (3.0% to 5.0%) silica (2.5% to 3.5%), and cadmium sulfide (0.35% to 0.41%).

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A physical change involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can behomogeneous (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. Compounds can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but elements cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe physical properties without changing the composition of the substance, whereas chemical propertiesdescribe the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical changes (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. Intensive properties are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points. Extensive properties depend on the amount of material and include mass and volume. The ratio of two extensive properties, mass and volume, is an important intensive property called density.   Q: What term describes anything that occupies space and has mass, and is generally divided into three states?

You can use a funnel to help pour hot liquid into a jar. Using a funnel is the correct option because it helps direct the flow of liquid into the jar, minimizing spills and splashes. A funnel has a wide top that narrows towards the bottom, allowing you to pour hot liquid into it easily, and the narrow bottom channels the liquid into the jar. Using a colander [1] is not suitable for pouring hot liquid into a jar because it is designed to strain and drain liquids from larger solid materials like pasta or vegetables. The holes in the colander would allow the liquid to escape, making it ineffective for this task."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Vince Gallo needs to lighten up and have his friends pitch in and buy him some film classes, or at least some classic movies on DVD.If I want to see a film shot almost entirely from the interior of a moving car looking through the windshield, I'll watch my own home movies from my last vacation. In fact, I may enter my home movies at the next Cannes Film Festival and see if I win any awards.Only redeeming scene is where Chloe Sevigney goes pole diving on Vincent Gallo, but like another viewer correctly suggests, the movie is not worth dying through for this one scene, so download it from a website instead. The DVD is suitable as a drink coaster or mini-frisbee. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer uses terms such as \\"god-awful, pretentious, self-indulgent, and soporific nonsense\\" to describe the film. Additionally, they suggest that the director should take film classes or watch classic movies to improve their skills. The reviewer also makes a comparison to their own home movies and jokes about submitting them to a film festival. The only redeeming aspect mentioned involves a single scene, which the reviewer recommends downloading instead of watching the entire film. Lastly, the reviewer comments that the DVD is suitable for use as a drink coaster or mini-frisbee, further emphasizing their negative view of the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process:  - Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract - Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion.  suppose less body movement occurs happens, how will it affect muscles contracting MORE INTENSELY.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation of less body movement causing muscles to contract more intensely would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Justification of steps: 1. Less body movement occurs, which means muscles are not used as much, leading to a potential decrease in their overall activity. 2. With reduced muscle activity, the muscles will tend to adapt to this lower level of usage, possibly leading to atrophy or muscle weakening. The body tries to conserve energy and resources when it senses muscles are not being used as frequently or intensively. 3. When infrequent or intense muscle contractions happen, the muscles have not been regularly trained for such activity, so they may contract more intensely in an effort to compensate for the reduced activity and effectiveness of the muscle fibers. 4. While the physiological process of muscle contraction (electrical signals, filaments, and opposing muscle pairs) remains the same, the intensity of the contractions seems to be influenced indirectly by the overall decrease in body movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
