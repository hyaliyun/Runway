He called himself an architect. But the buildings he designed were works of art. He looked at the ugly square buildings around him, and he did not like what he saw. He wondered why people built ugly homes, when they could have beautiful ones.     Frank Lloyd Wright lived from 1869 to 1959. When he was young, there were no courses in architecture, so he went to work in an architect's office in order to learn how to design buildings. Soon he was designing buildings that were beautiful.     He also wanted to make his buildings fit into the land around them. One of the houses he designed is on top of a high hill. Other people built tall, square houses on hills, but Wright did not want to lose the beauty of the hill. He built the house low and wide.     Now other architects know how to design buildings to fit into the land. Frank Lloyd Wright showed them how to do it. Frank Lloyd Wright has been called an artist because   _  .

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes. Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina.

Q:Given the following passage  \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Here is an article: The authorities identified the slain trooper as David C. Brinkerhoff, 29, a member of the agency’s mobile response team. Trooper Brinkerhoff and another member of the assault team, Richard G. Mattson, went into the farmhouse, about 110 miles northwest of New York City, to help other troopers who were responding to a burglar alarm about 8 a.m. Wednesday. They were looking for Mr. Trim, who was suspected of shooting another trooper, Matthew Gombosi, the previous day. The authorities said Mr. Trim then shot Trooper Brinkerhoff in the head, and Trooper Mattson in the left arm. They were both taken by helicopter to Albany Medical Center. On learning of the slaying of the trooper, the second member of the mobile response team to be killed in a manhunt since September, Gov. Eliot Spitzer canceled a planned lunchtime speech in Manhattan, asking his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, to fill in for him. He returned to Albany and in a brief statement issued by his office, he said, “One of our best has fallen and another has been seriously wounded in the line of duty.” In the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats were moving swiftly, but in different directions, in response both to the trooper shootings as well as the shootings at Virginia Tech last week. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called on the governor to pressure the Democratic-led Assembly to pass legislation that would bring back the death penalty for those who kill law enforcement officers, as well as terrorists. The governor has supported both ideas in the past, but a similar bill was voted down in the Assembly on Tuesday, 96 to 47. “I’m asking the governor to use his considerable influence with the Assembly,” Mr. Bruno said. Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican whose district includes Margaretville, said of the governor: “I know you’re a law and order guy, I know you are, I know you care about the safety of our families. Get the Assembly to do what they must do.” But Charles Carrier, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, reiterated that Assembly Democrats oppose the death penalty. Instead, the Assembly passed a number of antigun measures on Wednesday, including bills banning assault weapons and armor-piercing ammunition. The events that led to the shooting of the three officers began last Friday, when Mr. Trim, of North Lawrence, near the Canadian border, was said to have stolen a van. On Tuesday afternoon in Margaretville, 270 miles south of where the van was taken, Trooper Gombosi pulled Mr. Trim over because the van was missing a license plate, Mr. Felton, the acting superintendent, said. When Mr. Trim failed to provide identification, Trooper Gombosi told him he was under arrest. At that point, Mr. Trim pulled a handgun from his waistband and fired once at the trooper, Mr. Felton said. The trooper was hit in the lower ribs, but the police said his body armor saved him from serious injury. “He was disoriented and he could not produce any identification,” Mr. Felton said of Mr. Trim. One investigator said that Mr. Trim was looking at a map when he was pulled over, as if he were lost. The police later found the abandoned van a few miles from where the confrontation with Trooper Gombosi took place. By Tuesday night, the authorities said troopers had converged on the rural area — stopping cars and trucks and using police dogs — in search of Mr. Trim. On Wednesday morning, the burglar alarm drew them to the farmhouse, where they found a backpack, clothing and identification. A short time later, the authorities said, the troopers exchanged gunfire with Mr. Trim, and Troopers Brinkerhoff and Matson were shot. Before long, scores of heavily armed troopers surrounded the farmhouse where Mr. Trim was believed to be hiding. Armored vehicles moved in, snipers took position behind stone walls, and other officers spread across the roads and hilltops overlooking the house. At one point, troopers shot tear-gas canisters inside the home, eliciting no response. Then, a robot with a camera rolled in, and scanned the house for the suspect. Late in the afternoon, troopers began moving in and once again fired tear gas canisters. The house erupted in flames, driving back the officers. “It’s unbelievable,” said Anna Carli, a retired nurse who has lived in Margaretville for 40 years. “This is a little town. This kind of thing doesn’t happen here.” In the section of Coxsackie, just outside Albany, where Trooper Brinkerhoff — an eight-year veteran of the State Police — lived with his wife, Barbara, and their 7-month-old daughter, the police kept the press and the curious away. The events on Wednesday reminded many of the five-month manhunt last year for Ralph J. Phillips, during which three troopers were shot, one fatally. The hunt began after Mr. Phillips escaped from the Erie County jail on April 2, 2006. On Wednesday, outside Albany Medical Center, where he had met with relatives of Trooper Mattson’s, the Rev. James LeFebvre, chaplain of the Albany Police Department, described his reaction when he heard the news of Trooper Brinkerhoff’s death: “You say, ‘Give me the good news.’ And they say, ‘There isn’t any good news,’ and you say, ‘No, not again.’ ” Lisa W. Foderaro reported from Margaretville and Fernanda Santos from White Plains. Reporting was contributed by Nick Confessore in Coxsackie, Laura Drake in North Lawrence, Danny Hakim in Albany and Jennifer Medina in New York City.

Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or \\"Red Eye\\" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses.

WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Sentence 1: See it and you still won't believe it. Sentence 2: You will not want to believe what you see.   Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Analyze both sentences to understand their meaning. Sentence 1: \\"See it and you still won't believe it.\\" This sentence implies that even if the user sees something, they still won't believe its authenticity or existence. Something is so unbelievable that experiencing it visually doesn't make its existence believable. Sentence 2: \\"You will not want to believe what you see.\\" This sentence implies that the user sees something and doesn't want to believe it. It could mean the visual experience might be shocking, overwhelming, or surreal. Step 2: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. Entailment means that if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 must also be true. To determine this, we will analyze if the truth of Sentence 1 requires the truth of Sentence 2. In both sentences, the theme is about believing or not believing something seen. However, they differ in their focus: - Sentence 1 focuses on the inability to believe something even when the user sees it. - Sentence 2 focuses on the user's desire to not believe what they see. Thus, while both sentences convey disbelief to some extent, they are not necessarily causally linked or dependent on each other. It's possible for someone to see something unbelievable yet still want to believe it (in which case, Sentence 2 would not be true). Conclusion: The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences share the theme of disbelief, they address different aspects (inability vs. desire not to believe), and the truth of one sentence does not guarantee the truth of the other."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool.

I read this background article the other day: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  I am facing a new situation today: Two teams of researchers studied the environment in Antarctica. Team Black studied air pollution and the ozone layer, Team Red studied the water.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which team observed higher levels of UV reaching Earth?

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: What is most likely the author's occupation? Answer: Answer:","output":"The author is most likely a healthcare professional, possibly a doctor or a medical expert, specializing in blood pressure management for older adults. This is evident from their knowledge of blood pressure guidelines, familiarity with medical studies, and their statement about not changing their clinical practice based on new guidelines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes. What Celenda grabbed from the bowl? - not enough information - four petals - five petals - ten petals A:","output":"Celenda grabbed ten petals of the captivating red lotus from the bronze bowl, one more than she usually indulged in. Her worries about the crumbling villa, torn furniture, and diminishing coffers disappeared as soon as she inhaled the rich, intoxicating scent of the leaves. The vibrant warmth radiating from the braziers crept into her veins, and the sounds and sights of her guests and the decadent feast enhanced the intense euphoria flooding her senses. As she placed the petals to her lips, the slave boy watched her every move, knowing how valuable those petals were and how scarce they were becoming. Hints of unease lingered in the air; the uninterrupted days of boundless merriment were a fading memory. However, in that moment, the reality of her predicament was as elusive as the waning wisps of the red lotus petals' fragrance. With each petal, the intoxicating influence surged through her body, triggering intense sensations. Her thoughts soon dissolved into blissful oblivion, if only for a short while. The guests, indulging in the sensory whirlwind of their mistress, became intoxicated by the thinning resources, each thoroughly intent on their own sensual fixations. Conversations roar louder as the addictive haze propels the guests deeper into their fervent state. Laughter abounds, secrets are shared, and indiscreet sighs emerge from behind crimson-draped hovels. But as the night wears on, the feast begins to wane, and the dwindling supply of red lotus petals becomes strikingly apparent. The sound of boisterous laughter and the clinking of goblets fade, making way for the ominous reality that the days of never-ending opulence are well and truly numbered. Whispers regarding the past seamstress are replaced with speculations involving the fading glory and diminishing fortune of their once-magnificent host. While the guests' urgency to revel in the fleeting moments of grandeur subsists, concern over the scarcity of the red lotus blooms like a malignant growth that cannot be excised. In the deepest and most vulnerable parts of their minds, they anxiously wonder how long they can cling to the increasingly tattered vestiges of the lavish warmth they had grown accustomed to, as their world crumbles around them. Celenda, a vision of hedonistic vulnerability, slowly regains her senses. The sheer weight of her predicament creeps back into her consciousness. As she reclines on her now worn-out silk divan, fingertips tracing the frays and flaws in the fabric, she grudgingly faces the most harrowing truth: in her quest for endless bliss and momentary abandonment, she had inadvertently set the stage for the inevitable downfall of her once-great empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Harry Partch (June 24, 1901 - September 3, 1974) was an American composer, music theorist, and creator of musical instruments. He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales. He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947). Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave. Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music. Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments.  In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and did recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949-1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings. In spring 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation.  In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949-1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953.  After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962. Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California.","output":"This text is about Harry Partch, an American composer, music theorist, and creator of musical instruments.

(CNN) -- North Korea twice came back from behind to hold Greece 2-2 in a friendly between two sides heading to the World Cup next month, while fellow finalists Paraguay lost 2-1 to the Republic of Ireland.  In a match played at a neutral venue in Altach, Austria, Costas Katsouranis gave Greece the lead in the second minute with a close-range finish.  The Koreans leveled when Jong Tae-se beat two players and fired a shot past goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis.  Angelos Charisteas came off the bench to put the Greeks 2-1 in front shortly after half-time but, three minutes later, Jong raced down the right flank, cut inside and slammed home his second.  Greece substitute goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas had to be at his sharpest to keep out a powerful shot from Cha Jong-hyok that could have won the game for the Asian side.  In Dublin, first-half goals from Kevin Doyle and Liam Lawrence helped Ireland to victory over the South Americans.  Wolves striker Doyle bundled the opener after Paraguay forward Roque Santa Cruz had headed against his own bar.  Lawrence smashed home the second in the 39th minute following a chest down from Doyle.  Lucas Barrios pulled a goal back on his Paraguay debut but Giovanni Trapattoni's men held on for victory.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast.

In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos has also brought this attention to detail as a producer and writer in several successful TV series, further cementing his position as a notable crime writer with a keen eye for authenticity. In Pelecanos' latest work, \\"The Cut,\\" we also see this attention to detail through the introduction of Spero Lucas, an Iraq war veteran and private investigator. The novel immerses readers in the morally gray and often violent world Lucas inhabits. Pelecanos demonstrates this skill in capturing the authentic urban experience and detailing the struggles faced by his characters, such as working-class families and tense racial and ethnic relations, which is why he is considered one of the greatest living American crime writers."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Mr. Black was the manager of a hotel in Atlanta. One weekend all of the hotels were full because of a large business meeting being held in the city. On Sunday night, three men came into Mr. Black's hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Black told them that there were no more rooms available. The men didn't know what to do because they had no place to stay in. Mr. Black wanted to help them. He remembered that there was an empty room at the far end of the first floor -- Room 112. It was a very small room, and had rarely been used as a guest room before. So, he asked the three men if they would mind sharing that small room. They replied that they would be very satisfied so long as there was a room for them to stay in for the night. Mr. Black then told them that the room would cost them  30 in total. On hearing this, each of the three men gave Mr. Black  10 before they left for their room. However, Mr. Black soon began to think that  30 was really too much for that small room. He called his assistant over and said, \\"Here is  5. Give it back to the three men in Room 112. Each of them paid me 10. That's too much.\\" The assistant took the money. While he was on the way to that small room, he thought, \\"How can three men divide  5?  I'll give each of them only  1 and keep the  2 left to myself. The men will be happy to get anything back, and I can also make some money that way. After all, Mr. Black will never know anything about it.\\" So, the assistant returned only 1 to each of the three men. Each man had first paid  10. After the assistant returned 1 to him, each man had actually paid only  9. There were three men.  9x3=\\"27.\\" The assistant kept  2.  27 +  2=\\" \\" 29. Where is the missing dollar? Question: Why didn't Mr. Black offer Room 112 to the three men at first? - The key had been lost. - It was too small for three men. - No one had stayed there before. - It was not bright enough.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - earth - multivitamin - mineral - ore - dietary concerns The answer is:","output":"ore Before getting the refined mineral, you begin with collecting and mining the ore. To provide a detailed understanding of the process, let's break down the steps involved in obtaining refined minerals from ores. 1. Exploration: The first step is to locate and discover mineral deposits. This process involves numerous techniques such as geological mapping, remote sensing, and geophysical surveys to identify areas with high concentrations of valuable minerals. 2. Extraction: Once a mineral deposit is identified, mining companies establish mines to extract the ore. There are different methods of extraction, including surface mining (open-pit or strip mining) and underground mining (shaft or tunnel mining). The choice of method depends on what type of deposit is being targeted and various other factors such as depth, location, and environmental impact. 3. Crushing and grinding: After extraction, the ore is transported to a processing facility, where it undergoes crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the rock. This enables the separation of valuable minerals from the waste rock (also called gangue) and prepares the material for further processing. 4. Beneficiation: Following the size reduction process, beneficiation techniques are employed to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock. Common methods include flotation, magnetic separation, and gravity concentration. These processes increase the concentration of valuable minerals in the ore and result in an enriched material called concentrate. 5. Smelting and refining: The concentrate is subjected to various smelting and refining processes to extract the desired mineral. In the case of metals, these processes generally involve heating the concentrate in furnaces to separate the metal from the impurities. This results in the production of a molten metal, which can then be cast into various shapes or forms, such as ingots or bars. 6. Environmental management and rehabilitation: Throughout the mining and refining process, environmental considerations must be addressed to minimize negative impacts on the surrounding areas. This involves proper waste management, air and water pollution control, and site rehabilitation. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question is \\"ore\\" because it is the starting material required to obtain refined minerals. The process of extracting and refining minerals from ores is crucial for the production of various metals and minerals that play a significant role in modern society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: order, tiredness, neatness, pass out, invigorating  Why is \\"tiredness\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The answer \\"tiredness\\" aligns with human common sense because cleaning a house typically involves a variety of physical activities that can lead to exhaustion. It might involve sweeping, mopping, dusting, scrubbing, lifting heavy objects, bending over repeatedly, and moving around a lot, among other strenuous activities. All of these tasks require energy and can be quite tiring especially if the cleaning is comprehensive and involves a large area or multiple rooms. Moreover, cleaning is not just physically tiring, it can also be mentally exhausting. Determining what needs to be cleaned, strategizing the quickest and most efficient ways to do so, figuring out stubborn stains or problems, and deciding what should be thrown away or kept can all engage and tire the mind. It's a decision-making process that requires planning and execution. In addition to the physical exertion and mental strain, the duration of the cleaning process plays into the feeling of tiredness as well. Cleaning a house thoroughly is not usually a quick task; it could take hours depending on the size of the house and the extent of cleaning required. The longer an individual engages in such an energy-demanding task like this, the more likely they are to feel tired afterward. Therefore, based on an understanding of what house cleaning entails, \\"tiredness\\" is indeed an outcome that is heavily linked with the aftermath of house-cleaning activities as per human common sense. It fully aligns with the realities of the physical, psychological, and time demands that come with cleaning a house. Hence, when people refer to the aftereffects of cleaning, feeling tired or fatigued is a logical conclusion that is in line with typical human experience and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Since 1970, the responsibility of manufacturing and supplying the official match balls for the FIFA World Cup has been with Adidas, a German multinational corporation. Adidas holds a long-standing relationship with FIFA, and this collaboration has not only produced iconic footballs over the years but also played a significant role in advancing the technology involved in the manufacturing process. Let's take a look at the World Cup footballs created by Adidas since 1970: 1. 1970 Mexico - Adidas Telstar: The Adidas Telstar was introduced during the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. It was the first football to have a 32-panel design featuring 12 black pentagonal and 20 white hexagonal panels. This ball was named after the Telstar communications satellite as its pattern resembled the satellite's appearance. The black and white pattern was specifically chosen to enhance visibility on television. 2. 1974 Germany - Adidas Telstar Durlast: This ball was an updated version of the original Telstar with a more durable external layer, making it more resistant to water absorption. The design retained the iconic black and white colors. 3. 1978 Argentina - Adidas Tango España: This ball was introduced in the 1978 World Cup held in Argentina. The Adidas Tango España retained the 32-panel design, but introduced a new and visually appealing triangular graphic pattern. This iconic design made a significant impact and set the trend for future football designs. 4. 1982 Spain - Adidas Tango España: Though it shared its name with the 1978 version, this ball included improvements in its waterproofing capabilities. It featured a rubberized, sealed-seam, and polyurethane coating, making it more durable and water-resistant. 5. 1986 Mexico - Adidas Azteca: The 1986 World Cup saw the introduction of the Adidas Azteca, which was the first synthetic leather ball used in a World Cup. The ball consisted of a unique Aztec-inspired design to represent the host nation, Mexico. The use of synthetic leather increased the ball's durability and water resistance. 6. 1990 Italy - Adidas Etrusco Unico: The Etrusco Unico celebrated the rich history of Italy with its Etruscan lion design. It was built with an internal layer of black polyurethane foam which improved the ball's resilience and made it softer and more responsive to touch. 7. 1994 United States - Adidas Questra: The name 'Questra' was derived from a combination of the words \\"quest\\" and \\"star.\\" The Adidas Questra featured a space-inspired design, referring to America's advancements in space technology. A layer of polystyrene foam was incorporated, which increased the ball's velocity and control upon striking. 8. 1998 France - Adidas Tricolore: This ball was a tribute to the French flag, featuring blue and red colors on a white background. The Adidas Tricolore was constructed with a foam layer and a more advanced synthetic material, improving its performance and making it even more water-resistant. 9. 2002 South Korea & Japan - Adidas Fevernova: The Fevernova was introduced with a completely new design, featuring a gold, red, and black color scheme. The ball incorporated a refined syntactic foam layer which offered enhanced accuracy, control, and a more predictable flight trajectory. 10. 2006 Germany - Adidas Teamgeist: This ball featured a 14-panel design, a significant reduction from the traditional 32 panels. This change resulted in a smoother surface with fewer seams, enhancing the ball's precision and control. The ball had a patriotic black, red, and gold color scheme to represent the host nation. 11. 2010 South Africa - Adidas Jabulani: The Jabulani, meaning 'to celebrate' in Zulu, incorporated an 8-panel design with grip-enhancing micro-texture and a unique 3D structure. This ball was known for its unpredictable flight, prompting criticism from some players and goalkeepers. 12. 2014 Brazil - Adidas Brazuca: The Brazuca featured a vibrant color scheme and a 6-panel design. It underwent extensive tests and proved to perform more consistently in terms of flight pattern and control. Its name was chosen by the Brazilian public through an online poll. 13. 2018 Russia - Adidas Telstar 18: The Telstar 18 was a modern reinvention of the original Telstar design. It featured a 6-panel structure and a textured surface for better grip and control. This ball also included an embedded NFC chip, allowing users to interact and access exclusive content through their smartphones. As evident from the list above, Adidas has made significant contributions to the development and evolution of the official World Cup footballs, constantly pushing the boundaries of innovation and design to improve performance and aesthetic appeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - They expand to take the air in  - The cells of the lung hold the air - They take in the air and remove the Oxygen - They inflate and all the bad air leaves through the mouth - They do it all over again.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the liver is not able to filter happens, how will it affect lung continuously expands to make more oxygen.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process described outlines the key steps involved in the human respiratory system's functioning, which are primarily centered around the lungs. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining an adequate supply of oxygen, critical for the body's functioning, and disposing of carbon dioxide, a metabolic waste product. To better understand the process, let's break it down into several stages: 1. Inhalation: During this phase, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, resulting in increased space for the lungs to expand. This expansion draws air into the lungs through the nose and mouth. 2. Gas exchange: The bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli within the lungs facilitate the passing of inhaled oxygen into the bloodstream and the movement of waste carbon dioxide from the bloodstream back into the lungs. 3. Transportation: Once the oxygen has entered the bloodstream, it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, which deliver it to cells throughout the body. Simultaneously, cells release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of metabolism, which is transported back to the lungs. 4. Exhalation: The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, reducing the available space within the chest cavity and causing the lungs to contract, pushing the carbon dioxide-laden air out of the body. The perturbation hypothesis in question proposes that the liver's inability to filter properly might impact the lungs' ability to expand and generate more oxygen. While it is true that the liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying the blood, synthesizing proteins, and metabolizing nutrients, it does not have a direct impact on lung functioning and expansion. However, there may be indirect effects. If the liver is unable to filter toxins effectively, this may lead to the buildup of harmful substances in the blood. As the blood transports oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, poor liver function could result in less efficient systemic oxygen delivery as dangerous substances accumulate. This systemic dysfunction could stress the body as a whole, possibly even increasing the body's demand for oxygen and causing the lungs to work harder. Furthermore, if the liver fails to efficiently metabolize nutrients, it may affect the body's energy production, which could ultimately result in decreased muscular efficiency, including the muscles used during respiration (e.g., the diaphragm and intercostal muscles). This weakening could affect the ability to expand the lungs fully or maintain steady breathing patterns. Thus, although the liver's impaired filtration capacity does not directly alter the lungs' ability to continuously expand and generate oxygen, it may indirectly influence the efficiency of the respiratory process through systemic dysfunction and compromised energy production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: More American Graffiti Movie plot: The film, set over the course of four consecutive New Year's Eves from 1964 to 1967, depicts scenes from each of these years, intertwined with one another as though events happen simultaneously. The audience is protected from confusion by the use of a distinct cinematic style for each section. For example, the 1966 sequences echo the movie of Woodstock using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen, the 1965 sequences (set in Vietnam) shot hand-held on grainy super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage. The film attempts to memorialize the 1960s with sequences that recreate the sense and style of those days with references to Haight-Ashbury, the campus peace movement, the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt. One character burned his draft card, showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. Other characters are shown frantically disposing of their marijuana before a traffic stop as a police officer pulls them over, and another scene shows the police brutality with billy clubs during an anti-Vietnam protest. The listed fates of the main characters at the ending sequence of American Graffiti were updated again at the end of this sequel. In More American Graffiti, John Milner was revealed to have been killed by a drunk driver in December 1964, with the ending scene of the movie driving his trademark yellow Deuce at night on a lonely, hilly highway toward another vehicle's headlights. After disappearing over a small hill, neither his taillights nor the approaching car's headlights are seen again, hinting that the fatal crash occurred there. Set on New Year's Eve 1964, it is never actually shown that his tragic end comes after his racing win on the last day of the year, very probably instead into the first few moments of 1965, given that the 1967 segment was just barely into 1968.

Q:Information:  - A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.  - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.  - Angina pectoris, commonly known as angina, is the sensation of chest pain, pressure, or squeezing, often due to not enough blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries.  While angina pectoris can occur due to anemia, abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure, its main cause is coronary artery disease, an atherosclerotic process affecting the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the Latin \\"angere\\" (\\"to strangle\\") and \\"pectus\\" (\\"chest\\"), and can therefore be translated as \\"a strangling feeling in the chest\\".  - Tritium (or ; symbol ' or ', also known as hydrogen-3) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with cosmic rays. It is produced by irradiating lithium metal in a nuclear reactor. Tritium is used as a radioactive tracer, in radioluminescent light sources for watches and instruments, and in nuclear weapons. The name of this isotope is formed from the Greek word  (\\"trítos\\") meaning \\"third\\".  - A radioactive tracer, or radioactive label, is a chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope so by virtue of its radioactive decay it can be used to explore the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracing the path that the radioisotope follows from reactants to products. Radiolabeling is thus the radioactive form of isotopic labeling.  - Lithium (from , \\"stone\\") is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.  - AstraZeneca plc is a BritishSwedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to Cambridge, England, and concentrated its R&D in three sites: Cambridge, Gaithersburg, Maryland (location of MedImmune) for work on biopharmaceuticals, and Mölndal (near Gothenburg) in Sweden, for research on traditional chemical drugs. In 2015 it was the eighth largest drug company in the world based on sales revenue.  - Alprenolol, or alfeprol, alpheprol, and alprenololum (Gubernal, Regletin, Yobir, Apllobal, Aptine, Aptol Duriles), is a non-selective beta blocker as well as 5-HT receptor antagonist, used in the treatment of angina pectoris. It is no longer marketed by AstraZeneca, but may still be available from other pharmaceutical companies or generically.  - A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research. Today there are about 450 nuclear power reactors that are used to generate electricity in about 30 countries around the world.  - Dihydroalprenolol ( DHA ) is a hydrogenated alprenolol derivative that acts as a beta - adrenergic blocker . When the extra hydrogen atoms are tritium , it is a radiolabeled form of alprenolol , which is used to label beta - adrenergic receptors for isolation .  - Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation, mainly originating outside the Solar System. Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface. Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin. Data from the \\"Fermi\\" space telescope (2013) have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernovae explosions of stars. Active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays.  - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients.  - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons.  - A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\\"atomic\\") bomb released the same amount of energy as approximately .

Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What are the most important words in the following sentence: magnolia and a tree with white flowers","output":"In the sentence, \\"magnolia and a tree with white flowers\\", the most important words are \\"magnolia\\", \\"tree\\", and \\"white flowers\\". Here's a breakdown of why these words hold significance in this context: 1. Magnolia - This word serves as the central focus of the sentence. A magnolia is a type of tree known for its beautiful, fragrant flowers that come in various colors, including white. By mentioning the magnolia, the author is most likely referring to the tree's appearance, its flowers, or the specific environment where it typically grows. Magnolias provide visual appeal and can greatly improve the aesthetic of a garden or landscape, making them an important choice for gardeners and homeowners. 2. Tree - The word \\"tree\\" is crucial in this sentence as it helps to establish what kind of magnolia is being referred to; in this case, the magnolia tree. The tree also indicates that the subject of the sentence is plant-related and that the author might be talking about plant or tree species, landscapes, or gardening. Trees are vital to the earth's ecosystem and provide a myriad of benefits such as purifying the air, providing habitats for wildlife, preventing soil erosion, and offering shade to humans. 3. White flowers - The term \\"white flowers\\" contributes significantly to the visual descriptor of the subject in question. By specifying that the tree has white flowers, a reader can better visualize the tree being discussed. The mention of white flowers could also imply that the author is talking about a specific type of magnolia or tree – one with white blossoms. White flowers are symbolically associated with purity, innocence, and elegance, which might contribute to their significance in this context. In summary, \\"magnolia\\", \\"tree\\", and \\"white flowers\\" are the most important words in the sentence, as they give the reader a better understanding of the subject and help paint a vivid picture of the tree being described. These words provide insight into plant characteristics and set the stage for possible further discussions about botany, gardening, or landscape design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What nurtures frogs, lizards and various insects?  Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the...

Competition: We don't have information about the skills, speed, and performance of other racers participating in the BMX race. It's possible that other racers are pedaling just as fast or even faster than the young boy. Therefore, the boy's quick pedaling does not guarantee a victory in the race. 2. Race progress: We don't know how far along the race is or how many laps are left to complete. Even if the boy is leading in a particular lap or moment of the race, we cannot determine if he will maintain his lead or if he can endure the entire race. 3. Race conditions: The statement does not provide information on the race course, including terrain, obstacles, and weather conditions that could affect the boy's performance and, in turn, his chances of winning the race. BMX races occur on various courses with differing levels of difficulty, and these factors will contribute to the outcome of the race. 4. Strategy and tactics: In many athletic competitions, strategy and tactics play significant roles in overall performance and winning. We don't know if the young boy has a good strategy or if he can adapt to the unfolding race situation. 5. Fatigue and endurance: Pedaling quickly may or may not be sustainable for the entire race, depending on the boy's physical condition, fitness, and experience. He could potentially experience fatigue or exhaustion, which could negatively impact his chances of winning. 6. Unforeseen events: Accidents, mechanical issues, or other unexpected occurrences could happen during the race, potentially impacting the young boy's performance and chances of winning. For example, he could fall or his bike might malfunction, which could affect his position in the race. In conclusion, despite the fact that \\"The young boy pedals quickly at a BMX race,\\" it does not logically follow that \\"The boy is about to win the race.\\" There are many influencing factors, such as competition, race progress, race conditions, strategy, fatigue, endurance, and unforeseen events that could determine the outcome of the race. While quick pedaling may be a positive factor, it cannot guarantee that the boy will win the race."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Vaginitis and vulvovaginitis are the medical terms which describe an inflammation of the vagina and/or vulva from bacteria, viruses, or chemical irritants contained in creams, soaps and lotions. Bacterial vaginosis is often the result of normal bacteria in the vagina growing at abnormal rates. There are some steps you can take to reduce your chances of developing vaginitis.  Do not douche. Douching changes the pH of the environment in the vagina and increases the risk of a bacterial infection. Limit yourself to one sexual partner. Those with multiple sexual partners are at a higher risk of developing bacterial vaginosis. Do not smoke. Smoking is associated with increased risk of developing a bacterial infection in the vagina. Bacterial infections in the throat are called pharyngitis. This refers to the inflammation and infection of the pharynx, or the back of the throat. There are specific strategies you can take to reduce the potential that you will get a throat infection.  Wash your hands after you’ve been in public or have been around anyone who has an upper respiratory condition. Wash your hands after blowing your own nose or caring for a child with a runny nose and/or sore throat. Do not share eating or drinking utensils with children or with an adult who appears to have a throat infection or a sore throat. Keep a sick person’s utensils separate from the rest and wash them thoroughly with hot, soapy water. Wash any toys that a toddler with pharyngitis has been playing with. Use hot soapy water, rinse well, and then dry thoroughly. Dispose of any used tissues right away. Avoid kissing or sharing eating utensils with someone who has the flu, a cold, mononucleosis, or a known bacterial infection. Do not smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Use a humidifier if the air in your home is dry. Keeping your neck warm with a scarf during colder months can also protect you by keeping a body temperature that is less hospitable to bacterial and viral growth. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs which can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. This infection is very serious and can cause death. Some groups of people are at higher risk of developing pneumonia and should practice preventative measures carefully. Take extra precautions if you:  Smoke cigarettes or use other tobacco products Have recently had a respiratory infection such as the flu, a cold, or laryngitis Have a medical condition which impairs your ability to swallow, such as a stroke, dementia, or Parkinson’s disease Suffer from chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, or bronchiectasis Have other serious medical conditions such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes Have recently had surgery or a physical trauma Have a weakened immune system from an underlying medical condition or certain medications Children are more likely to suffer from internal ear infections, which are painful and can lead to other health problems. You may be able to reduce your child’s chances of getting a middle ear infection by following some simple suggestions. Do not smoke in your home or around children. Ear infections are more common in children who are exposed to secondhand smoke. If possible, breastfeed your children when they are infants. Breast feeding helps develop a stronger immune system, which reduces the risk of ear infections. Never let your baby drink from a bottle while he or she is lying down. Because of the structure of the ears and tube which drains the middle ear, lying down while drinking significantly increases the risk of an ear infection. Reduce your child’s exposure to other children who are sick. Keep your child’s hands clean and washed, as children often enjoy putting their hands in their mouths. Swimmer’s ear is an infection in the outer ear canal triggered by water remaining in the outer ear which creates a warm, moist environment for bacterial growth. This is also known as acute external otitis or otitis externa. To reduce your chances of developing swimmer’s ear:  Keep your ears dry after swimming and bathing. Dry your outer ear with a soft towel or cloth. Tip your head to one side and then the other to assist water to drain out. Dry the ear canal with a hair dryer on the lowest setting and holding it at least one foot from your head. Do not put foreign objects in the ear such as cotton swabs, paper clips, or hairpins. Put cotton balls in your ears when you apply irritating products such as hair sprays and hair dyes. Bacterial infections can also affect your brain. Between 2003-2007, there were 4,100 cases of bacterial meningitis each year, including 500 deaths. Antibiotic treatments improve survival rates, lowering the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, but prevention with vaccination works best. Take the following steps to help reduce your risk of contracting bacterial meningitis:  Wash your hands often. Do not share drinks, eating utensils, lip balms, or toothbrushes with anyone. Maintain a good immune system by getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night, drinking at least 64 ounces of water each day, getting 30 minutes of exercise each day, taking a multivitamin and eating a well-balanced diet. Consider getting vaccinated against bacterial meningitis. Some forms of bacterial meningitis are preventable with vaccinations. Ask your doctor about getting vaccinated to help protect yourself. Bacterial meningitis can be spread through airborne droplets, so if you know anyone who has bacterial meningitis, it is best to avoid close contact, and to wear a face mask. Septicemia or sepsis is uncontrolled bacterial infection blood. When bacteria is growing in the blood it can also infect other organ systems in the body, such as the kidneys, pancreas, liver, and spleen.  Different types of infections can lead to sepsis, such as those on the skin, lungs, urinary tract, and abdomen, or it can be a primary infection in the blood. Some people are at higher risk of developing sepsis, including people who have a weakened immune system, infants and children, elderly people, those with a chronic illness such as diabetes, cancer, liver disease or HIV/AIDS, and people who have suffered from a severe physical trauma or severe burn. Take extra precautions if you are at risk. You can help to prevent sepsis through preventing other primary bacterial infections, helping to boost your immune system, and taking care of any chronic health conditions. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses various bacterial infections, including vaginitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, internal ear infections, swimmer's ear, bacterial meningitis, and septicemia, and provides preventive measures to reduce the risk of developing these infections. The preventive steps suggested include maintaining good hygiene, limiting exposure to infected individuals, strengthening the immune system, following vaccination recommendations, and taking extra precautions for individuals at higher risk of developing certain infections, such as those with weakened immune systems, chronic illnesses, or belonging to specific age groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not.  But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the child of the person that began to use LSD and lose interest in his wife? , can you please find it?   Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret.

Q: Article: In modem society there is a great deal of argument about competition.Some value it highly,believing that it is responsible for social progress and prosperity.Others say that competition is bad, that it sets one person against another and that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth relied on how well they performed at tennis and other skills.For them,playing well and winning are often life-and-death affair. In their single-minded pursuit of success,the development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However,while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed,others take an opposite attitude.In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the ordinary players,they strongly blame competition.Among _ are youngsters who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society.Teaching these young people,I often observe in them a desire to fail.They seem to seek failure by not trying to win or achieve success .By not trying,they always have an excuse:\\"I may have lost,but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.'' What is not usually admitted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost,that would mean a lot.Such a loss would be a measure of their worth. Clearly,this belief is the same as that of the true competitors who try to prove themselves.Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-respect relies on how well one performs in comparison with others.Both are afraid of not being valued.Only as this basic and often troublesome fear begins to dissolve can we discover a new meaning in competition.   Question: What does this passage mainly talk about?   Options: (A) Competition helps to set up self-respect. (B) Opinions about competition are different among people. (C) Competition is harmful to personal quality development. (D) Failures are necessary experiences in competition.

Based on the premise \\"Her outstretched hand pointed over Tuppence's head.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands. \\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"Her outstretched hand pointed over Tuppence's head,\\" we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands\\" is true. In fact, the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis. Here we have a detailed analysis: 1. Understanding the premise: The statement given is explicit in mentioning that \\"Her outstretched hand pointed over Tuppence's head.\\" This clearly conveys that the person in question has at least one hand, which she outstretched and pointed over Tuppence's head. At this point, we can infer that she possesses the physical ability to move her hand and point towards something, as demonstrated by her action in the premise. 2. Analyzing the hypothesis: The hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands\\" negates the presence of any hands for the person in question. According to this hypothesis, she would not be capable of any hand-related actions or movement since she supposedly doesn't have any hands. 3. Contradiction between premise and hypothesis: The premise mentioned earlier explicitly contradicts the hypothesis. The premise clearly describes a scene where the person performed a hand-related action, which indicates the existence of at least one hand. On the other hand, the hypothesis negates the presence of any hands altogether. 4. Conclusion: Considering the analysis above, we can infer that the hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands\\" is not true based on the given premise. The premise itself provides evidence that contradicts the hypothesis, thereby disproving it.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What town could you take a tour of the Chalcedony Forest from?, using the article: After the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good east–west routes along the 35th parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate 40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Visitors could take a tour of the Chalcedony Forest from the town of Adamana.  Step 1: Identify the key information in the given article.

Given the question: Given the background: The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. As shown in Figure below , the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court!  and the situation: Robert and John both went to the doctor because they had been having stomach problems. The doctor decided to take images of the men's jejunum to try and diagnose the issues. He discovered that Robert has more villi covering his jejunum compared to John.  Answer the following question: Who has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients? The answer is:","output":"Robert has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients. Step 1: Understand the background information From the given background, we know that the jejunum is the part of the small intestine responsible for nutrient absorption. The villi, which are tiny fingerlike projections, increase the surface area for absorption in the jejunum. Step 2: Analyze the situation In the situation, both Robert and John went to the doctor with stomach problems. Images of their jejunum were taken to diagnose the issues. Step 3: Compare the number of villi According to the discovered information, Robert has more villi covering his jejunum than John. Step 4: Relate the number of villi to the surface area As mentioned in the background information, the presence of a greater number of villi increases the surface area for absorption. Step 5: Determine who has more surface area for absorption Since Robert has more villi in his jejunum compared to John, it means Robert has a larger surface area available for the absorption of nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them.  Now, I have a new situation: Bob and Andy were two nature enthusiasts. They went camping together once a month. Bob was into bird watching, while Andy was fascinated with frogs and salamanders. They went on a trip last week-end and they were very happy with what they had observed.  Answer this question please: Which friend heard more males producing a mating call? The answer is:","output":"Andy. Step-by-step justification: 1. The background information provided is about frog mating calls. Specifically, it discusses that males produce these calls to attract females and that each frog species has a different call. 2. The new situation introduces two friends, Bob and Andy. Bob is interested in bird watching, while Andy is fascinated with frogs and salamanders. 3. Since Andy has a fascination with frogs and salamanders, he is more likely to be paying attention to and recognizing the mating calls of male frogs. On the other hand, Bob's interest in bird watching would lead him to focus more on the birds and their calls. 4. Therefore, Andy would be the friend who heard more males producing a mating call, as his focus and interest lie in observing and understanding frogs and their behavior, including their mating calls."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect  that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean.

In addition to the two men shot dead, a lone body has been found inside the charred ruins of the Modesto, California, apartment building, Modesto police Officer Chris Adams told CNN on Friday. He did not say definitively that this was the same person being sought out for the eviction notice, adding that it could take days or weeks to positively identify the body.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes').

Nic is an obstetrician, and Jules is a housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor. The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor father but has to be 18 to do so.

However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.  Question: \\"Who were on opposite sides of the idea to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center?\\" Answer: \\"FBI\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct.

Hippocampus Translate to Russian","output":"Гиппокамп Гиппокамп (или \\"морская лошадка\\") - это часть мозга, которая находится внутри его долей (височные доли) и является компонентом лимбической системы. Название гиппокамп происходит от греческих слов \\"hippos\\", означающего \\"лошадь\\", и \\"kampos\\", означающего \\"морской монстр\\". Это связано с формой этой структуры мозга, поскольку она напоминает морскую лошадку. Гиппокамп играет важную роль в процессе образования и сохранения долгосрочной памяти, особенно в явных или декларативных видах памяти, таких как факты или события. Когда поступающая информация доходит до гиппокампа, он помогает определить, следует ли хранить ее, как важную и значимую информацию, или же можно отбросить как что-то незначительное или неважное. Существует две симметричные части гиппокампа - правая и левая, каждая из которых выполняет разные функции. Правый гиппокамп отвечает за кодирование пространственной информации, а также связан с обработкой визуальных образов и эмоций. Левый гиппокамп, с другой стороны, отвечает за вербальную и языковую информацию. При некоторых заболеваниях, таких как альцгеймера, гиппокамп может страдать от дегенерации и потери нейронов, что приводит к снижению когнитивных функций и проблемам с памятью. В некоторых случаях, например, при постоянном стрессе, гиппокамп также может быть поврежден, вызывая затруднения в обучении и возникновении новых воспоминаний. Важно отметить, что гиппокамп не является единственной структурой мозга, отвечающей за факты, события и платоническую память. Факты обрабатываются неолимбическим кортом, события связываются с местами лобной коры, а эмоциональные аспекты памяти обрабатывает амигдала.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: For nearly 30 years, one man has dominated Egypt. Hosni Mubarak, 82, has survived would-be assassins and ill health, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed. His government's continued observance of the Camp David accords with Israel is the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict. Following the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman, demonstrators in the streets of Cairo are standing up to riot police and chanting, \\"Mubarak, Saudi Arabia is waiting for you.\\" Experienced observers say it's the most most significant challenge to his rule yet. It's far from clear, however, that the demonstrators have the support or the coordination to bring down the man critics have called Egypt's last pharaoh. \\"He's been in power a very long time, and he is very wily,\\" said Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan. \\"He's developed all kinds of techiniques for dealing with opponents that have proven relatively successful.\\" But longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak has purchased has come at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world's most populous nation. \\"Egypt is a broken country,\\" Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN. \\"It used to be the jewel of the Middle East. It's the capital of its cultural production.\\" But now, Gerges said, \\"Egyptians have no outlets. They don't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future.\\" Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt's air force during the 1973 Mideast war. The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero, and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975. Six years later, Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade, killed by Islamic militants from within the army's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel. Upon assuming office, one of Mubarak's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that allowed barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely. He has made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades. The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986, and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists. \\"He pretty much wiped them out,\\" Cole said. \\"It's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt.\\" And the government has also penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that \\"If five people sit down to plot something, the fifth person writes a report to Hosni Mubarak about it,\\" he said. The result is \\"a regime that has very little legitimacy, but presents itself as something there's no point in trying to change,\\" said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. But Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power, has changed the thinking of many in the region. \\"I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. Mubarak has headed off a similar movement before, in 2005, when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform. He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests, Brown said. But the current movement \\"has no real leadership, so it can't be decapitated the same way,\\" he said. \\"If Mubarak decided tomorrow, 'I'll sit down and engage with you,' it's not clear who that 'you' is.\\" Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities. His fifth, in 2005, was Egypt's first multi-party presidential vote, but it was widely criticized as a \\"sham,\\" Cole said. Meanwhile, the country's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule. Development has picked up in the past decade, fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars, but its gains have been \\"very unevenly distributed.\\" About 40 percent of Egyptians currently live in poverty, Gerges said. The aging autocrat has escaped at least two assassination attempts, including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia. And in recent years, he has had several bouts of illness but has never picked a vice president. He is widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor, but no formal announcement has been made. In 2003, he collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu. He had back surgery in Germany in 2004, returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. He has largely withdrawn from public view in recent years and has not addressed his country during the current crisis, Brown said. His situation is being closely watched overseas, particularly in the United States. In the past decade, Egypt has been major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. It gets about 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly 30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures. But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- and while sticking with Camp David, Egypt's ties with Israel amount to a \\"cold peace,\\" Cole said. President Barack Obama noted Thursday that Mubarak has been \\"very helpful on a range of tough issues,\\" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform. \\"You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets,\\" Obama said. He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the demonstrations, adding, \\"I think it's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances.\\" Brown said Mubarak probably has to endorse some political form to survive. But he will have to do it \\"extremely carefully, so it's not seen as a desperate measure of last resort.\\" Cole said Mubarak could bow to one of the protesters' demands and lift the state of emergency. \\"Egypt does have a fairly liberal constitution and it does enshrine a lot of rights in it,\\" he said. \\"But it's just a piece of paper. It's sidestepped by the emergency.\\" If lifted, \\"The judges and the courts in Egypt are very feisty, and they will take on the government.\\" He could also hold a free and fair presidential election this year, \\"but it's asking a lot,\\" Cole said. But Gerges said the Middle East has seen \\"the barrier of fear\\" removed since the events in Tunisia. \\"Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus, regardless of whether Mubarak remains or goes,\\" he said. \\"We're going to have a new era of politics.\\"","output":"Hosni Mubarak has been a powerful leader in Egypt for around 30 years. He has been able to stay in power and keep peace with a neighboring country called Israel, which is very important. People in Egypt have started to protest because they want a new leader and change in their country. They are inspired by the people in Tunisia who removed their leader as well. So far, Mubarak has been able to stay in power, but people think that he might have to make some changes to keep the people happy. Egypt is an important country, so everyone is watching closely to see what will happen."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - Miss International (\\"Miss International Beauty\\" or \\"The International Beauty Pageant\\") is a Tokyo-based international beauty pageant organized by The International Culture Association.

Figures suggest millions were swept up by the frenzy into making purchases they did not want simply because goods were cheaper. More than £800million was spent online on Friday and £720 million on so-called Cyber Monday this week during the growing trend for websites and stores to offer pre-Christmas sales. But CollectPlus, a parcel rival to the Post Office, has seen a seen a 30 per cent rise in parcel returns this week compared to an average week. Scroll down for video. There were ugly scenes at shops last Friday as bargain-hungry shoppers fought over discount TVs. The fights came as £810million was spent online - with a similar amount taken by shops and supermarkets. Most appear to be hastily bought items from Black Friday and Cyber Monday, returned quickly by those hoping to get their money back in time to spend on Christmas. The post-Black Friday surge will result in an estimated 31 per cent of online purchases being returned, according to a survey of more than 2,000 adult customers. And it could cost British business up to £505 million in lost productivity and employee absence as the average customer will each spend 52 minutes returning parcels this Christmas, said the research. Almost one in five Britons have taken time off work to return a purchase, said CollectPlus CEO Neil Ashworth. The rush to buy online bargains caused a number of retailers' websites to crash under the strain. This Amazon warehouse in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire had to process millions of orders. Mr Ashworth said: 'With the increased enthusiasm for 'Black Friday' and 'Cyber Monday', we expect to see a sharp returns peak this week. 'Our research tells us that the average shopper is taking valuable time and losing money each year due to complicated or costly returns. 'As such, it is imperative that retailers have a robust model in place to ensure that customers can conveniently return any unwanted items and are quickly reimbursed.' The boom in online shopping has led to a sharp rise in the number of British shoppers returning purchases by post, as opposed to just going into a store for a refund or exchange. Natalie Berg, of research analysts Planet Retail, added: 'The frenzied nature of this year's Black Friday and, to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday events will have resulted in some panic buying. 'Having had time to reflect on whether such purchases are actually worth keeping, or indeed if it they were genuine bargains at all, many shoppers will be looking to return items this week.'

Peter wanted to know what he needed to do to venture out on his own and start his own acting academy. Many of us find ourselves daydreaming about making such a bold life change, but few of us do it. So what is stopping us from taking the leap? Why don’t we have the courage to invest in ourselves? Peter and his wife, Jeannie, sat down with me to chart out a plan. We determined that they needed four major boxes to be checked for Peter’s dream business to have a real shot at success: Let me break these down: 1. Support from the spouse: Peter and Jeannie had to be in full agreement that they were both ready to take on this new adventure together. In the beginning, they would have significant upfront investments in staffing, infrastructure, and signing a lease for the business. Money would be tight. 2. Cash reserves: Peter was concerned. “How much money can we free up for the startup costs?” he asked. We discussed the couple’s financial concerns, reviewed financial goals for their family, and acknowledged the trade-offs and sacrifices they would need to make. We determined a figure they were comfortable investing in their new business. Then we built a business plan around that number. 3. Business plan: It has been said that a goal without a plan is just a wish. Peter and Jeannie needed a written plan in place so that their wish could become a reality. Their business plan would serve as a step-by-step guide to building and growing the acting academy. It included projections for revenues, expenses, marketing strategies, and one-time costs. Once we wrote the business plan, we had one final step remaining: the step that so many of us don’t have the courage to take. Peter and Jeannie had to trust in themselves, believe in their plan, and… 4. Take the Leap: Regardless of how confident we are, how prepared we feel, and how much support we have, this is a scary step. We have to walk away from our reliable paycheck, go down an unfamiliar road, and head out into the unknown. I’m happy to share that Peter and Jeannie’s story is one of great success. They faced obstacles and bumps along the way, but Peter persevered and succeeded in accomplishing his goal. He is now running a thriving acting academy with multiple instructors and a growing staff. If you decide to invest in yourself, you will need to take the four steps too. Joe O’Boyle is a financial adviser with Voya Financial Advisors.

After my thirdgrade year,my dad landed a lifechanging job in Manhattan.My mom,my little sister and I had to move away from our hometown,Chicago,and leave my grandmother and her beautiful food behind. Leaving my grandmother was far more frightening than the move to New York City.There would be no more special weekends at my grandmother's house,the only place I can remember feeling happy,safe and nourished  .It was what I desired.In this new city,I felt extremely alone and lost,and I missed my grandmother terribly. My grandmother knew just how I felt--And she knew the _ .Every week,she would send me a card with a 20 bill,a recipe and a list of what to buy at the market.It kept us bonded,and her recipes filled my body and soul. Over the years,I have grown to better understand my father's struggles with weight and the toll   it took on him and those who love him.I have come to realize he was driven not by vanity   or selfishness as much as by a deep pain.And in spite of growing up in such an unhealthy eating environment (or perhaps because of it),as an adult I found a passion and a career as a nutrition consultant. Today,my father weighs 220 pounds and is a vegan  .How he got there is a story I hope to share in the coming weeks.More importantly,food is no longer a barrier that keeps us apart,but a bridge that keep us connected.There is nothing my dad enjoys more than talking with me about dietary theories and his weightloss victories.And now I am the one regularly sending recipe cards to my father's house,just as my grandmother did for me.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What act removed the inscription that included accusations against Catholics?  Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...

Question: This article: The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward.

Question: How do the waiters occupy themselves in the movie \\"Waiting\\"? Movie title: Waiting... Movie plot: Dean is a 22 year old waiter at \\"Shenaniganz,\\" a restaurant with a colorful crew and an irreverent disdain for the customer. He is stuck in the point of his life which makes him crave more than a crappy job at a restaurant and a couple classes per semester. When he is offered the job of assistant manager, he is forced to consider the potential benefits/disadvantages of accepting, beating himself up over the fact that his high school classmate recently graduated as an electrical engineer -- a fact his mother reminded him of at their lunch meeting at the start of the movie.Along with his roommate, Dean lives in a house that is the constant host of parties for everyone working at the restaurant, which only makes him wonder even more about his place in life.Dean's roommate Monty is an individual extremely concerned with his getting of the poontang, and throughout the course of the movie his comments are lewd, in-your-face reminders of his sexual perversion and infinite coolness. Monty's current objective is the underage hostess at the restaurant, Natasha, who provokes incessantly an occurrence of statuatory rape between the two [however, when the chance does finally arrive for Monty, he wusses out because she is too young].The movie takes place during Mitch's first day and the nature of things in the restaurant is displayed as Monty tours him around, yet never lets him speak. The \\"penis-showing game\\" is the focus of the crew's entertainment -- a game which consists of the male workers showing each other their genitalia in various different shapes and forms. If the other player looks, he gets one or more kicks in the ass. Mitch gets a glimpse of all the characters, including the busboys Nick and T-dawg [two wankstas who hang out by the dumpsters and eat all the vegetables after getting a little green], the bartenders [a sultry lesbian and a sexy lady who is dating the even sexier cook Raddimus -- inventor of the penis showing game and lover of handjobs], the Bishop [the resident philosopher/therapist who also... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Waiting,\\" the waiters occupy themselves through various activities and interactions that reveal their unique personalities and quirks. One of the primary sources of entertainment for the crew is the \\"penis-showing game\\" where male workers attempt to trick each other into looking at their genitalia. The game involves creating different shapes and forms with their genitals and, if the other player looks, they get one or more kicks in the ass. Apart from the \\"penis-showing game,\\" the waiters engage in humorous and sarcastic banter with each other, often making fun of their customers behind their backs. They deal with their boredom and dissatisfaction by building relationships with their co-workers and creating drama in the workplace. Some also engage in flirtatious and sexual behavior, like Monty, whose goal is to seduce the underage hostess, Natasha. Other characters, like the busboys Nick and T-dawg, spend their time near the dumpsters, eating discarded vegetables while getting high. The bartenders, a sultry lesbian and a sexy woman dating the cook Raddimus, provide drinks for the crew and contribute to the overall raunchy atmosphere. The Bishop, a resident philosopher/therapist, offers wisdom and advice to whoever needs it. As the movie progresses, the protagonist Dean wrestles with the decision to accept a promotion to assistant manager or seek out better opportunities, as he feels that he's stuck in a dead-end job. The story revolves around the chaotic shenanigans at the restaurant and the characters' attempts to make their work life more bearable and amusing while dealing with their own personal dilemmas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion. Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Question: What is the significance of rhyme and rhythm in the Quranic language, and how do they contribute to the overall effectiveness of conveying its message? Answer: The Quranic language has a unique rhythmic quality that combines elements of both poetry and prose, often referred to as \\"rhymed prose.\\" This distinctive style is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others. Rhyme plays a significant role throughout the Quran, particularly in the earlier Meccan suras, where shorter verses emphasize the rhyming words. This effective form can be observed in examples such as Sura 81. The Quran's rhythmic language, with its changes in rhyme and emphasis on particular words, undoubtedly had a powerful impact on the conscience of its listeners.

Let's dive deeper into the differences between the two: 1. \\"There is no railway station in Kadipur airport that you can reach from Sultanpur by bus.\\" This sentence focuses on Kadipur airport. It implies that while there might be other transportation options in Sultanpur, there isn't a railway station directly located in or serving Kadipur airport. It suggests that there is some form of bus service between Sultanpur and Kadipur airport, but the railway station is not a part of it.

Q:I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"1. Can I stop some of my tweets from appearing in certain Twitter lists? Twitter lists are a feature that allows users to curate and organize accounts they find interesting or relevant into specific categories. As a user, you can create your own lists or follow others' lists. However, once your account is added to a list by someone else, you have no control over which of your tweets will appear in that list's timeline. The whole purpose of the Twitter lists is to allow users to view tweets from the selected group of accounts without any filtering based on content or individual tweets. Unfortunately, as the account owner, you cannot stop some of your tweets from appearing in certain Twitter lists because it is not a functionality provided by Twitter. If you want to prevent your tweets from being visible to specific users, you can set your account to private. This makes your tweets visible only to your approved followers. Nevertheless, keep in mind that this method would also limit your overall visibility on the platform. 2. Is it possible to tweet on Twitter lists? You cannot directly tweet on a Twitter list; lists are simply a tool for organizing and curating Twitter accounts into a specific category. When you tweet as usual from your account, your tweets would be visible to everyone following you or the list(s) you are a part of. To engage with users on a specific list, you can do the following: - Visit the list's timeline and interact with the tweets there (like, retweet, and/or reply to the tweets). - Mention the users from the list in your tweets so that the conversation involves them. - Create a hashtag relevant to the list's topic and use that hashtag in your tweets. Encourage others to use the same hashtag, inspiring conversations around the list's theme. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, the two questions you posed do not have the same meaning. The first question asks if you can prevent certain tweets from appearing in specific Twitter lists, whereas the second question inquires if it is possible to tweet directly within a Twitter list. In summary, you cannot selectively prevent some of your tweets from appearing in certain Twitter lists, nor can you directly tweet on a Twitter list. Twitter lists serve as a means of organizing and curating content by grouping specific accounts under a theme or category. Posting and managing tweets still occurs through your main account without any direct connection to the list itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He was also known as the Gray Man , the Werewolf of Wysteria , the Brooklyn Vampire , the Moon Maniac , and The Boogey Man . A child rapist and cannibal , he boasted that he \`\` had children in every state '' , and at one time stated the number was about 100 . However , it is not known whether he was referring to rapes or cannibalization , nor is it known if the statement was truthful . He was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime . Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide , and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people . He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd , and was convicted and executed by electric chair .  - Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. The sentence that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence, whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an execution. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes or capital offences, and commonly include offences such as murder, treason, espionage, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The term \\"capital\\" is derived from the Latin \\"capitalis\\" (\\"of the head\\", referring to execution by beheading).  - Manslaughter is a legal term for homicide considered by law as less culpable than murder. The distinction between murder and manslaughter is sometimes said to have first been made by the Ancient Athenian lawmaker Draco in the 7th century BCE.  - Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of \\"malice\\", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. \\"Involuntary\\" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent (\\"mens rea\\"), recklessness.  - Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck. The \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" states that hanging in this sense is \\"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \\"hanging\\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the official execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first account of execution by hanging was in Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". In this specialised meaning of the common word \\"hang\\", the past and past participle is \\"hanged\\" instead of \\"hung\\".  - Execution by electrocution, performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes fastened on the head and leg. This execution method, conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo, New York dentist named Alfred P. Southwick, was developed throughout the 1880s as a humane alternative to hanging and first used in 1890. This execution method has been used in the United States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines (its first use there in 1924, last in 1976).  - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.  - Homicide refers to one human being killing another. Homicides can be divided into many overlapping types, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war, euthanasia, and capital punishment and abortion, depending on the circumstances of the death. These different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies; some are considered crimes, while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system.  - The concept of justifiable homicide in criminal law stands on the dividing line between an excuse, a justification, and an exculpation. In certain circumstances, homicide is justified when it prevents greater harm to innocents. A homicide can only be justified if there is sufficient evidence to prove that it was reasonable to believe that the offending party posed an imminent threat to the life or well-being of another, in self-defense. To rule a justifiable homicide, one must objectively prove to a trier of fact, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the victim intended to commit violence. A homicide in this instance is blameless and distinct from the less stringent criteria authorizing deadly force in stand your ground rulings.  - A serial killer is a person who typically murders three or more people, usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification, with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant break (a \\"cooling off period\\") between them. Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers; while most set a threshold of three murders, others extend it to four or lessen it to two. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for example, defines serial killing as \\"a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone\\".

A:","output":"A: The individual who received a patent for the manufacture of chewing gum was Thomas Adams, an American inventor and businessman. The patent was granted on February 14, 1871, with the United States Patent Number US110,626. Thomas Adams was born on May 4, 1818, in Staten Island, New York. He initially started his career as a photographer and also worked as an importer of natural products. In the 1860s, Adams was introduced to chicle, a natural rubber-like substance extracted from the sapodilla tree, which is native to Central and South America. Chicle was being used as a substitute for rubber at the time, and the former Mexican general and politician Antonio López de Santa Anna brought it to Adams in the hopes of founding a rubber company. Adams tried and failed to find a profitable use for chicle as a rubber substitute. However, during his experiments, he discovered that it could be used as a base for a new kind of chewing gum. Realizing the potential of this discovery, Adams shifted his focus and began working on the commercialization of chicle-based chewing gum. Adams received the patent for the manufacture of chewing gum on February 14, 1871. His patent outlined a method for producing chewing gum by boiling and purifying chicle, mixing it with flavorings and other ingredients, and then rolling it into sheets and cutting it into individual pieces. The patent also covered the machinery he designed specifically to streamline the production process. For example, he invented a cutting machine that allowed for a uniform and efficient production of chewing gum. Soon after receiving the patent, Adams founded the first chewing gum factory in the United States and launched his flagship product – Adams New York Chewing Gum. This product became the first mass-produced chewing gum in the country and laid the foundation for the modern chewing gum industry. The success of Adams' company eventually led to the establishment of the American Chicle Company in 1899, which later became a part of the pharmaceutical and consumer goods company Warner-Lambert. In 2000, Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer. Thomas Adams' invention and the patent for the manufacture of chewing gum revolutionized the confectionery industry. Chewing gum soon became a popular and affordable treat in the United States and around the world. It has since evolved into a multi-billion-dollar global industry, with various types of gum available, including sugar-free gum, gum that cleans and whitens teeth, and gum with added vitamins and minerals for health benefits. Adams' innovative creation and entrepreneurship continue to have a lasting impact on the chewing gum market to this very day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

UPDATED:. 00:52 EST, 10 May 2012. A pair of amateur hot air balloonists died when their craft burst into flames as they attempted a high altitude four-mile ascent. Pilot Lee Pibworth, 42, and his passenger Allan Burnett, 55, were killed after their £20,000 balloon plunged towards earth at more than 60mph before crashing into a field at Midsomer Norton in Somerset. An inquest at Flax Bourton was today told that the balloon caught fire before two oxygen cylinders on board exploded after it hit the ground at Prattens Bowls Club on New Year’s Day 2011. Tragic: Lee Pibworth, left, and scout leader Allan Burnett were tragically killed on New Year's Day 2011 when their hot air balloon crashed into a field in North Somerset. Both men sustained horrific injuries in the accident with tree surgeon Mr Pibworth, a father-of-one, dying instantly from chest injuries. The inquest heard that father-of-three Mr Burnett survived the impact but suffered extensive fractures and was unable to escape the blaze alive. The pair from Bristol had decided to undertake the challenge in September 2010 in order for Mr Pibworth to gain the 19,700ft ascent standard necessary to earn a British Balloon and Airship Club gold medal. After spending months meticulously planning the flight they took off from a field in Chelworth just after 9am in front of proud family and friends. A crew with radios - including Mr Burnett’s son Alex - followed the men on the ground in a trailer but lost contact as they ascended into the clouds. Tragic: An aerial GV of the balloon crash site in at a Bowls club in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, where balloonists Allan Burnett and Lee Pibworth died. Alex Burnett, a trainee pilot at the time of the crash, told the inquest he received two calls from his dad during their flight. In the first, BT engineer Mr Burnett said they had reached 4,600 metres but were turning back after using 60 litres of gas. He called a final time to state that they had reached 6,600 metres - higher than required - and were heading to the ground. Alex told the inquest: 'I replied ‘roger that, see you at ground level’. We waited for them to land and tried to estimate their landing place. 'We drove past the accident site thinking it was a car crash after New Year’s Eve. He said a call was received from a friend saying there had been a balloon accident at Midsomer Norton and aware that no one else was flying in the area Alex drove back to the site. Shocking scene: Both men sustained horrific injuries in the accident with tree surgeon Mr Pibworth, a father-of-one, dying instantly from chest injuries. Giving evidence witnesses said the balloon resembled an 'upside down umbrella' as it sped to the ground. Tessa Hawtin, who lives just 150 yards from where the balloon landed said: 'There was a horrific noise, we were aware of it for two to three minutes before we actually saw the balloon. 'This balloon appeared out of the sky and instantly I knew it was wrong, it should not look like that. I just stood and watched. I felt so helpless. 'I was aware of somebody on the balloon, he was operating the burners. 'We watched the balloon for several minutes, it felt like a lifetime but it was probably two to three minutes. 'It went quiet and we realised the balloon had come to land.' Brave: Mr Pibworth wanted to gain the 19,700ft ascent standard necessary to earn a British Balloon and Airship Club gold medal. She told the inquest she first heard a 'ripping' noise at around 9.30am on the morning of the accident. Alex said his dad, an experienced mountaineer, was simply a passenger on theflight while experienced Mr Pibworth was pilot. He said both men were well prepared for their challenged and had planned for the -30 degrees Celsius temperatures and low oxygen at such a high altitude. Wing Commander Graham Maidrent, a pathologist, told the inquest both men could not have survived the incident. Mr Burnett suffered fractures to his legs, ribs and bleeding to his brain - but was alive when the blaze began. The pathologist said: 'The presence of soot in the trachea indicates that he was breathing during exposure to the fire.' He said Mr Burnett died from 'the effects of fire' and 'multiple injuries'. Mr Pibworth suffered fractures to his right arm, thigh, lumber spine, pelvis, sternum, a ruptured heart and lacerations to his liver. His death was caused by 'chest injuries'. Both men were identified by dental records. The inquest continues. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001), often referred to as \\"The Don\\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. In 1930-31, against the first West Indian side to visit Australia, Bradman's scoring was more sedate than in England--although he did make 223 in 297 minutes in the Third Test at Brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in the following Test at Melbourne. However, he scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against the South Africans in the Australian summer of 1931-32. For NSW against the tourists, he made 30, 135 and 219. In the Test matches, he scored 226 (277 minutes), 112 (155 minutes), 2 and 167 (183 minutes); his 299 not out in the Fourth Test, at Adelaide, set a new record for the highest score in a Test in Australia. Australia won nine of the ten Tests played over the two series.  At this point, Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930, scoring 2,227 runs at an average of 131. He had played 18 innings, scoring 10 centuries, six of which had extended beyond 200. His overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour, with 856 (or 38.5% of his tally) scored in boundaries. Significantly, he had not hit a six, which typified Bradman's attitude: if he hit the ball along the ground, then it could not be caught. During this phase of his career, his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a \\"machine-like\\" approach to batting. The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as, \\"heart-breaking ... with his sort of cynical grin, which rather reminds one of the Sphinx ... he never seems to perspire\\".  Between these two seasons, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according to the rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.  Bradman's chaotic wedding to Jessie Menzies in April 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into his private life. The church \\"was under siege all throughout the day ... uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view\\"; police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat. Just weeks later, Bradman joined a private team organised by Arthur Mailey to tour the United States and Canada. He travelled with his wife, and the couple treated the trip as a honeymoon. Playing 51 games in 75 days, Bradman scored 3,779 runs at 102.1, with 18 centuries. Although the standard of play was not high, the effects of the amount of cricket Bradman had played in the three previous years, together with the strains of his celebrity status, began to show on his return home.  Bradman joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more recruits than it could equip and train and Bradman spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.  Invalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.  In June 1945, Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.  However, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket.  After his return to Australia, Bradman played in his own Testimonial match at Melbourne, scoring his 117th and last century, and receiving PS9,342 in proceeds. In the 1949 New Year Honours, he was appointed Knight Bachelor for his services to the game, becoming the only Australian cricketer ever to be knighted. He commented that he \\"would have preferred to remain just Mister\\". The following year he published a memoir, Farewell to Cricket. Bradman accepted offers from the Daily Mail to travel with, and write about, the 1953 and 1956 Australian teams in England. The Art of Cricket, his final book published in 1958, is an instructional manual.  Bradman retired from his stockbroking business in June 1954, depending on the \\"comfortable\\" income earned as a board member of 16 publicly listed companies. His highest profile affiliation was with Argo Investments Limited, where he was chairman for a number of years. Charles Williams commented that, \\"[b]usiness was excluded on medical grounds, [so] the only sensible alternative was a career in the administration of the game which he loved and to which he had given most of his active life\\".  Bradman was honoured at a number of cricket grounds, notably when his portrait was hung in the Long Room at Lord's; until Shane Warne's portrait was added in 2005, Bradman was one of just three Australians to be honoured in this way. Bradman inaugurated a \\"Bradman Stand\\" at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 1974; the Adelaide Oval also opened a Bradman Stand in 1990, which housed new media and corporate facilities. The Oval's Bradman Stand was demolished in 2013 as the stadium underwent an extensive re-development. Later in 1974, he attended a Lord's Taverners function in London where he experienced heart problems, which forced him to limit his public appearances to select occasions only. With his wife, Bradman returned to Bowral in 1976, where the new cricket ground was named in his honour. He gave the keynote speech at the historic Centenary Test at Melbourne in 1977.  On 16 June 1979, the Australian government awarded Bradman the nation's second-highest civilian honour at that time, Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), \\"in recognition of service to the sport of cricket and cricket administration\\". In 1980, he resigned from the ACB, to lead a more secluded life. What did he do while in the US?","output":"While in the United States, Sir Donald Bradman was part of a private cricket team organized by Arthur Mailey. He played 51 games in 75 days during the tour of the United States and Canada. Bradman scored 3,779 runs at an average of 102.1, with 18 centuries. Although the standard of play during the tour was not very high, it provided Bradman and his wife, Jessie Menzies, with an opportunity to treat the trip as their honeymoon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? what kind of bombs were used in boston?","output":"The bombs that were used during the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013 were classified as pressure cooker bombs. To elaborate on both the type of bombs used and the incident itself: Boston Marathon Bombing: This horrific incident happened during the Boston Marathon on Patriots' Day, April 15, 2013. Two explosively formed devices were detonated near the finish line, causing three deaths and approximately 264 injuries, making it one of the most significant terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11. Pressure Cooker Bombs: These types of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were used in the catastrophic incident. A pressure cooker bomb is made up of a simple but destructive device crafted from everyday kitchen equipment and explosives. It gains its power from the energy trapped in a pressure cooker. When the bomb detonates, it releases this energy in a rapid and violent manner. Construction of the Bombs: The bombs used in the Boston Marathon bombing were fashioned out of 6-liter pressure cookers filled with gunpowder, nails, and ball bearings. Investigators found remnants of these distinct materials at the scene. The purpose of these added components was to ensure the bomb would cause the maximum amount of damage possible, with a specific intent of inflicting harm upon people located within the immediate vicinity of the bomb's blast radius. Detonation Method: The bombs were believed to have been triggered using a remote control device, like those used for toy cars. The bomb maker filled a pressure cooker with explosives and shrapnel, then sealed it. The pressure would build up upon detonation, turning the pressure cooker into a makeshift but incredibly lethal fragmentation bomb.  In essence, the bombs used during the Boston Marathon bombings were pressure cooker bombs filled with shrapnel, designed to inflict maximum damage upon detonation. These were amateur but significantly deadly devices that resulted in wide-scale tragedy. This incident marked a notorious application of pressure cooker bombs, an easily constructed yet harmful explosive device."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the navigator for whose medical lapses Ambler felt the probable cause was syphilis?  In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\", the second of MGM's Tarzan pictures, picks up a year after the events of \\"Tarzan the Ape Man\\". Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle, and Harry Holt (one of the expeditioners in the first film) returns, this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable Martin Arlington, in quest of the ivory from the elephants' graveyard. Naturally, a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way. The first film romanticized everything--the jungle, adventure, romance itself, wild animals, and even death. The second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences, but a more serious tone underlies the action. The characters dare to ask questions like: What if something happened to Tarzan? What would Jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself? While these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation, it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn't always as much fun as the throw-caution-to-the-wind attitude of the original. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane's relationship. Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate. Additionally, their love for each other has really blossomed, and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle. Most people consider \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" superior to the original \\"Tarzan the Ape Man\\". Personally, I liked the first film just a little bit better. The main reason is that the relationship between the Harry Holt & Martin Arlington team isn't nearly as likable as Holt's relationship with James Parker (Jane's father) from the original. The Mr. Arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain, but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie. The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him. (Also, I don't want to give anything away, but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him, Jane never finds out about those events, so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been.) All of these detractors are relatively minor, however, and it's still a great movie. Like the first film, \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" has amazing action scenes, wonderful wildlife footage, and one of the screen's all-time greatest romances. If you liked the first film in the series, this is definitely a sequel to see. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review seems mostly positive. The reviewer praises the growth in Tarzan and Jane's relationship, the action scenes, and the romantic aspect of the film. They also mention that most people consider \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" superior to the original.

Napoléon Bonaparte (/nəˈpoʊliən, -ˈpoʊljən/; French: [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt], born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany.

The concept of the future, and the Korda an Co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film. The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: On which planet is the weather more diverse? Context: Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets. Answer:","output":"The weather is more diverse on the planet Neptune.  Step 1: Read the user's query. The user wants to know which planet, Neptune or Uranus, has more diverse weather.  Step 2: Go through the given context. I need to find information that will allow me to answer the user's question accurately. Step 3: After reading, I notice that the context starts off by stating that Neptune has more varied weather when compared to Uranus. It further explains the details of Neptune's weather, including temperature ranges and unknown heat sources. Step 4: From this data, it's clear that Neptune's weather conditions are distinguished by their variety. It involves its increased internal heating, which drives the wind speed, and the complexity created from unknown heat sources.  Step 5: Thus, combining this information, it can be concluded from the context that Neptune's weather is described as being more diverse when compared to Uranus. This directly answers the user's question. Hence, I write the answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The 24-year-old waiter was so smart that I knew there had to be more to his story. It turns out that he won a regional yo-yo competition last year. He also gives free lessons to kids. \\"It gives them something to do,\\" Jumario said. \\"Keeps them off the streets.\\" One of the great things about eating out is the table talk with strangers, which reminds us that everyone has a life and a name. But the other day I heard that some restaurants are ending this talk between diners and servers. I listened to the reporter describe how their improvements are allowing customers to text orders from their tables to speed up service. The reporter got my attention with this sentence: \\"Five minutes after typing 'I'm at table 3', a meal arrives at the table.\\" But there wasn't a \\"please\\" with this order, which should have been a request, by the way. If you've ever waited on tables, you know that the last thing you need is yet another way for a customer to be unpleasant. Most servers are constantly mediating  between customers' requests for substitutions and overworked cooks' accusations of treason.

Summarize this article: On Friday the Court of Appeal ruled Labour was within its rights to stop some new members voting in the contest between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith. It overturned an earlier High Court ruling that the ban was unlawful. The five members said they would not take their case to the Supreme Court. The National Executive Committee (NEC), the body that governs the Labour Party, ruled that full members could only vote if they had at least six months' continuous membership by 12 July. The party offered a window from 18-20 July when more recent members - and non-members - could pay £25 to become \\"registered supporters\\" and gain the right to vote. The exclusion of the new members is thought to benefit Mr Smith. The five who challenged the NEC's ruling - Christine Evangelou, Rev Edward Leir, Hannah Fordham, Chris Granger and \\"FM\\", a teenage member - have raised £93,572 in donations but said they could not afford to take the case further. In a message posted on their crowdfunding website, Ms Fordham said: \\"But the case wasn't in vain - although we didn't succeed in reclaiming votes for the 130,000 disenfranchised members, we did win in the High Court, exposing facts which have spurred important conversations about the role of the Labour Party membership and the NEC.\\" She added that the money raised would cover their legal fees and the £30,000 in costs they had been ordered to pay to the NEC, which brought the challenge against the High Court ruling. The campaign team of party leader Mr Corbyn praised the efforts of the five members who initially brought the case to court. A Jeremy for Labour spokesman said: \\"The strength of solidarity shown to the five claimants campaigning for the democratic rights of their fellow Labour party members has been truly remarkable. \\"It is clear that there exists a huge amount of support for Jeremy's vision of a democratic Labour Party that is open and inclusive for all, so that we can achieve a Labour Government that can transform and rebuild Britain so that nowhere and no-one is left behind.\\" Speaking before the five members dropped their case, in an interview with the Observer, Mr Corbyn refused to express full confidence in the party's general secretary, Ian McNichol, who was a key figure in the NEC's appeal. Asked twice if he had full confidence in Mr McNicol, Mr Corbyn repeatedly stated: \\"I have been happy to work with Iain McNicol since I became leader.\\" The Supreme Court said it would have cost about £1,000 for the case to be heard. Ms Fordham had said it would cost about £8,000 \\"for getting the case even heard\\", but it was not clear if she was also referring to lawyers' fees.","output":"The Court of Appeal said it was okay for the Labour Party in the United Kingdom to not let some new members vote in a big contest between two people, Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith. Before, another court said it was not okay, but now that has changed. The Labour Party didn't want new members to vote because they had to be part of the party for at least six months.

The correct translation in Czech would be: \\"Byli jste zaplaceni v posledních 14 dnech?\\"  This translation is justified as follows: - \\"Have you been\\" is translated as \\"Byli jste\\". In Czech, the verb typically comes first in interrogative sentences, so this order of words is correct. - \\"paid\\" is translated as \\"zaplaceni\\". This is the past participle of the verb \\"to pay\\", and as such, it's the right form to use in this phrase. - \\"in the last\\" is translated as \\"v posledních\\". This phrase is used to signify something that has happened within a certain period of time up to now.  - \\"14 days\\" is translated as \\"14 dnech\\".

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres.

Plot title: S1m0ne Movie plot: When Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder), the star of out-of-favor director Viktor Taransky's (Al Pacino) new film, refuses to finish it, Taransky is forced to find a replacement. Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot. Instead, Viktor experiments with a new computer program he inherits from late acquaintance Hank Aleno (Elias Koteas) which allows creation of a computer-generated woman which he can easily animate to play the film's central character. Viktor names his virtual actor \\"Simone\\", a name derived from the computer program's title, Simulation One. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone (Rachel Roberts) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Viktor. The film is immediately a huge success. The studio, and soon the world, ask \\"who is Simone?\\" Viktor initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that only intensifies media demands for her to appear. Viktor intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology. Eventually it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews. In one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Viktor used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed and blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance. He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in person is reinforced with realtime visualization on the stadium's monitors.

Im Zusammenhang mit der Suche nach vielversprechenden Technologien für eine post-karbon Energieversorgung zeigt sich dieser Mangel an Effektivität besonders deutlich.

There he didn't see any valley glacier.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   If Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, which mountain should he visit, Alps or ural?  Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: David Shacklefield was allowed to keep his licence despite ignoring a red light. A white van man has been allowed to keep his driving licence despite racing over a level crossing after the traffic lights had turned red. David Shackleford claims he did not have enough time to stop the vehicle after realising the lights had changed at the crossing in Foxton, Cambridgeshire, so decided it would be safer to speed over the tracks. The 28-year-old trainee truck driver was moments away from colliding with a train, but has been allowed to keep his licence after pleading with magistrates. The driver from Harrow, north west London, was fined £200 and given three points for the incident on January 15. After initially claiming he the lights were on amber, the driver admitted he ignored them after being sent images taken from CCTV footage which clearly show him in plain view of the red light. But Judge Ken Sheraton decided not to disqualify Shackleford, as it would put him out of work. 'I was driving at 40mph and it would have been unsafe for me to slam the breaks on. 'By the time the lights came into view it would have been silly for me to stop.' It is not the first time drivers have had a near miss with oncoming trains at the crossing in Cambridgeshire. In 2010 John McDonald, 38, ignored the flashing warning lights and accelerated his 44-tonne sewage truck over the crossing. The driver was filmed approaching the crossing while the lights are red despite claiming they were amber. Shacklefield accelerated over the train lines just moments before a train thundered by at the crossing in Cambridgeshire. The automatic barriers smashed as they crashed on top of the artic. Two years later Belal Ahmed, 32, was convicted of speeding under the dropping barriers in the BMW, and ten days after that Girish Babu, 31, stopped his Mercedes on the crossing, forcing the signalman to stop the barriers in mid-air. Sgt Andy Cook of British Transport Police said: 'Misusing level crossings is extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated by BTP. 'Drivers who ignore the warning lights and barriers don’t just risk their own lives, but also endanger other road users and rail passengers and staff.' Highlights:","output":"A man named David Shacklefield drove over a level crossing after the traffic light turned red. He said he didn't have enough time to stop his van, so he sped over the train tracks. He was very close to hitting a train. The judge allowed him to keep his driving license, but he was fined £200 and given three points for not stopping at the red light. This has happened at the same place in the past with other drivers. It is very dangerous to drive over a level crossing when the lights are red, as it can put many people's lives at risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that Nifty offers a lead on a manager's job? ?  When Johnny Quinlan loses his job in a drug store, he is afraid to tell his wife, Bertha, and therefore keeps up the pretense of leaving each morning for a non-existent job, as he begins the search for a new job. As the days pass and he is unable to find employment, their household, which includes his sister, Lottie, and Bertha's brother, Dan Walsh, goes through what little savings they have. As he gets more desperate, he agrees to do small jobs for \\"Nifty\\" Herman, a small-time gangster.  Nifty had loaned Johnny 15, as part of a plan to entice him to work for him.  After Johnny gets insulted by a common laborer job offer from a neighbor, Nifty lies to him and says that he has a friend who will get him a managerial position at a liquor store.  All Johnny has to do is hold onto a case of high-priced alcohol for a few days.  Dubious, Johnny reluctantly agrees and takes the suitcase back to his apartment.  However, when Bertha finds out who he got the suitcase from, she demands that he return it, threatening to leave him if he doesn't. Taking the case back to Nifty, he finds the office locked, and so returns home.  When he arrives, his sister's suitor, Charles Newton, is visiting.  Newton is a government agent.  Even though Johnny tries to hide the case, his efforts are futile, and Newton spies it and becomes suspicious, seeing a resemblance to a case he and his men have been attempting to track down.  Opening it, he discovers it contains a cache of drugs.  When he interrogates Johnny, he gets the whole story, and is about to arrest Johnny, when Nifty arrives to retrieve the suitcase.  Johnny tricks Nifty into confessing, and then subdues him, when he is resisting the efforts of Newton and his deputies to arrest him.  The film ends with Johnny being rewarded for the way he handled himself by becoming Newton's assistant.

Movie title: Fortress Movie plot: The film starts with an explanation of the B-17s, the MTO campaign and a plan to strike Rome on July 19, 1943. It then follows the story of the B-17F \\"Lucky Lass\\" and her Irish-American crew, Philly (Bombardier), Archie (Navigator), Pops (Pilot), Wally (Co-pilot), Burt (Top Turret gunner/Engineer), Charlie (Radio Operator), Al (Ball turret gunner), Jake and Joe (waist gunners) and Eddie (Tail gunner). During a raid on Gerbini, Italy, Pops, Jake and Joe are killed and the plane is heavily damaged. 5 days later, the rest of the crew meet the replacements, Michael, Tom and Oliver, co-pilot and waist gunners, respectively. They then pressure the crew chief, Caparelli, to clear their plane to fly (which he does) and they throw a party to celebrate, during which they find out Michael doesn't drink, upsetting everybody but Wally, now pilot, who gives him advice on running the crew. During the next mission, Wally gets ptomaine from native food and asks Mike to fly. However, he doesn't fly by the instruments, getting lost and they have to, fight off Me-109s, surviving with the help of friendly P-40 fighters. The Lass is forced to abort and land at the base. There is a sandstorm that night, which leads Burt to leave the alcohol still he put together from bomber parts, to make moonshine from the ethanol laced aviation fuel, open, leaking alcohol. They are forced to abort yet another 'milk run' (an easy mission) because of engine failure and the crew blame Mike, who starts drinking. Caparelli, after making a check, says there's nothing mechanically wrong with the plane and Burt's still explodes. Meanwhile, the aircraft that continued on mission begin to arrive back, with signs of heavy damage, indicating that it had not been easy as was thought. Wally convinces Mike that by aborting the mission, he had partly saved them. The crews are mixed for the next mission, while Charlie, Eddie and Michael are not assigned.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"Fortress,\\" the character named Abraham is not mentioned in the plot provided. Therefore, it is impossible for me to answer the question, \\"How does Abraham die?\\" since we do not have any information about this character. However, I can provide some guidance on whether you should invest in this film proposal based on the plot outlined. The movie seems to be a historical war film with a focus on the B-17 bomber crew during World War II. It has a somewhat complex plot that involves various challenges faced by the aircrew and the interpersonal relationships among them. The movie appears to be a mix of action, drama, and tragedy, with several characters being killed during the course of the narrative. When considering investment in a film, key factors to consider include the target audience, genre popularity, and potential for critical and commercial success. War films tend to have a relatively niche audience, with an interest in historical events and military themes, which may limit its commercial potential. However, the success of films such as \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"Dunkirk,\\" and \\"1917\\" demonstrates that there can be a significant market for well-made, engaging war films. Moreover, the quality of the script, the strength of the director, and the cast can greatly influence a film's success. High-quality production values, a strong cast, and a solid marketing campaign can help mitigate the risks associated with investing in a niche genre. To make an informed decision about investing in the \\"Fortress,\\" it is crucial to familiarize yourself with other factors, such as the estimated production budget, financing structure, distribution strategy, and the creative team's track record. It would also be helpful to read the full screenplay and meet with the production team and cast, if possible, to assess their commitment to the project. Ultimately, while the provided plot summary may pique your interest, further research and direct involvement in the project will be decisive in deciding whether it is a worthwhile investment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a new situation: Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health.  But I can use this background: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.  What is an answer for this question: Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim?","output":"Based on the information provided, Dan, the normal patient, had a normal number of red blood cells. Jim, the patient with sickle-cell anemia, may have a different number of red blood cells due to his condition.

Answer the following question: Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids.  Which scientist read more about dairying ants milking the aphids?  Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is clear that Pam is the scientist who read more about dairying ants milking the aphids. This is because Pam is studying ants that farm aphids, which are the type of ants that engage in a mutualistic relationship with the aphids, consuming the honeydew they produce. In this relationship, the dairying ants milk the aphids by stroking them with their antennae, which is the exact behavior described in the question. While Ellie is also studying ants, her focus is specifically on leafcutter ants, which have a distinct behavior and ecological role compared to the dairying ants Pam is studying. Leafcutter ants, rather than engaging in mutualistic relationships with aphids, are known for their unique behavior of cutting and collecting leaf fragments to cultivate a fungus garden within their colonies, which they eventually consume as a food source. Therefore, Pam is the scientist that read more about dairying ants milking the aphids as her research subject is directly related to the ants that farm aphids and engage in the mutualistic relationship with them. On the other hand, Ellie's research on leafcutter ants focuses on a different type of ant species with a unique ecological role and behavior unrelated to milking aphids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Chris Christie Is Still More Popular Than Governors Who Were Literally Criminals But nearly no one else.      New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie seems to be taking the Thelma and Louise route out of office. Except instead of throwing a car off a cliff, Christie is taking New Jersey residents for a ride.      Over the weekend, the New Jersey government was shut down because of a budget impasse and Christie got caught on camera sunbathing at a public beach that was closed by that shutdown. His job approval rating was already just 15 percent, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. Which makes me wonder: Is Christie trying to be the most unpopular governor in recorded history?      He’s not there yet. Based on my analysis of every governor’s lowest poll since 1958, Christie currently ranks fourth on the list of most unpopular governors in the modern era.      Chris Christie is one of the most unpopular governors ever Percentage of a state’s residents or voters who approved of the job the governor was doing, according to the lowest poll during his tenure YEAR GOVERNOR STATE POLLSTER APPROVE/FAVORABLE 2005 Bob Taft Ohio Zogby Interactive 7% 2008 Rod Blagojevich Illinois Glengariff Group 8 2006 Frank Murkowski Alaska SurveyUSA 14 2017 Chris Christie New Jersey Quinnipiac U. 15 1990 Edward DiPrete Rhode Island Brown U. 16 Includes approval and favorability polls.      (There isn’t a complete data archive of governors’ approval ratings, as there is for presidential approval. The list I used was based on one put together by political scientists Richard Niemi, Thad Beyle and Lee Sigelman, which was current through 2010. I’ve added to it since then when there have been governors who have been plagued by scandal or faced particularly low ratings for other reasons. If you see someone missing on this list send me an email.)      My guess is that Christie probably isn’t going to be the most unpopular governor ever. To do so, he’d need his approval rating to drop my more than half. Single-digit approval ratings are generally reserved for those who were charged or convicted of a crime while in office.      In 2005, Ohio’s governor, Bob Taft, was convicted of misdemeanor ethics charges after failing to report gifts including free golf outings. Taft hit a 7 percent favorable rating in a Zogby Interactive poll that year. Taft’s low approval rating helped contribute to a Democratic wave in Ohio during the 2006 midterm elections.      You might also remember convicted felon and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. His 8 percent approval rating in a Glengariff Group poll came in the midst of his pay-for-play scandal, in which he tried to sell Barack Obama’s Senate seat after Obama ascended to the presidency. Blagojevich was removed from office by the Illinois state legislature, went on to lose on the Celebrity Apprentice and was sent to prison for trying to sell the Senate seat, among other corruption charges.      Christie might have a better shot at becoming the third least-popular governor. He is just one point behind former Alaska Gov. Frank Murkowski. Murkowski was unpopular in large part because he appointed his own daughter Lisa to his seat upon becoming governor in 2003. That move angered Alaskans and led to him coming in third behind former Wasilla mayor Sarah Palin in his own party’s primary for governor in 2006.      The bottom line is that Christie is in very undistinguished company. Christie is disliked by Democrats and Republicans alike. And that dislike has made it very likely that New Jersey will have a Democratic governor come next year. ||||| This wasn’t how he figured it would end. A year after being steamrolled by Donald Trump, Chris Christie is hobbling out of office as the most unpopular governor in the history of New Jersey—a casualty of scandal and hubris, and a guy freed up to quietly pursue the toughest job of his life.      You'd think that by now, Chris Christie would be impervious to insults—that today, as his eight roller-coaster years as New Jersey's governor come to a humbling close, he might be able to let certain things slide. But before I'd even set one foot into his office on a recent afternoon, there was a bone he wanted to pick. Sitting at a long table, Christie waved his iPhone, on which he'd pulled up a 2015 article from GQ’s website, a profile of sorts that probed his famed peevishness. He read the headline to me: “‘What a Dick: The Chris Christie Story.’” Then, the story's subject fixed me in his gaze. “So you can see why I kind of thought that maybe this”—he gestured toward the empty chair waiting for me—“may not be the best thing for me.”      Christie nonetheless motioned for me to sit. It was the end of a long week, at the end of a long summer, which had come on the heels of a long couple of years, and he was in an unusually reflective mood. There were things he wanted to say—about all that he'd been through, all the ways he'd been misunderstood, and all that he hoped still to accomplish—and his wariness soon gave way to candor. Even on the subject of his most recent political wound.      No doubt, you remember the viral pictures from July: Christie lounging on the Jersey Shore, plopped shamelessly on a beach otherwise emptied by a government shutdown. The photos—snapped from a rented airplane—prompted a brutal national roasting. Here was Christie, closing New Jersey's beaches to wage political war, yet basking in the surf himself.      But what if I told you that his decision to spend the Fourth of July weekend on the sands of Island Beach State Park was made with goodness in his heart? Could you be convinced that the whole kerfuffle came about because Christie was trying to ease the suffering of opioid addicts?      “He was a force of nature,” Christie says of Donald Trump. “[He] ran the race in terms of the outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is guy. That was my lane.”      Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch. Christie had decided long before the shutdown that he wasn't altering his planned trip to the beach—and he's not about to apologize for it now. “If there was a 25-year-old blonde in that beach chair next to me, then you got a story,” Christie said. “But my wife of 31 years and all my kids?! I never thought it was that big a deal.”      But what people overlooked, he went on, is that his decision to engage in the political brinkmanship that led to the closing of the state government—the thing that made his presence on the beach that day so objectionable—was downright noble. “The shutdown,” as he recounted for me, “was about opioids.”      For much of his governorship, Christie had been admirably proactive in (and progressive about) addressing the drug scourge—bucking his fellow Republicans to expand Medicaid, which made drug treatment more available to poor people in New Jersey; pushing for more drug courts, which steer nonviolent offenders toward treatment instead of prison; even signing a “Good Samaritan” law that provides immunity from arrest for people who call 911 if they’re with someone who overdoses. But now, in his final year in office, Christie had made the opioid problem an even greater priority—his top one, in fact.      The centerpiece of the effort was to be 300 million in new funding for addiction treatment, the financing of which led to a showdown with state legislators and the resulting mid-summer shutdown. In classic bare-knuckled Christie fashion, he had hoped to use the shutdown to embarrass his rival, Vinnie Prieto, the Democratic Speaker of the General Assembly, by hanging 500 posters on shuttered government offices across the state that featured Prieto’s picture and read: “This facility is closed because of this man.” But whatever leverage Christie thought he had went out the window when his own photos, those of his beach vacation, emerged. Three days into the shutdown, Christie agreed to a budget deal that, crucially, did not include his 300 million for opioids.      Nonetheless, that hasn't stopped him from spinning the budget deal as a victory—boasting to me about how he'd brought to heel the state's largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, from which he'd hoped to extract his cash. “We wound up getting a bunch of reforms,” he said. I reminded him that he didn't get the money for opioids. “I'll get what I want, don't worry,” he told me. “I know I will.”      And yet Christie's trademark bluster was belied by his surroundings. It was a Friday afternoon, and Trenton—decades removed from those bustling days when the city, as the famous slogan puts it, did the making and the world did the taking—was even sleepier than usual. The legislature was out of session, and since the historical State House building, which was built when George Washington was president, was undergoing extensive renovations, Christie was working out of a temporary space in a drab, ahistoric state office building, where he'll stay until his term ends in January. He'd decorated it with photos and reminders of his favorite things—Springsteen, Reagan, the Mets—but he couldn't deny that it lacked the grandeur of his old digs. “You know, you sit in the space where Woodrow Wilson sat,” he mused. Unmentioned by the governor, of course, was that he once envisioned himself sitting in another, loftier office held by Wilson. If a man of Christie's size can seem small, he suddenly did.      But while Christie may have been diminished, he was not necessarily defeated. In the issue of opioids, he seemed to have found a new, and most likely final, purpose as a public official—his last, best shot to do something big and good, something that could fulfill the outsize ambitions that so many people, not least among them Chris Christie, had placed in him. Not only was he working on fighting opioids in New Jersey; he was also chairing a presidential commission for Donald Trump to develop a national strategy on the issue. “This opioid issue, to me, is the single most important issue that I have left to deal with,” Christie told me.      I asked him how he planned to get the 300 million for his New Jersey efforts. “Stay tuned,” Christie said. “I'm not gonna tell you now. Stay tuned.” He sat up straighter in his chair and, summoning his old swagger, went on. “We will spend and invest a significant amount of money, very close to what I was asking for, if not exactly what I was asking for, on this issue, because it is non-negotiable to me,” Christie said. “If I don't get it from Horizon, I'll get it from someplace else, and when you're governor, in this state, you have the ability to get that done.” It wasn't clear if he was trying to convince himself or me.      A few weeks later, it didn't matter. He announced that he was going to spend 200 million on opioid treatment—a significant sum, no doubt, but still only two-thirds of what he'd originally wanted.      These are the final days of Chris Christie, who has experienced the most vertiginous rise and precipitous fall of any American politician this century. Although he's loath to second-guess past actions and decisions, much less admit to mistakes—“He always used to say that one of the first rules of leadership is to tear off the rearview mirror, because you can't change what happened,” says one Christie confidant—he has a difficult time resisting nostalgia.      Showing me around his temporary digs, his tie loosened and his suit jacket draped over the back of a chair, Christie relived his glory days. “That was when Obama came during '13 to the one-year anniversary [of Superstorm Sandy],” Christie said, pointing to a picture of himself and the former president. It was on that occasion—a year after the two rivals made headlines for being chummy—that Christie bested Obama in a boardwalk football toss. “That was really good,” Christie went on. “I've spoken to the former president a few times, and whenever I do, I get a chance to lord it over him.”      Though he came to the governor's office eight years ago as a relative nobody—eking out an unimpressive victory against a feeble opponent—Christie was a gust of fresh political air and almost instantly became a star. He filled the position in such an unexpected and exceptional manner—battling public employees' unions one moment and Islamophobes the next—that Republican heavyweights like Henry Kissinger were soon begging him to run for the White House against Barack Obama. Christie demurred, saying that he didn't think he was ready yet to be president, but there was no doubt that, with a little more time, he'd come to a different conclusion. He steered his state through the trauma of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and a year later was re-elected with an unheard-of 60 percent of the vote. On magazine covers and in smoke-filled back rooms, it was a foregone conclusion that he'd be the Republican presidential nominee in 2016.      Then came Bridgegate, the scandal that resulted from his allies' efforts to punish a New Jersey mayor who didn't endorse his re-election campaign by blocking traffic on the George Washington Bridge. Although two of those allies would ultimately be given prison sentences—they're currently appealing their convictions—Christie pleaded ignorance (and innocence) and clawed back enough to run for the White House in 2016. That's when he became roadkill to Donald Trump.      “He gets mad at me at times, he yells at me at times, but he respects me,” Christie says of his relationship with Donald Trump.      Of course, Christie was hardly alone in getting steamrolled by Trump, who bested 15 other Republicans, not to mention Hillary Clinton, on his way to the White House. But Christie's defeat was particularly humbling, since it involved Trump doing to him what Christie was accustomed to doing to others. Christie's rise, after all, had been fueled by his bullying and belittling of friends and foes alike—telling a protester at a press conference to “sit down and shut up” or his constituents to “get the hell off the beach” during a hurricane. In many ways, Christie seemed perfectly matched to the political moment of 2016: a no-holds-barred truth-teller who wasn't afraid to offend people's delicate sensibilities.      It's just that Trump did him one better. Christie might have scored points against Marco Rubio during a debate by ridiculing him for his “memorized 30-second speech,” but it was Trump who indelibly—and offensively—branded the Florida senator as Liddle Marco…and Jeb Bush as Low-Energy Jeb…and Ted Cruz as Lyin' Ted. Christie was like a drive-time deejay trying to compete with Howard Stern.      “He was a force of nature at a political time when people wanted to hear the way he was saying things,” Christie now says of Trump. “There's a marked difference between the way we approach these things, no doubt. But I think it made me look less candid.” He adds, almost plaintively: “Donald Trump ran the race in terms of the outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is guy. That was my lane.”      Even worse for Christie, once he ended his presidential campaign, his humiliations at Trump's hands continued. Unlike most of the candidates whom Trump had vanquished, Christie, upon exiting the race, almost immediately endorsed him. It seemed an odd move. Not only had Trump once alleged that Christie “totally knew about” Bridgegate—a charge that Christie particularly resents; Christie had attacked Trump as “an entertainer” and unserious. What's more, Christie had fashioned himself as a different kind of Republican, one who could appeal to non-white voters. (In his 2013 re-election, Christie won 51 percent of Latino voters and 21 percent of African-Americans.) It was hard to see how he could support someone who'd accused Mexico of sending “rapists” to the U.S. and only reluctantly disavowed the support of David Duke.      It was even stranger to see Christie so slavishly playing second fiddle—appearing behind Trump at rallies while Trump prattled on, wearing what CNN called a “hostage face”—especially when Trump didn't stop needling Christie. In one instance, Trump appeared to make fun of Christie's weight, telling him that he could no longer eat Oreos; in another, Trump held an umbrella above his own head while Christie, standing right next to him, got wet in the rain. And yet Christie continued to stand, mutely, by Trump's side. “I'd never seen him be so deferential,” Tom Kean, a former New Jersey governor and Christie's political mentor, says. “But it's a normal reaction to be deferential to someone you wanted a job from.”      But the job never came. First, Trump picked Mike Pence over Christie for his running mate. Then, after Trump won in November, he chose Jeff Sessions over Christie for attorney general. Adding insult to injury, Trump fired Christie as the chairman of his transition team—the consolation prize Christie had been given when he was passed over in the veepstakes.      Christie insists that he and Trump have no problems with each other—that, in fact, they've been friends for years—and it's obviously important to him that people know he views himself and the businessman turned president as peers. Christie's former law partner and longtime political consigliere, Bill Palatucci, emphasizes that when Trump and Christie first met in 2002, Christie said hello as a favor to Trump's sister, a federal judge whose jurisdiction includes New Jersey. “I think it's crucial to understanding the relationship,” Palatucci says. “To meet Trump on such a level playing field means a lot, and they've always seen themselves as equals.” Christie says of Trump: “He gets mad at me at times, he yells at me at times, but he respects me.” Christie adds that he often yells back at Trump, although “less now that he's president.”      Indeed, it's conventional wisdom among political insiders that Christie's problem isn't so much with Trump as it is with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose father Christie sent to prison when Christie was a federal prosecutor. Even on that score, Christie downplays any friction. “There's a lot of history there, not between me and him but between me and his father,” Christie says, “and Jared has continued to tell me that he holds no grudge against me, so I have to take him at his word.” As for who has torpedoed him repeatedly in TrumpWorld, Christie is as philosophical as he is fatalistic. “When you're as prominent a person as I've been, there's more than one person shooting at you all the time,” he says. “So unless you see it, you don't necessarily know which bullet hit you.”      It’s an attitude he’s trying to get others who are close to him to adopt—like his four children who, Christie says, haven’t responded as philosophically as he has to his recent setbacks. “They were really angry,” Christie told me. “And I just said to all of them, it’s like the old Hyman Roth line from The Godfather. ‘This is the business we have chosen.’ And it’s not fair, but you’ve gotta understand that in life sometimes unfair things happen.” He paused, as if to indulge in a little more self-reflection. “The bridge situation wasn’t fair to me, but, you know, things happen and you have to live with some of life’s unfairness.”      The job that Christie did ultimately get, chairing the Trump-created President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioids Crisis, has been dismissed by some as the ultimate booby prize. But Christie actually jumped at the opportunity. Indeed, according to one Trump adviser, Christie, after not getting the attorney-general assignment, ultimately passed on several other possible posts in the Trump administration—including secretary of commerce and secretary of veterans affairs, as well as ambassadorships to Italy and the Vatican. (Christie denies being offered the positions with the departments of Commerce and Veterans Affairs.) “Trump asked Jared, Reince, and Bannon to find him a job,” says the Trump adviser. “But Christie didn't want to give up being governor for what they were offering.”      Working on the opioids issue is something Christie has been interested in for years, and not only because it allowed him to keep his day job. More than two decades ago, as a newly elected New Jersey county freeholder, Christie launched a successful push to get the local government to pay for inpatient drug treatment for adolescents who couldn't afford it. “We were the first county in the state to do that,” he boasts.      A decade later, the issue became even more personal when one of his best friends from law school—who was by then a successful attorney—developed a Percocet addiction. Christie and other friends were enlisted to stage an intervention, and for the next eight years—through the man's divorce, his trips to rehab and then his relapses, the loss of his law license and his home—Christie was part of his support system. In early 2014, the man called Christie to check in. “He said he was doing really well and he wanted to show me how well, and ‘Let's go out to dinner,’ ” Christie recalls. The night they agreed to meet, the man stood Christie up. Three weeks later, Christie got the call he knew was coming: His friend had been found dead in a motel room, an empty bottle of Percocet and a drained quart of vodka on the nightstand. “His death,” Christie says, “was one of the more traumatic moments of my life.”      Christie's presidential campaign revealed to him just how widespread the opioid problem was. On his first visit to New Hampshire as a candidate, he stopped for lunch at a pizza place in Manchester. The owner told him that one of his employees had overdosed in the bathroom the day before. He learned from one of the women who did his makeup before his appearances on cable shows that she was a recovering addict. And he heard, at countless town halls, from those impacted by addiction. “I was confronted with a real sense of despair,” Christie says.      Now that he's tackling the issue for the administration of the man who described New Hampshire as a “drug-infested den”—“That wouldn't be my characterization,” Christie says—he's faced a couple of formidable challenges. For one, there was Tom Price, who until he resigned in September was the head of Trump's Department of Health and Human Services and who’d voiced skepticism about medication-assisted treatments like methadone and offered support for “faith-based” approaches. And there’s still Jeff Sessions, Trump’s attorney general and former Alabama Senator who has vowed to fight a new drug war by pushing the harshest sentences possible for even low-level drug offenders. “There are aspects of the administration who still believe this is an enforcement issue,” Christie concedes. And while he's reluctant to mention Sessions by name, it's clear that's who Christie's talking about when he says, “I do think that my emphasis based upon eight years as a governor, dealing with this on the ground, is different from the perspective you get as a United States senator.”      More than Sessions, though, there's the challenge of Trump—since the commission can only be as effective as the president lets it be. Of course, Christie's opioids commission has been one of the only Trump-administration policy initiatives to be run with a semblance of normalcy. It has held meetings featuring the testimony of well-respected experts and has solicited comments from the general public, as well. Although the commission was about a month late in submitting its interim report on July 31, the document itself was hailed for policy recommendations that accurately reflected the medical and public-health consensus on the issue.      But Trump's response to the report has been as abnormal and incompetent as everything else in his administration. Christie actually tailored the report to his boss's needs, taking the commission staff's initial draft and personally editing it down to a third of its original length. “I remember when I was doing debate prep with [Trump in the general election] and people would come in with binders that were like five or six inches thick, and I'd look at them and say, ‘That's going to be the most exquisite coaster at Mar-a-Lago,’ because he's not going to read all that stuff,” Christie told me. “That's not the way he takes in information. He's much more of a, give him a short bit of writing and then verbally talk to him. And that's what we did on the report.... I wrote the report for him. It's not like a white paper that is 80 pages that he wouldn't look at. I knew who my audience was.”      The report's “first and most urgent recommendation” was that Trump declare the opioid epidemic a “national emergency.” Trump initially seemed to reject this advice in favor of the views of Price, who on August 8, after a meeting devoted to the opioid-commission report, emerged to tell reporters that the president had concluded that the opioid crisis could be addressed “without the declaration of a national emergency.” But then two days later, Trump responded to a reporter's question after a national-security briefing at his golf club in New Jersey by declaring, “The opioid crisis is an emergency. And I'm saying officially right now, it is an emergency. It's a national emergency.” Christie told me that Trump had called him in advance to tell him he'd be making the declaration. “He wasn't ad-libbing at all,” Christie says. But Trump apparently didn't give a heads-up to the rest of his staff, because more than a month after the declaration, his administration has not followed up with any policy changes. If and when it will remains unclear—even to Christie. “I think the president is probably 90 percent of the way with me,” he says.      Ever since he was elected governor, Christie had made it something of a tradition on Memorial and Labor Day weekends to visit boardwalks on the Jersey Shore. There he'd eat ice cream and pose for selfies. On the Memorial Day weekend after Sandy, when the Shore was reopening for business, he was greeted like Charles de Gaulle during the liberation of Paris. But this past Labor Day, Christie skipped a boardwalk excursion. It could have been a routine scheduling conflict, but Christie also has good reason to want to avoid big crowds.      The truth is, the crowds haven't been very friendly to him lately. On Memorial Day last year, beachgoers along the Asbury Park boardwalk jeered him as “a fucking disgrace” for supporting Trump. At a Milwaukee Brewers baseball game in July, a heckler goaded a nachos-toting Christie into a confrontation that, filmed by another fan's phone, went viral. And at a New York Mets game later that month, when Christie's image appeared on the JumboTron after he'd caught a foul ball, he was serenaded with boos. Christie tries to brush off these encounters as unrepresentative. “I will tell you that I took hundreds of pictures in Milwaukee over a three-day weekend of people who came up and said, ‘We love you. Can I please have a picture? We think you're doing a great job,’ ” he says. “The overwhelming majority of people that I interact with are like that.” But whereas Christie seemingly used to relish confrontations, they now appear to take a toll. “When I sat back down,” he says of the testy incident in Milwaukee, “it ruined the rest of the game for me.” He adds, “I'm a public servant, not a public punching bag.”      And so perhaps that's why the closest Christie came to a public event at the Shore this past Labor Day weekend was the Wednesday before, when he appeared at a rest stop along the Garden State Parkway, just past the exit for Asbury Park. Standing behind a podium in a far corner of the parking lot—which was hardly scenic but admittedly beat the men's room or the Nathan's counter—Christie announced a plan to renovate all of the rest stops along the parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. “People who travel on both these roads, the turnpike and the parkway, will stop at places like this to get gas, they'll stop to get something to eat, they'll stop to use the facilities. And for a lot of these folks, their first impression of our state—if this is their first visit—is a rest stop on the turnpike or the parkway,” Christie said, summoning more enthusiasm than the moment seemed to warrant.      It was a far cry from the White House, or even his glory days in Trenton, which may be why Christie seemed so alone. It's typical for staff to leave lame-duck governors, but Christie has experienced an unusually heavy exodus. Some exits were prompted by Bridgegate. Others left because of Christie's endorsement of Trump. Maria Comella, his longtime communications director—“my alter ego,” Christie called her—went so far as to back Clinton during the presidential campaign, without giving Christie so much as a warning. “I was literally in Trump Tower,” Christie recalls. “Paul Manafort comes up to me and says, ‘Your communications director just endorsed Hillary Clinton?’ ” Comella now works for Andrew Cuomo.      “I know he’s not a racist,” Chris Christie says of Trump, when asked about the president’s “both sides” rhetoric after the violence in Charlottesville. “He just blew it.”      And New Jersey Republicans, who once jockeyed to align themselves with Christie, now keep their distance. His atrocious poll numbers will almost certainly deliver the governor's office to the Democratic candidate, Phil Murphy, in November. When I asked Murphy's campaign strategist, Steve DeMicco, how much of a factor Christie was in Murphy's giant lead in the polls over his Republican opponent, Christie's lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, he replied, “One hundred percent.”      Christie hasn't yet decided what he'll do once he leaves office. He flirted with a sports-talk-radio gig and even auditioned to replace Mike Francesca on New York's WFAN, but both he and the station decided to abandon the experiment. He'll likely join a law firm or an investment firm and make some serious money. It's a good bet he'll sign a contributor contract with CNN or MSNBC. He doesn't deny that he might at some point do more work for Trump, if Trump asks him, and he remains steadfast in his defense of the president. About Trump's “both sides” rhetoric after the violence in Charlottesville, Christie told me, “I know he's not a racist. He just blew it.” When I asked Christie how Trump kept blowing it if he's not a racist—repeatedly failing to criticize neo-Nazis and white supremacists—he deflected: “Don't confuse that with stubbornness. The president has a stubborn streak.”      So, of course, does Christie, but he swears he's done with elected office. “I don't see myself running for office again, because I've had the one job that I really wanted, that's governor, and I ran for the other job that I really wanted, which was president,” Christie told me.      For eight years, Christie has been a political force. Now that force seems exhausted. As the shadows grew longer that afternoon in his office, he confronted his more limited horizons. A guy once ridiculed for spending so much time away from New Jersey pursuing his national political ambitions, he now seems content to stay there—even if he does go the cable news and Wall Street route. “I'm not a Manhattan kind of guy,” Christie said. “I think we'd be much more comfortable buying a house at the Jersey Shore.”      Jason Zengerle is GQ’s political correspondent. |||||","output":"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was caught on camera sunbathing on a public beach that was closed due to a government shutdown.

After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772.

The answer to this question is:","output":"To find the answer to this question, we must determine if cell Y is undergoing a process that moves substances up or down the concentration gradient. Step 1: Understand the concept of the concentration gradient A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance between two areas.

This is a passive process, called diffusion, which does not require energy. Step 2: Analyze the behavior of cell Y In cell Y, substances are coming together and moving into close proximity to one another, which indicates that the concentration of these substances is increasing. Step 3: Determine if cell Y is moving up or down the concentration gradient Since the concentration of substances in cell Y is increasing, the molecules are moving from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. This is an active process called active transport, which requires energy. This implies that cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient. The answer to this question is: Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Stu's father has equally high hopes of rebuilding his life and the life of his family. Stu is constantly getting into fights with everyone who says a bad word about him or his sister. Especially a group of children, who Stu considers to be the lowest of the low, the Lipnicki's. Stephen, Stu's father realized what was worth fighting over and what wasn't, and so he tries to help Stu understand that he needs to pick his battles. Lidia, meanwhile, is off in the Lipnicki's junkyard, scavenging for the items they need to make the tree fort.

Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler. From 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August--Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznan) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery.  From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become \\"what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.\\"  His first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by \\"promoting\\" Hoffmann to Plock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland (1079-1138), where administrative offices were relocated from Thorn (Torun). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married \\"Mischa\\" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcinska). They moved to Plock in August 1802.  Hoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in Kotzebue's periodical, Die Freimuthige, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann's was called Der Preis (\\"The Prize\\"), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 Friedrichs d'or. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Cora Hatt in Konigsberg.  At the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at Warsaw. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Cora Hatt's daughters. He was never to return to Konigsberg.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What happened to Hoffmann in the provinces?","output":"During his time in the provinces, Hoffmann experienced a period of turmoil and upheaval in his life, as mentioned in the text: \\"From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia.

First lady Nancy Reagan makes a \\"Just Say No\\" appearance in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., on Sept. 11, 1986. (Photo: Bob Daugherty, AP)      Nancy Reagan may best be remembered for three words: \\"Just say no,\\" the motto of her years-long anti-drug crusade.      She had been concerned about drug use prior to her arrival at the White House, but as first lady she made prevention of youth drug addiction her signature cause.      She said the slogan had come from a meeting with children. The Ronald Reagan Library tells the story this way: \\"A little girl raised her hand,” Nancy Reagan recalled, “and said, ’Mrs. Reagan, what do you do if somebody offers you drugs?’ And I said, ’Well, you just say no.’ And there it was born.”      The library says that by the end of the Reagan administration in 1989, more than 12,000 \\"Just Say No\\" clubs had been formed worldwide.      Nancy Reagan worked with a New York advertising firm to shape the campaign and used popular culture to propel her message. In 1983, she played herself in an episode of the popular sitcom Diff'rent Strokes. Diminutive star Gary Coleman portrayed a reporter for the school newspaper who discovered drugs being sold on campus, and she came to the school to offer support for anti-drug efforts.      Another popular kids television show, Punky Brewster, aired an episode about resisting peer pressure to take drugs, and started a partnership with Nancy Reagan's \\"Just Say No\\" clubs organizing anti-drug \\"Punky Brewster Marches\\" at schools around the country.

In September 1987 she met one-on-one with Pope John Paul II to discuss her anti-drug efforts.      \\"Just Say No,\\" however, has also been heavily criticized as an over-simplistic approach to addressing drug abuse. Scientific American reported in 2014 that studies showed students need a much more nuanced education on social interactions and that students in \\"Just Say No\\"-style programs were as likely to use drugs as students who were not.      And drug use, particularly cocaine, soared in the 1980s, as did the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses. By the end of the decade, pollsters reported that a majority of Americans saw drug abuse as the most serious issue facing the nation.

Nancy Reagan was one of the most influential first ladies in modern American politics. For more, we are joined by NPR's Ron Elving.      Good morning, Ron.      RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.      MARTIN: She was a singular figure in American politics - and American life. Tell us a little bit about how you think of her legacy.      ELVING: Nancy Reagan was as intimate and as integral to Ronald Reagan's success as any political spouse has ever been. She really set a new standard. She was very largely responsible for his success in politics. That may be something many people have forgotten because, in her later years, she was not in the public eye. She did not go out in public very much. She didn't take public positions very often.      But if you go back to the early history Ronald Reagan's political career - when he was making the move from television pitchman to being a world leader, one of the people who was absolutely essential to that was Nancy Reagan. Her father was a very influential figure in Ronald Reagan's life. They introduced him to a world of people that was quite different from his Hollywood world, much more politically conservative.      She was with him from that transition point on. She was enormously important to his success in California and also nationally.      MARTIN: Was she always comfortable in that role - in Washington, in politics?      ELVING: There were difficult years for her at the beginning of the time they were in White House. She was largely criticized for her spending - lavish spending on things like dishes and plates and glassware and things of that nature. And there was a sense that she was trying to bring a certain air of class and elitism, perhaps, to the White House. In contrast to the Jimmy Carter years that had immediately preceded, that was something that a lot of people noticed and commented on negatively. But she turned that around with a series of public appearances that mocked her own image very successfully. And really, when she went into her campaign against drugs, the Just Say No campaign, that became much more her signature and her legacy.      MARTIN: I'm going to ask you to pivot now because, of course, we are talking in the middle of a presidential election. And there were more contests yesterday. Can you get us up to speed on where we are right now in the race?      ELVING: Yes, there is another presidential election going on. And we saw a rather dramatic development over the weekend thus far in the Republican field, where Donald Trump seems to have lost some of his altitude. He did not win as decisively as expected in Louisiana. He did not win by a large margin in Kentucky, and those were two states that were supposed to be very good for him.      Meanwhile, Ted Cruz did extraordinarily well in the small caucus states of Kansas and Nebraska - excuse me, Kansas and Maine. The Nebraska caucus was on the Democratic side. We’ll get there in a moment.      Ted Cruz had a very good night. He also won the straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference going on outside of Washington, D.C., this weekend. He had a lot to brag about last night. And, perhaps, best for Ted Cruz and good, too, for Donald Trump, perhaps, Marco Rubio won nowhere, did not do particularly and clearly has to feel disappointed with the results of this weekend thus far, although he is expected to win the Puerto Rico primary today.      MARTIN: And on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders - still putting the pressure on Hillary Clinton.      ELVING: Yes, he won two caucus events - one in Nebraska, as I mentioned, and one in Kansas. He won them both very handily. He had almost 60 percent of the vote in Nebraska - had two thirds of the vote in Kansas. So, as a result, he will pick up delegates there. He'll get 13 delegates more than Hillary will get from Kansas - four more than she'll get from Nebraska, which helps him, to some degree, make up for losing very, very badly in Louisiana, where Hillary Clinton, once again, showed great strength among African-American voters on the Democratic side. She won there with more than 70 percent of the vote, so she'll get 35 delegates from Louisiana, a much larger state. And Bernie Sanders will only get 12.      MARTIN: Briefly, Ron. We saw Mitt Romney come out and make this big speech eviscerating Donald Trump - the establishment in the GOP clearly trying to dismantle his race for the White House. Is any of it sticking?      ELVING: It appears to be because in Louisiana, we had a very clear difference between those votes that were cast several days earlier or a week or two weeks earlier. There, Donald Trump won by 2 to 1, as expected. But among those people who had just made up their minds and voted on the last day that they could participate - people who had just made up their minds voted more for Ted Cruz by a small margin.      MARTIN: NPR's Ron Elving breaking down the state of the race and remembering the legacy of former first lady Nancy Reagan.      Thanks so much, Ron.      ELVING: Thank you, Rachel.

She is best remembered for her \\"Just Say No\\" anti-drug campaign that she began during her time in the White House.

It is estimated that by the end of Reagan's administration in 1989, over 12,000 \\"Just Say No\\" clubs had formed worldwide.

I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine. Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist, a hint of surprise, a plot to emerge - but no. The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet don't have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (bring on the teen rock montage) state. The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion'. Their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are brief, confusing and entirely pointless. Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast. Lou Taylor Pucci couldn't be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert. Watch 'The Road', watch '28 days Later', watch day time TV...anything but this; I implore you.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Try just grabbing his hand and holding it. He is your boyfriend, after all, so he shouldn’t mind holding hands with you again. Maybe he hasn’t even thought about it lately, so it’s up to you to initiate.  This is a thing to try when just the two of you are alone. You don’t want to embarrass him in front of his friends. You can try to make it seem lighthearted by laughing as you grab his hand. But don’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do. You can also brush or bump your hand near his to try to initiate hand holding. It’s normal to be nervous about holding hands again. But if you are still willing to make the first move, try grabbing his hand to take him somewhere.  Take his hand and pull him along with you. You can say something like, “Come on. I want to show you something.” Or you could say, “I want to go over there. Let’s go.” You could even plan with your friend to help make it easier. For example, have your friend stand a little ways away from you and your boyfriend. Have your friend yell for you to come over to where he or she is. Then you can grab your boyfriend’s hand and say “Come on!” Then take him over to see your friend. Try giving your boyfriend a high five that goes really slowly. Then when your hands are touching in the high five, leave your hand there for a second and then slowly interlock your fingers with his and pull your hands down. This is a cute, playful way to start holding hands with your boyfriend again. Another cute way to initiate hand holding with your boyfriend again is by pretending like you want to compare how big his hands are compared to yours. This way, you’ll have to put your hands close together and touching. Then just interlock your fingers and start holding hands with him. Try saying something like, “Your hands are so much bigger than mine! Let’s compare.” And then hold your hand up for him to do the same. Summary:","output":"If you want to hold hands with your boyfriend again, try some fun and easy ways when you two are alone. You can grab his hand and laugh, or gently touch his hand to start. It's okay to be nervous. You can also take his hand to lead him somewhere or give him a slow high five and hold hands after. Another idea is to compare the size of your hands and hold hands that way.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Bashu, the Little Stranger Movie plot: The film is about a young boy from Khuzestan province, in the south of Iran, during the IranâIraq War. His parents are killed in a bombing raid on his home village and he escapes on a cargo truck to the north. Eventually he gets off and finds refuge on the farm of a Gilak woman, Na'i, who has two young children of her own. Initially, Na'i tries to shoo Bashu away, but later takes pity on him and leaves food out for him. Although Na'i is initially ambivalent toward Bashu, and he is initially suspicious of her, they come to trust one another, and Bashu becomes a member of the family, even calling Na'i \\"mom\\". Being that Bashu speaks Arabic, while Na'i and her children speak Gilaki, they have trouble communicating with each other, although Bashu is able to speak and read Persian (for example in the scene where he picks up the school textbook, reading a passage from it in an attempt to appease the children fighting). In a gesture of reciprocation and perhaps love, Bashu cares for Na'i when she falls ill, as she had done for him, crying for her and beating a drum in prayer. Throughout the film, Na'i maintains correspondence with her husband, a war veteran looking for employment, who has been gone for quite some time. She tells him about Bashu, and implores him to return home in time to help with the harvest. Bashu becomes Na'i's helper on the farm, and even accompanies her to the bazaar to sell her goods. Throughout the film, Bashu sees visions of his dead family members, which cause him to wander off. Ultimately, however, he and Na'i are always reunited. The other adults in the village harangue Na'i about taking Bashu in, often deriding his dark skin and different language, and making comments about washing the dark off of his skin. In addition to the village adults, the school age children taunt and beat Bashu, although the children prove ultimately to be more willing to accept Bashu than the adults. In one scene in which he is being taunted, Bashu picks up a school book and reads aloud a passage stating, \\"We...

Options: - demonstration - conference - furniture store - dance program - dining room  Explain why a human would choose \\"demonstration\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"demonstration\\" to answer the question above because a demonstration is the most appropriate and relevant option among the given choices. A demonstration typically involves showing or explaining how a product, service, or concept works, and it is often done in a way that allows for easy interaction and close viewing. Setting up a demonstration on a table makes sense, as it provides a convenient surface to display items or materials and allows the presenter to interact with the audience easily. To further explain why the other options are less suitable: - Conference: A conference usually refers to a large gathering of people attending presentations, discussions, and workshops. It typically takes place in a conference hall or a similar large venue and would not be set up on a table. - Furniture store: A furniture store is a retail establishment that sells furniture, not a type of presentation. The display of furniture items in a store might be considered as presentation, but it doesn't fit the context of the question. - Dance program: A dance program denotes a performance or a series of dance performances, which would typically take place on a stage, not on a table. - Dining room: A dining room is a space in a home or building designated for eating meals and, again, is not a type of presentation.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who released three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar?, using the article: In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, \\"Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear\\", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. \\"Dumb All Over\\" is a tirade on religion, as is \\"Heavenly Bank Account\\", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money.

Yes to… is one of these natural brands, based in California their products are always made from at least 95% natural ingredients, are free of parabens, phthalates and SLS, and made with recyclable materials. There are 6 collections, each involves saying ‘Yes to’ a different fruit or vegetable. The products I’ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*. Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash – the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth. The ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages. Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner – I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil. Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn’t say they smell of carrots! My thick hair feels clean and soft after using this duo and my favourite thing is that the conditioner totally prevents my hair from tangling in the shower leaving it manageable afterwards.

Multi-instrumentalists who play closely related instruments, a practice known as doubling are common in orchestra (e.g., flute players who double on piccolo and percussion players, who play snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, etc.), in jazz (e.g., saxophone players who double on clarinet or flute; or double bass players who also play electric bass); in music theatre pit orchestras (e.g., reed players who are required to play numerous reed instruments); and in other areas of classical music (e.g., church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well). Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre.

For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - RBD was a Mexican musical group that gained popularity from Televisa's teen series \\"Rebelde\\", and found international success from 2004 until their separation in 2009.

Mansion has a cinema and swimming pool with a water slide.","output":"Title: Bankruptcy Leads NFL Star to Sell Luxury Mansion; Fitness Guru Dygraaf Acquires the Palatial Estate In a surprising turn of events, a prominent NFL star, whose identity has been kept confidential, was recently compelled to place his luxurious mansion on the market after filing for bankruptcy. The stunning estate, complete with a cinema and a swimming pool that boasts a water slide, was purchased by well-known fitness guru Dygraaf. However, interestingly enough, Dygraaf does not intend to reside in the opulent property. The NFL star's journey to bankruptcy is a cautionary tale for many who may find themselves in a similar predicament. While riding high on the glory of being one of the top athletes in football, the financial woes and pressures seemed far from reality. However, as with all things, life is unpredictable, and the subsequent unexpected dip in the NFL star's fortune thrust him into dire straits. Step One: Assessing the magnitude of financial strain Bankruptcy, in this case, became the only viable option for the athlete as the gravity of his financial situation became clear. It was necessary to file for bankruptcy to prevent further decline and protect any remaining assets from being entirely lost. Step Two: Deciding to sell the luxury mansion Faced with limited options, the NFL star made the difficult decision to sell his luxurious mansion, a tangible embodiment of his success and hard-won achievements. The sale would not only help alleviate some of the financial pressure but also serve as a necessary step towards rebuilding his life. Step Three: Finding a suitable buyer The luxury property market can be a fickle one, with potential buyers searching for the perfect combination of location, amenities, and grandeur. The NFL star's mansion, with its cinema and swimming pool featuring a water slide, appeared to be an attractive option for several potential suitors. Ultimately, fitness guru Dygraaf emerged as the winning buyer. Step Four: Closure of the deal and moving forward With Dygraaf's purchase of the mansion, the NFL star had successfully completed a crucial phase in his journey towards a more stable financial future. Though the mansion no longer belongs to him, the sale serves as both a tangible and symbolic turning point in his life. Dygraaf's acquisition of the mansion does not come with the intention of making it his new abode. Although the fitness guru has not divulged any specific plans for the property, it is not set to stay vacant indefinitely. In the meantime, the mansion stands as a breathtaking example of luxury living, even as its previous owner embarks on a new chapter in his life. In conclusion, the NFL star's bankruptcy is a stark reminder that even the rich and famous can experience great financial turbulence. The sale of his breathtaking luxury mansion to fitness guru Dygraaf is an essential step towards rebuilding his life and plotting a more secure path forward. Furthermore, Dygraaf's acquisition of the mansion is shrouded in intrigue as the fitpreneur's intentions with the property remain unclear, sparking curiosity in the world of real estate and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Pope Zachary (679  15 March 752) reigned from 3 December or 5 December 741 to his death in 752. A Greek from Santa Severina, Calabria, he was the last pope of the Byzantine Papacy. Most probably he was a deacon of the Roman Church and as such signed the decrees of the Roman council of 732 and was on intimate terms with Gregory III, whom he succeeded on 5 December 741.  - Childeric III ( c. 717 -- c. 754 ) was King of Francia from 743 until he was deposed by Pope Zachary in March 751 at the instigation of Pepin the Short . Although his parentage is uncertain , he is considered the last Frankish king from the Merovingian dynasty . Once Childeric was deposed , Pepin the Short , who was the father of emperor Charlemagne , was crowned the first king of the Franks from the Carolingian dynasty .  - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.  - Pepin the Short (, c. 714  24 September 768) was the King of the Franks from 751 until his death. He was the first of the Carolingians to become king.  - The Byzantine Papacy was a period of Byzantine domination of the papacy from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the Byzantine Emperor for episcopal consecration, and many popes were chosen from the \\"apocrisiarii\\" (liaisons from the pope to the emperor) or the inhabitants of Byzantine Greece, Byzantine Syria, or Byzantine Sicily. Justinian I conquered the Italian peninsula in the Gothic War (535554) and appointed the next three popes, a practice that would be continued by his successors and later be delegated to the Exarchate of Ravenna.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.

She lives at home, pays no bills and even maintains an expensive hobby that her family pays for. She's also a compulsive liar and my partner and I have caught her lying multiple times. Until recently I've just ignored her, I'm 27 not 16 I don't give any real shits about this kind of high school drama, but recently this has changed. Some poor sap got involved with her long distance, and has now moved across the country to be with her.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What object can be used to create a rainbow?\\" and the following answer choices:  - power  - refracted  - the sun  - arc  - lenses  - flowers  - prism  - leprechauns  Now knowing that arainbow is formed by refraction of light by separating light into all different colors and light passing through a prism is refracted or divided into the colors of the spectrum, choose the best answer. Answer:","output":"The best answer choice for the question \\"What object can be used to create a rainbow?\\" is \\"prism.\\"  A rainbow is an optical phenomenon that creates a multicolored, continuous arc of light in the sky. It occurs when sunlight is refracted, or bent, as it passes through water droplets in the atmosphere. The sunlight separates into its various color components, which are then reassembled and projected as a circular arc due to the shape of the droplets. The colors of the spectrum – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet – are typically present in a rainbow and appear in that order. Prisms are able to create a rainbow effect because they are capable of refracting light. A prism is a transparent object, often made of glass or another material, that has been shaped to disperse light into multiple colors. It typically has triangular facets or faces, which allow light to enter the prism and then exit at various angles. When white light, which consists of many colors, enters a prism, each color is bent or refracted at a slightly different angle. This phenomenon occurs because each color has a unique wavelength, which means that it travels at a slightly different speed within the prism. Due to this refraction, the colors are dispersed and can be seen individually, creating a spectrum or rainbow-like effect. The other answer choices provided are misleading or irrelevant in this context. While the sun is the primary light source that provides the energy to produce a rainbow, it is not an object that can be used to create a rainbow. Leprechauns and flowers are also unrelated to the physics behind rainbows. Power, refracted, and arc are terms associated with rainbows, but they are not objects that can be used to create them. Lenses, like prisms, can bend the light and separate it into colors; however, in the context of creating a rainbow, a prism is the more appropriate choice, as lenses generally serve to focus or diverge light, rather than dispersing light in a way that produces a visible and distinct spectrum of colors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please add spaces between words: Thesociallyoptimumoutputandpricearegivenbytheintersectionofthedemandscheduleandthemarginalcostcurve.","output":"The socially optimum output and price are given by the intersection of the demand schedule and the marginal cost curve. In an economic context, the \\"socially optimum output\\" refers to the level of production that maximizes the total net benefit to society. This output level is considered efficient because it balances the costs and benefits of production while minimizing negative externalities, such as pollution or the depletion of natural resources. The \\"demand schedule\\" represents the relationship between the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing to purchase and its price. It is typically downward-sloping, reflecting the fact that consumers demand more of a good or service when its price is lower. On the other hand, the \\"marginal cost curve\\" represents the relationship between the cost of producing an additional unit of a good or service and the quantity produced. It often initially slopes downward, reflecting gains from economies of scale and eventually slopes upward as diminishing returns set in. Determining the socially optimum output and price involves finding the point where these two curves intersect. To understand why this is the case, consider the following: 1. At the intersection point, the price consumers are willing to pay for a good or service (represented by the demand schedule) is equal to the additional cost of producing one more unit (represented by the marginal cost curve). This means that the total value consumers place on the good or service is equal to the total cost associated with producing that quantity. 2. The fact that the total value to consumers equals the total cost of production implies that resource allocation is efficient. No other output level would balance both the costs and benefits as effectively as the socially optimum output level. 3. If production were to occur below the socially optimum output level, the total value placed on the goods or services by consumers would be greater than the cost of production, suggesting that society would benefit from an increase in production. Conversely, if production were to occur above the socially optimum level, the cost of producing an additional unit would outweigh the total value that consumers place on it, indicating that it would be more efficient to reduce production. 4. The price associated with the socially optimum output level is known as the \\"socially optimum price\\" because it reflects the true costs and benefits of producing and consuming a good or service. This price does not necessarily correspond with the market price, which can be distorted by market failures such as monopoly power, externalities, or government interventions. So, the intersection of the demand schedule and the marginal cost curve is a crucial point in determining the most efficient and socially desirable levels of output and price for any given good or service."},{"instruction":"Title: Good and Easy to Install Review: The product is easy to install and works great.I wish I could adjust the distance a little bit, but overall great product.

Question: \\"How are members chosen for the US Congress?\\"  Context: \\"In 1864, Andrew Johnson (a War Democrat from Tennessee) was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln. He became President after Lincoln's assassination in 1865. Under Johnson's lenient re-admission policy, Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the U.S. Congress, on July 24, 1866. Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Members of the United States Congress, which consists of two houses - the Senate and the House of Representatives - are chosen through a combination of direct elections and political party nominations. Each state has its own process for nominating, electing, and readmitting members of Congress. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. The Election Process: In general, members of Congress are elected through direct elections held in each of the 50 states in the United States. The Constitution of the United States mandates that members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years, while Senators serve six-year terms, with one-third of the Senate being elected every two years. 2. Candidate Nomination: Before an individual can run for a seat in Congress, they must first be nominated by their political party. In the United States, the two major political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, hold primary elections or caucuses in each state to select their candidates for the general election. Candidates may also run as independents or members of third parties, but these candidates typically face a more difficult path to election as they often lack the resources and support of the major parties. 3. Running for Office: Once a candidate has been nominated, they must run for office against other nominated candidates in the general election. This involves campaigning, mobilizing supporters, raising funds, and participating in candidate debates among other activities. The candidate who receives the most votes in the general election is declared the winner and will serve as a member of Congress representing their state. 4. Readmission of Members: In some cases, such as the one mentioned in the context of the question, members from previously seceded states had to be readmitted to Congress following the Civil War. In the case of Tennessee, the state had to meet certain conditions, such as ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment, before its elected members could be readmitted to Congress. Tennessee was the first to do so and, as a result, did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period. 5. Vacancies and Special Elections: If a member of Congress dies, resigns, or is expelled, a special election may be held to fill the vacant seat. The processes for calling and conducting special elections vary by state and sometimes even by the particular circumstances of the vacancy. Governors may also appoint temporary replacements for vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held. It is important to note that the rules and procedures for choosing members of Congress have evolved significantly since the Civil War era, making the process generally more inclusive and democratic today. The context provided in the question refers specifically to a unique historical period during the Reconstruction era, when the United States was grappling with the reintegration of seceded states and various other political issues. However, the general principles of direct elections and party nominations remain similar across historical periods and serve as the foundation for choosing members of Congress in the modern United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When it comes to life coaching, there is no judging books by their covers. When a client comes to you, have the first session be an in-depth, cover-all-your-bases interview. What do they want from you? What part of their lives are they looking to change? What are their goals? Most people will come in with an idea -- a very specific idea (hence the reason most life coaches have specialties) of what they want to accomplish. Whether it's weight loss, wrapping their minds around their blooming business, or tackling their relationship issues, they know. Let them guide you initially and listen. Once you set up a base of clients, it's gonna be easy to refer to one in your head as that-one-guy-who-drinks-coffee-addiction-who-still-has-narcolepsy. Don't do that. He won't like it. Keep portfolios of all your clients, get the details down, and keep them straight. If you don't stay organized, you'll end up missing a call with client number #14 who abandons you the next day. It's also important to make them feel like they are your most important client. Every little detail they've told you needs to be something you remember and take into account when you're working with them. Not only will they be impressed and trust you more, but you'll be able to make more accurate decisions on what would help them if you keep your facts straight. You'll soon find what works best for you, but most coaches say they work with each client around 3 times a month. Some clients will require more work and some less, but three times a month is average. The length of time for each session is up to you and the client. You don't necessarily have to do the sessions in person, though those are obviously the most personal. You could also do them over the phone or even via programs like Skype. If you're corporate or executive, you may find that your clients are traveling a lot and session over the phone are the only option. If you want to really be successful, you'll want to open up your business to clients all over the World. Skype is a poor option in many countries and areas as it drops frequently. Learn to use other systems such as Google Hangouts where you can meet face-to-face without the frustration of poor technology as with Skype. Life coaches aren't just expensive advice givers. That'd be terrible. It's about helping others explore their choices and figuring out what's best for them. It's only the bad life coaches that dispense advice and hang up. You're really working at changing the behavior -- which is about a million more times valuable than simply telling a client what to do. No one else needs another person (much less a virtual stranger) telling them what to do with our lives -- we all get that from our in-laws, our siblings, and the occasional high school friend who thinks they know everything. You're answering the \\"how,\\" not the what. You can give them the process. To a certain extent, you're a teacher or guide. When you hang up the phone with a client, your job doesn't just end there. You have to make sure they're putting into action what you two have discussed. You need to give them homework. Whether it's exploring different business plans or talking to their ex-husband, you have to give them actions that lead to change. What would be best for them? And how do you make sure they do it? You will have clients that don't cooperate. You'll have clients that don't agree with you. You'll have clients that think you're wasting their precious time. These will happen. You have to take the good with the bad and know when to cut your losses. If a client doesn't like your style, then it could be resistance and fear coming up. Don't take on a client you don't get along with, and you won't have these problems. As you work with more clients, you'll be able to discover in your discovery session whether or not you will be a good fit. If you don't know how to do a discovery session (it is NOT a coaching session), then you need to learn how to do one right away. See your business coach or group for help. In the end, that's ultimately what it is about. We all struggle with this thing called life and a life coach is there to shine the light for us down that dark, scary tunnel we're all wandering. If you've done your best to hit all their goals and have shown them the options, you've done your part. They'll be better for having worked with you. Summary:","output":"Being a successful life coach involves conducting in-depth initial interviews with clients to understand their specific goals, maintaining organized client portfolios, adapting to clients' needs, making use of various communication platforms, providing practical actions for positive behavioral change, understanding when to let go uncooperative clients, and ultimately showing clients their choices and guiding them towards their goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which race was held again on June 23, 1935?  Briarcliff High School offers intramural sports and fields junior varsity and varsity teams in sixteen sports as the Briarcliff Bears. During the 38 years that Pace University operated its Briarcliff campus, it maintained fourteen intercollegiate varsity sports teams which played at the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division II level.Briarcliff Manor has a history of auto racing. The First American International Road Race, sponsored by the village, centered around it. The prize, the Briarcliff Trophy valued at over 10,000 (278,900 in 2018), was donated and presented by Walter Law. The race began at 4:45 a.m. on April 24, 1908 at the front of the Briarcliff Lodge and ending at the village grandstand. The winner, Arthur Strang in an Isotta Fraschini, covered the 240 miles (390 km) in five hours and fourteen minutes. More than 300,000 people watched the race, and the village had more than 100,000 visitors that day.On November 12, 1934, the Automobile Racing Club of America held another road race in Briarcliff Manor. The 100-mile (160 km) race was won by Langdon Quimby, driving a Willys 77, in a time of two hours and seven minutes. The race was held again on June 23, 1935; Quimby won again, four minutes faster than the previous year. In 1977, during the village's 75th anniversary, fifteen old racing cars participated in a motorcade around the 1934 race's route. In 2008, the village commemorated the first race's centennial in a parade featuring about 60 antique cars. The answer to this question is:","output":"The race that was held again on June 23, 1935, is the road race organized by the Automobile Racing Club of America in Briarcliff Manor."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Context: One time I was walking my puppy (profile pic) who was then around 5 months, with my mum and grandma. By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn’t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked. My mom would later laugh at me because I became so pale and because I tried to baby talk a dog to leave us alone. Question: When did he and his puppy spot a German Shepherd and a Husky?

Q:Information:  - The Luna programme (from the Russian word  \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation.  - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures.  - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys .  - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\").  - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.    What entity does 'luna e-3 no.1' has the relation 'series' with? A:","output":"Luna E-3 No.1 has a relation \\"series\\" with the Luna Programme, a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Both Luna E-3 No.1 and the Luna Programme are part of the Soviet Union's efforts to explore the Moon using unmanned spacecraft for various scientific purposes, including taking pictures, studying its chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The calls were made a week after Libyan forces reacted violently to protests in Libyan cities in 2011. In two calls, the ex-UK prime minister offered to help the dictator work with the US and EU to resolve the crisis. But Gaddafi, who was overthrown in 2011, insisted the protests were a plot by al-Qaeda sleeper cells. The transcripts were provided by Mr Blair's office to the Commons foreign affairs committee after he gave evidence at its inquiry last month into UK foreign policy towards Libya. 'Ready to fight' In the calls, made on 25 February 2011, Mr Blair warned Gaddafi if he did not show he would \\"stand aside and go somewhere safe\\", it could result in \\"bloodshed for a lot of Libyan people\\". He added that the situation could go \\"past the point [of no return]\\" within days. But Gaddafi said his forces did not inflict violence on ordinary Libyan people and that the protests were an attempt by armed Islamic extremists to \\"control the Mediterranean... and then attack Europe\\". He likened the protests to extremist violence in Afghanistan, Algeria, Nigeria and Pakistan and said Mr Blair's suggestions for ways forward sounded like \\"colonisation\\". \\"If you want to reap Libya, we are ready to fight. It will be like Iraq,\\" Gaddafi said, ending the conversation by telling Mr Blair to \\"leave us alone\\". Foreign affairs committee chairman Crispin Blunt said evidence submitted to the Commons inquiry so far showed Western policy-makers were \\"less perceptive than Gaddafi about the risks of intervention for both the Libyan people and the Western interests\\". He added the committee may consider whether Gaddafi's warnings about extremist groups were \\"wrongly ignored\\" because of the dictator's \\"otherwise delusional take on international affairs\\".

I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Question: What factors contributed to the increased use of vinyl in the production of records after the Second World War? Answer: The increased use of vinyl in record production after the Second World War can be attributed to the introduction of new record players with lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy, making vinyl more practical for use. Additionally, the production of special vinyl pressings, such as RCA Victor's transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings, Decca's Deccalite 78s, and other vinyl concoctions used for children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings, contributed to the wider use of vinyl in the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","output":"If we analyze both sentences, we can come up with the following conclusion: Sentence 1: The speaker explains a future situation in which they will end up with the Parisian (presumably a car), while their wife will have a newer one. Sentence 2: The speaker says they don't really like the Parisian, but they'll manage it. Now, we need to check if Sentence 2 is true, given that Sentence 1 is true. Sentence 1 establishes that the speaker will end up with the Parisian, but it doesn't provide any information about their feelings or preferences for that car. Sentence 2, on the other hand, expresses the speaker's opinion – they don't really like the Parisian. And even though they are not fond of it, they will manage it. Based on the information provided, we cannot determine if Sentence 2 is true or false just by assuming Sentence 1 is true. The preferences and feelings about the car are not connected to the fact the speaker will end up with it. It is entirely possible for the speaker to end up with something they don't like or vice versa. So, the correct answer is: Option 2).

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?  (A). no;  (B). yes;","output":"(B). yes; The two questions are asking about the same thing: the perceived under-performance of India at the 2016 Rio Olympics compared to their performance in the London and Beijing Olympics. Analyzing why a country's performance in the Olympics fluctuates requires considering numerous factors, including the number and quality of athletes participating, their preparation and training, the level of competition, and the support from the government and sporting organizations in that country. With regards to India and their performance in the 2016 Rio Olympics, several factors can be noted: 1. Lack of Infrastructure and Resources: Despite being the second-most populated country in the world, India still lacks structured sports infrastructure for optimal training. Many athletes still face hardships in getting quality training facilities and professional coaching.  2. Poor Sports Culture: Unlike in countries like the USA, China, and Australia, in India, sports aren't integrated into school curriculums or widely encouraged as potential careers. As a result, India may fail to identify and nurture promising sports talent from a young age. 3. Lack of Governmental Support: While India has a Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, it lacks the budget and resources compared to their counterparts in the countries that dominate the Olympics. This lack of support can contribute to a variety of issues, from not having suitable training facilities to not being able to attract and retain quality coaches. 4. Unpredictable Performance: Sports performances can be unpredictable, and even well-prepared athletes can have off days. The weather, the athletes' health, and a host of other factors can influence their performance on the day of the event. 5. Global Competition: The Olympics is a highly competitive event with athletes from around the world giving their best performances. Any small factor can give a competitive advantage, and countries and athletes who can leverage these factors most effectively will have the upper hand. In conclusion, while India has had some outstanding performances in the past Olympic Games, their performance does fluctify due to a host of factors, including lack of sporting culture and institutional support, lack of structured sports infrastructure, and the high level of global competition. It's worth noting that in the 2016 Rio Olympics, India won two medals - a silver by P.V. Sindhu in badminton and a bronze by Sakshi Malik in wrestling. This may be considered under-performance compared to previous years, but it's also indicative of progress in certain areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: “What was your worst makeup disaster?” Do fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Question: Who was frozen in place? Options:  A. not enough information  B. The friend  C. The waiter  D.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand.\\" if \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\"?","output":"It is not possible to conclude that \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand\\" simply based on the statement that \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\" These two statements are independent of one another and do not share any direct connection or causality. To understand why this is the case, we can analyze the two statements and explore their relationship based on context, logical reasoning, and the situation we are presented with. First, let's consider the statement \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\" This statement describes an action performed by a dog, specifically the occurrence of a dog playing in the mud. It gives information about the dog's activity and the location where the action takes place. On the other hand, \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand\\" is a statement that describes an action performed by a woman, namely working on a project which involves thread. Here, we receive information about the woman's activity and the materials she is using. By comparing these two statements, it becomes apparent that they describe two separate events that involve different subjects performing distinct actions in different circumstances. There is no explicit connection or relationship suggested between the subject matters. Furthermore, there is no implied causal link between these two statements, meaning that the occurrence of the dog playing in the mud doesn't directly cause or affect the woman's actions working on a project with thread. Now, in real-world scenarios, it is possible for these two events to happen simultaneously or within the same general time frame. However, this simultaneous occurrence does not indicate any direct connection between the two events either. For instance, while a dog is playing in the mud outside, a woman could be working on a project with thread indoors. Their actions remain distinct and unrelated, even if they are happening at the same time. In conclusion, based on logical reasoning and analysis, we cannot derive the conclusion that \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand\\" solely because \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\" These two events and the actions described within them are separate, unrelated occurrences without any direct connection or causality. To make any assertions or draw conclusions about the woman's actions, we would require additional information or evidence that explicitly connects the two statements or provides context for their relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The original sentence states, \\"A woman in white gets her makeup done by a woman with short blond-hair while a woman in a purple dress watches.\\" This sentence provides information about three different women involved in the scene, each with distinct attributes. The first woman is described as being in white, which is the most critical detail for deducing the truth of the given query. The original sentence clearly specifies that a woman is wearing white, confirming that the statement \\"The woman is in white\\" is accurate. It is important to note that even though there are other women mentioned, the contextual goal is to determine if the statement referring to the woman in white holds true. The second woman in the sentence, who has short blond-hair, is the one performing the makeup service for the woman in white. Though this woman is involved in the overall scenario, she does not impact the validity of the statement concerning the woman in white.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the 1947 film that depicted the massacre that commemorated by a blue plaque until 2007? , can you please find it?   The Skelmanthorpe Flag is believed to have been made in Skelmanthorpe, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1819. It was in part made to honour the victims of the Peterloo Massacre. The Free Trade Hall, home of the Anti-Corn Law League, was built partly as a \\"cenotaph raised on the shades of the victims\\" of Peterloo. Until 2007 the massacre was commemorated by a blue plaque on the wall of the present building, the third to occupy the site, now the Radisson Hotel. It was regarded as a less than appropriate memorial because it under reported the incident as a dispersal, and the deaths were omitted completely. In a 2006 survey conducted by The Guardian, Peterloo came second to St. Mary's Church, Putney, the venue for the Putney Debates, as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument. A Peterloo Massacre Memorial Campaign was set up to lobby for a more appropriate monument to an event that has been described as Manchester's Tiananmen Square.In 2007, Manchester City Council replaced the original blue plaque with a red one, giving a fuller account of the events of 1819. It was unveiled on 10 December 2007 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Councillor Glynn Evans. Under the heading \\"St. Peter's Fields: The Peterloo Massacre\\", the new plaque reads: On 16 August 1819 a peaceful rally of 60,000 pro-democracy reformers, men, women and children, was attacked by armed cavalry resulting in 15 deaths and over 600 injuries. In 1968, in celebration of its centenary, the Trades Union Congress commissioned British composer Sir Malcolm Arnold to write the Peterloo Overture. Other musical commemorations include \\"Ned Ludd Part 5\\" on British folk rock group Steeleye Span's 2006 album Bloody Men, and Rochdale rock band Tractor's suite of five songs written and recorded in 1973, later included on their 1992 release Worst Enemies. The events are depicted in the 1947 film Fame Is the Spur, based on the Howard Spring novel of the same name and in the 2018 Mike Leigh film Peterloo.

Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. In the UK, they have had six number one albums and 13 top 20 singles, including two number ones.  - Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars is the third studio album by British big beat musician Fatboy Slim. It was released on 6 November 2000 through Skint Records. It features Macy Gray, Ashley Slater, Bootsy Collins, Roland Clark, Jim Morrison, and Roger Sanchez as guest contributors. The album's title, mentioned in the single \\"Weapon of Choice\\" is an allusion to the Oscar Wilde quote \\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars\\".  - Skint Records is a Brighton based dance music record label owned by JC Reid, Tim Jeffery and Damian Harris. It was created as a sublabel of Loaded Records, also founded by Reid and Jeffery. Along with Wall of Sound, the label was a leader in the big beat music scene of the mid to late 1990s.   - Roland Clark is a house music DJ, producer, songwriter and vocalist. In the past, he has used the aliases Jesus Jackson, Digital Pimps, Dark Clark, South Street Player, and is also founding member of the dance music project Urban Soul. He learned how to write songs from his childhood mentor Calvin Gaines.  - Breakbeat as a term refers to one of two distinct things. Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well.  - Propellerheads were a British big beat musical ensemble, formed in 1995 and made up of electronic producers Will White and Alex Gifford. The term \\"propellerhead\\" is slang for a nerd, and when Gifford and White heard a friend from California use this in a conversation, they thought it would be the perfect name for their band.  - The Prodigy are an English electronic music group from Braintree, Essex, formed by Liam Howlett in 1990. The members were originally Liam Howlett (keyboardist and composer), Keith Flint (dancer and vocalist), Maxim (MC and vocalist), Leeroy Thornhill (dancer and occasional live keyboardist), and a female dancer and vocalist called Sharky, however, both Leeroy and Sharky left the band for different reasons.  - Big beat is an electronic music genre that usually uses heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns - common to acid house. The term has been used since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe music by artists such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Cut La Roc, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada.  - \`\` Sunset ( Bird of Prey ) '' is a song by the British big beat artist Fatboy Slim , released from his 2000 album Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars . The single peaked at No. 9 in the UK and No. 77 in Switzerland . The song samples Jim Morrison 's vocals from the Doors song \`\` Bird of Prey . ''  - The Crystal Method is an American electronic music and keyboardist duo formed in Las Vegas, Nevada by Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland in the early 1990s. The Crystal Method's music has appeared in numerous TV shows, films, video games, and advertisements. Their album \\"Vegas\\", was certified platinum in 2007.  - James Douglas \\"Jim\\" Morrison (December 8, 1943  July 3, 1971) was an American singer, songwriter, and poet, best remembered as the lead singer of The Doors. Due to his lyrics, wild personality, performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and death, Morrison is regarded by critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock music history.  - Groove Armada are an English electronic music duo, composed of Andy Cato and Tom Findlay. They achieved chart success with their singles \\"I See You Baby\\" and \\"Superstylin'\\". The group has released eight studio albums, four of which have charted in the UK Albums Chart top 50.  - Basement Jaxx are an English electronic music duo consisting of Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe. The pair got their name from the regular night club they held in their hometown of Brixton, London, UK. They first rose to popularity in the mid 1990s. As the \\"British Hit Singles & Albums\\" book duly noted \\"they surfaced from the underground house scene, are regular transatlantic club chart-toppers and won the BRIT Award for Best Dance Act in 2002 and 2004\\".  - Lee Potter (born 4 January 1972), known by his stage name Cut La Roc, is a British electronic musician, considered as a pioneer of big beat, a genre fusing elements of  hip hop, house and rock  - Macy Gray (born Natalie Renée McIntyre; September 6, 1967) is an American R&B, jazz and soul singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actress, known for her distinctive raspy voice, and a singing style heavily influenced by Billie Holiday.  - Acid house is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. The style was defined primarily by the deep basslines and \\"squelching\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble. Question: Why don't schools try to encourage creativity? Options: A: They don't understand the importance of education. B: They don't want their students to make mistakes. C: They pay too much attention to examination marks and language skills. D: They think it more important to remember some information.

It becomes apparent that Bruce is regularly attacked by other inmates who brawl with him 6 to 1 at breakfast. Having beaten the majority of them, Bruce is punished with solitary confinement by the prison guards. In solitary, Bruce is approached by a man called Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard displays a great deal of knowledge and authority by getting an audience with Bruce from the prison and by stating that he knows who Bruce is. Ducard then offers Bruce a place in the League of Shadows -- a collective of vigilantes and assassins. He deems that the League can offer Bruce a path to true justice instead of 'locking himself away with criminals to take them on one at a time.'

Sarah Nicole Henderson, 29, is jailed in Henderson County, charged with two counts of capital murder.

Sarah Henderson of Mabank is accused of killing her daughters Kaylee, 7 and Kenlie, 5. WFAA Courtesy      The two children were asleep in the living room and Jacob Henderson was asleep in bed when the shootings occurred, according to the recordings.      “She was asleep when I went to sleep last night and I woke up, she come in there and she said ‘Babe, I just shot the kids.’ I didn’t want to believe it and I went in there and they were dead,” he says.      “I just need some help.”      A woman screams in the background, “Please shoot me please, I’m sorry.”      The children were both shot in the head, Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher.      Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher that his wife was not under the influence of drugs that night.      Deputies had responded to the home earlier Wednesday night, at about 11:30 p.m., when Jacob Henderson called 911 asking for help with his wife. He called back and canceled the request, but deputies had already arrived and were told the couple was fine, the recordings indicate.      The second call reporting the children had been shot came at 2:24 a.m.      The children were taken to Dallas for autopsies.      The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County district attorney’s office are assisting in the investigation.      “The family has had previous contact with CPS in 2010 but not recently,” CPS spokeswoman Marissa Gonzales said Thursday in an email. “Details of those interactions are confidential.” ||||| Sarah Henderson has been charged with capital murder in the death of her two daughters. (Henderson County Sheriff’s Office)      The first EMS call came in at 11:29 p.m. Wednesday.      “I want to get somebody out here to check my wife out,” Jacob Henderson said, his voice calm and even. He didn’t think his wife was trying to commit suicide, he told the dispatcher, but she was “freaking out like somebody is out to get her.”      Seven minutes later, Henderson called again. His wife was “fine now,” and he wanted to cancel his earlier request for help.      Still, deputies from the Henderson County Sheriff’s Office came to Henderson’s home in Mabank, Tex., roughly 55 miles southeast of Dallas. It was the home he shared with his wife, Sarah Nicole Henderson, 29, and her daughters, ages 7 and 5.      “A male and female told the Deputies they were fine and no one was in danger or jeopardy,” read a news release from the Sheriff’s Office.      Henderson’s next call came in at 2:24 a.m. Thursday. Choking back tears, panting for breath, and at times wailing, Henderson told the 911 dispatcher that his wife had shot her children.

She kept trying to pry back the gun Jacob Henderson took away from her.      In the background of that distraught 911 call, Sarah Henderson can be heard asking: “Why did I do that, Jake?”      [Student charged after bragging about putting roommate’s toothbrush ‘where the sun doesn’t shine’]      He had fallen asleep and awakened to hear his wife say, “Jake, I shot the kids,” Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher.

Recordings of Jacob Henderson’s EMS and 911 calls were released by the Sheriff’s Office on Friday.      County Sheriff Botie Hillhouse told The Washington Post that officials had yet to determine a motive in the killings. Hillhouse said officers had been dispatched to the house in 2015 for a “verbal disturbance,” but all they found was Sarah Henderson standing in her yard, arguing with someone over the phone.      “We hadn’t had much to do with her until Wednesday night and then again Thursday,” Hillhouse said.      CBS News reported that Texas Child Protective Services confirmed it had been in contact with the family six years ago, but other details were confidential.      Sarah Henderson has been charged with one count of capital murder, with another capital murder charge pending, officials said. She was arraigned Friday morning with bail set at 2 million and remains in jail under suicide watch. Hillhouse said the punishment for capital murder in Texas is life in prison or the death penalty.      The gruesome case took another dark turn Friday when investigators announced Sarah Henderson had planned for at least two weeks to kill her children, though authorities did not provide further details to support this claim. She had also intended to kill her husband, “but the entire crime did not go as planned,” a news release said. ABC News quoted Hillhouse as saying that the gun malfunctioned when Sarah Henderson tried to kill Jacob.      [Disney knew its property had alligators.

He added that Sarah Henderson has another son who lives with his father outside the county.      The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County District Attorney’s Office are assisting with the investigation. It was not clear if Sarah Henderson had obtained an attorney.      A neighbor, Jaylyne Palmer, told NBCDFW that she had never had a conversation with Sarah Henderson, but that the girls would ride their bikes through her driveway.      “They would draw pictures and put them in the mailbox for us,” Palmer said.      Jacob Henderson’s 911 call recorded Sarah Henderson saying, “I’m sorry.”      “Why though?” Jacob Henderson cried. “Why? Why? Why?”      Then he saw flashes of red and blue light come down the street.      “They’re here,” he told the dispatcher, before hanging up.

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day.

His father had several companies and got a lot of money. He could give his son all the young man wanted. He was busy with his business and never asked him how he got along with his studies. So the boy spent most time in the restaurants or cinemas. Of course he was weak at his lessons and learned nothing at school. He made many friends but none of them was good and when they knew he came from a rich family, they began to teach him to gamble . Of course he lost much money. Now Mr Reese was twenty and finished middle school. He could not do anything. But his father didn't mind it until one day he found the young man had sold one of his companies. He became so angry that he made him leave his house. The young man couldn't gamble any longer. His friends made him pay his debt. He had to ask his mother to help him and the woman often gave him some money. But one evening his father happened to find it. The old man stopped his wife from doing so. They began to fight in the room. The young man brought out a knife and killed his father. His mother helped him to run away, but soon after that he was caught and sentenced to death.

The passage describes the unfortunate circumstances of Mr. Reese's life, which can be primarily attributed to his poor choices and the company he kept. His wealthy upbringing provided him with the means to indulge in a carefree, unproductive lifestyle. Resultantly, he gravitated towards undesirable friends who were more interested in exploiting his wealth than providing meaningful companionship. These unsavory individuals recognized that Mr. Reese came from a wealthy family and saw an opportunity to profit from that circumstance. As a result, they introduced him to gambling, a vice that they knew would lead to significant losses for Mr. Reese, thereby putting themselves in a position to gain money from him. They took advantage of his naivety, inexperience, and the fact that his father was largely absent from his life. For these reasons, it's clear that the bad young men taught Mr. Reese to gamble so that they could get much money from him.

They are known for their strong influence on the development of extreme metal. Formed in 1982 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and was active until 1993. It re-formed in 2001 and disbanded following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008. Celtic Frost's frontman, guitarist and singer Tom Gabriel Fischer, adopted the alias Tom Warrior. With Steve Warrior on bass, he formed one of the earliest extreme metal bands, Hellhammer, in 1981. Steve Warrior was later replaced by Martin Eric Ain - also a pseudonym. The band attracted a small international fan-base, got signed to Noise Records in Germany and recorded their debut EP Apocalyptic Raids in March 1984, now a rare find on eBay or second-hand record stores around the world.  Metal publications were also skeptical of Hellhammer's musical endeavor. Metal Forces loathed the group; that started a long-lasting feud between that zine and Warrior, which kept Celtic Frost from playing in England for a couple of years. Rock Power was not fond of Hellhammer either - they considered it \\"the most terrible, abhorrent, and atrocious thing 'musicians' were ever allowed to record\\". In fact, they were \\"receiving miserable reviews everywhere\\", Warrior concluded.  Regarding the controversial status of his former band, Thomas said:  Way back in 1984 and 85, when Martin Eric Ain and I recorded Celtic Frost's first two albums Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion, Hellhammer lasted on us almost like a curse. Even though Hellhammer was the very reason we had thought over our goals and conceived the Frost, HH's left-overs kept being mighty rocks in our way. Many voices saw Frost as the same band with just a name-change. The lack of musical quality in HH made it almost impossible for us to get an unbiased reaction for Frost. To make a long story short, it almost killed all our work and dreams.  By May 1984, Hellhammer had disbanded. Fischer and Ain, along with session drummer Stephen Priestly, regrouped as Celtic Frost. Their 1984 debut mini-LP, Morbid Tales was a hit in the underground metal scene, and the band set out on its first tour, through Germany and Austria. This was followed with an EP Emperor's Return. Both early releases are now available on the one CD.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What instrument did Steve Warrior play?","output":"Steve Warrior played bass in the band.

Who was started Social Media war between Indian and Pakistani? Which army special unit is much more experienced and well trained, the SSG(N) or the MARCOS? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available options:  + no;  + yes;","output":"To complete the task, I will first research the origin of the social media war between India and Pakistan. Then, I will compare the SSG(N) and MARCOS in terms of experience and training. Finally, I'll evaluate if the questions asked are the same. Step 1: Research the origin of the social media war between India and Pakistan. After conducting some research, it's clear that it is difficult to pinpoint a single incident or individual responsible for the start of social media wars between Indian and Pakistani users. These tensions can be traced back to historical conflicts and disagreements between the two nations. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to attribute the start of social media conflicts to one person or event. Step 2: Compare the SSG(N) and MARCOS in terms of experience and training. SSG(N) – The Special Service Group (Navy) is the elite special operations unit of the Pakistan Navy. SSG(N) is responsible for conducting missions such as direct action, unconventional warfare, and special reconnaissance. They are trained in various courses, including paratrooping, advanced diving, and other specialized weapons handling courses. MARCOS – The Marine Commandos (MARCOS) are the elite special operations unit of the Indian Navy. Their primary role is to carry out amphibious warfare, counter-terrorism, special reconnaissance, and unconventional warfare. MARCOS undergoes rigorous training, which includes diving courses, basic marine commando courses, airborne training, and more. While both SSG(N) and MARCOS are highly trained and experienced units, specific comparison is difficult due to the differences in objectives, operational theaters, and the fact that the exact details of their abilities are not publicly disclosed. Step 3: Evaluate if the questions asked are the same. Upon evaluating the provided questions, I would say that the questions are not the same. The first one is focused on the origin of social media conflicts between India and Pakistan, while the second question compares the SSG(N) and MARCOS special operation units in terms of experience and training. Answer: Based on my analysis, I would choose the option: + no; These questions are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

That's probably why I am writing this, because it seems an easier way of telling you how thankful I am to you. When I first got ill two years ago and had to be taken to hospital, you were the first person I called to tell, maybe because I knew Mum wasn't going to answer her phone, but probably because you are the first person I call in an emergency. As one illness turned into another and I was stuck in hospital for weeks, feeling sorry for myself, you were still at my beside trying to talk to me to cheer me up. The illness hit my kidney  and we then realized that I was going to need a transport sooner or later. You put yourself forward to be tested as soon as possible and it turned out you were a perfect match. Then last year, in March, we both went down for the operation. I woke a few hours afterwards and felt better. It wasn't until the following day that we got to see each other again. We hugged silently and asked one another how we were. But I never said the words I should have--- thank you. To this day, I still haven't said those words to you for my kidney. In the month after the operation, when we were both at home recovering, I made you lunch, went for walks with you. It's my way of saying that I care for you a great deal and that I am truly thankful for what you did for me. I want you to know that my silence towards you and the times you tried to talk to me and got nothing weren't because of you. Maybe one day when you will read this, I hope you know that in my own silent way, I am for ever thankful.

To trace a stencil onto wood using a pencil, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather materials: You will need a wooden surface, the stencil, a sharp pencil, masking or painters tape, a ruler or T-square, a level (optional), and sandpaper. 2. Prepare the wooden surface: Begin by sanding the wooden surface with a light grit sandpaper (preferably 220 grit) to remove any rough spots or burrs and to achieve a smooth surface. Wipe off the dust with a damp cloth and let it dry completely. 3. Position the stencil: Position your stencil onto the wooden surface according to your desired design or alignment. You can use a ruler or T-square to ensure your stencil is straight. If necessary, use a level to double-check its alignment. 4. Secure the stencil: Once the stencil is properly positioned, use masking or painters tape to secure it in place. Make sure the stencil lies flat against the wooden surface and that there are no visible gaps or creases. 5. Trace the stencil: With a sharp pencil, apply moderate pressure to carefully trace the outline of the stencil design onto the wooden surface. Be sure to trace every detail and corner for an accurate and precise result. Hold the stencil securely while tracing to keep it from shifting. 6. Check your tracing: Once you have traced the entire stencil, remove it from the wood and check your tracing for completeness and accuracy. If any areas need touching up or clarification, do so carefully using the pencil. Double-check your tracing against the stencil to ensure it matches. 7. Apply the finish: Depending on your intended use for the wood, you can now proceed with painting, staining, or using a wood burning tool to complete the design. Option a) – tracing with a pencil – is preferred over option b) for several reasons. Pencils provide more precise and clean lines than crayons, which can create a waxy residue or blur the design.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  A team of hikers split into two groups.

Summarize this article: Class is a time to learn new things and solidify the information that you may have learned in the previous class. If you don’t go to class, it is much more difficult to stay current with the material.  Ask questions in class. Your teacher is there to make sure you have a solid grasp on the material. If you have a question, don’t hesitate to ask it. Some of the other students in the class likely have the same question. Prepare for class by reading the lesson you are going to cover ahead of time and know the formulas, theorems, and postulates by heart. Pay attention to your teacher while you are in class. You can talk to your classmates at break or after school. Geometry is the math of shapes and angles. To understand geometry, it is easier to visualize the problem and then draw a diagram. If you're asked about some angles, draw them. Relationships like vertical angles are much easier to see in a diagram; if one isn't provided, draw it yourself.  Understanding the properties of shapes and visualizing them is essential to succeeding in geometry. Practice recognizing shapes in various orientations and based on their geometric properties (the measure of angles, number of parallel and perpendicular lines, etc.). Study groups are a good way to learn the material and clarify concepts you don’t understand. Having a group that meets on a regular schedule will also force you to stay on top of the material and try your best to comprehend it. Studying with classmates is useful when you come to more difficult topics. You can work through them together to figure them out. One of your study mates may understand something that you don’t and help you out with it. You might also be able to help them understand something and learn it better by teaching them. A protractor is a semicircle-shaped tool used to measure the degree of an angle. It can also be used to draw angles. Knowing how to properly use a protractor is an essential skill in geometry. To measure the degree of an angle:  Align the center hole of the protractor over the vertex (center point) of the angle. Rotate the protractor until the baseline is on top of one leg of the angle. Extend the angle up to the arc of the protractor and record the degree it falls upon. This is the measurement of the angle. Homework is assigned because it helps you learn all of the concepts in the material. Doing the homework teaches you what you really understand and what topics you might need to put more time into. If you come across a topic in your homework that you are struggling with, focus on that topic until you understand it. Ask you classmates or your teacher to help you out. When you have a firm understanding of a topic or concept, you should be able to teach it to someone else. If you can’t explain it to them so that they also understand, you likely don’t get it as well as you thought either. Teaching material to others is also a good way to enhance your own memory or recall of the topic.  Try teaching your sibling or parent some geometry. Take the lead in a study group to explain something you know really well. Geometry is as much a skill as a branch of knowledge. Simply studying the rules of geometry will not be enough to get an A, you need to practice solving problems. This means doing your homework and working extra problems for any trouble areas.  Make sure to do as many practice problems as you can from other sources. Similar problems may be worded in a different way that might make more sense to you. The more problems you solve, the easier it will be to solve them in the future. Sometimes going to class and talking to your teacher just isn’t enough. You might need to find a tutor who has more time to focus specifically on what you are struggling with. Working with someone one-on-one can be very useful in understanding difficult material.  Ask your teacher if there are tutors available through the school. Attend any extra tutoring sessions held by your teacher and ask your questions. Summary:","output":"Attending class is crucial for staying up-to-date with the material and having the opportunity to ask questions to solidify understanding. Preparing for class by reading lesson materials beforehand and familiarizing oneself with formulas, theorems, and postulates is essential. In class, pay attention to the teacher and limit socializing until break or after school. Geometry involves understanding shapes and angles, which often requires visualization and drawing diagrams to comprehend problems more easily. Recognizing shapes and their properties, such as angles and lines, is critical for success in geometry. Participating in study groups can help clarify difficult concepts and ensure steady progress through the material. Collaborating with classmates on challenging topics benefits all parties, as different individuals may understand various aspects better than others. Using a protractor to measure angles accurately is a fundamental skill in geometry. To do so, align the protractor's center hole over the vertex of the angle, rotate it until the baseline is on one leg of the angle, extend the angle to the protractor's arc, and record the degree measurement. Homework is assigned to reinforce concepts and help learners identify areas that need improvement. If struggling with a topic, seek help from classmates or teachers. Teaching material to others is an effective way to reinforce one's understanding of the subject. Practicing problem-solving in geometry is essential for success, so completing homework and extra problems from various sources is highly recommended. If additional help is needed, consider seeking a tutor for one-on-one support, or attend extra tutoring sessions offered by teachers. Overall, remaining engaged in class, practicing problem-solving regularly, and seeking help when needed are key strategies for succeeding in geometry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

OPT:  (1). negative;  (2). positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .","output":"The given phrase \\"maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral\\" would be considered negative.  The phrase can be broken down into its constituent parts to gain a better understanding of its overall sentiment: 1. \\"Maladjusted\\": This term's meaning is \\"poorly or inadequately adjusted\\" in regards to a person's psychological or social adjustment. In the context of the given phrase, it refers to teenagers who are not able to integrate well with their environment, experiencing difficulties in adapting to social norms, and potentially displaying behavior deemed disruptive or harmful to themselves or others. 2. \\"Teens\\": This term refers to teenagers – individuals who are in their adolescence. Adolescence is a period of significant growth, development, and self-discovery, during which young individuals may face unique challenges, such as establishing and maintaining interpersonal relationships, coping with emotions, and finding their own identity. 3. \\"Downward\\": This term implies a negative or declining trajectory - a situation that is worsening or deteriorating over time. 4. \\"Narcotized\\": This term means \\"to treat with a narcotic, especially to relieve pain\\". In this context, however, it possibly refers to substance abuse by the teenagers, either as a coping mechanism for their perceived inadequacy or as a result of some other external factors. 5. \\"Spiral\\": This term implies a pattern of continuous loop or a cycle that feeds onto itself. The downward spiral may give the impression that these maladjusted teens are caught in a vicious loop of their negative behaviors and conditions, with potentially devastating consequences. Based on this analysis, it becomes clear that the phrase presents a negative situation. It is suggestive of young individuals who are struggling with their emotional and psychological well-being, engaging in self-destructive behaviors such as substance abuse and progressing into a detrimental loop. This instills a sense of concern for the well-being of the teenagers in question and highlights the importance of addressing the underlying issues causing their maladjustment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perhaps surprisingly, the U.K. is a leading light—benefiting despite Brexit in part from a bet on Bank of England support. Investment-grade sterling corporate bonds are up nearly 13% year to date in local-currency terms, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, outpacing the U.S. market, up 9.1%, and euro-denominated debt, up 5.9%. The market had a Brexit blip, but the steep drop in underlying government-bond yields limited the pain—although for foreign investors, the plunge in the pound has hurt a lot. Still, since the vote, corporate bond yields have fallen relative to gilt yields. The U.K. market ticks a lot of boxes. First, investment-grade corporate bonds are winners given the search for yield and uncertainty about growth. The sterling market offers an average yield of 2.4%. Second, the U.K. market is unusual in that it contains a lot of long-dated bonds. Indeed, 45% of Barclays ’ sterling corporate bond index matures in 10 years or more, versus 29% for U.S. corporates and less than 10% for Europe. Duration is powering returns here. And third, investors may be betting on the BOE buying bonds. The European Central Bank started buying corporate bonds in June; the bonds it is targeting have rallied, and now the laggards are starting to catch up, Citigroup strategists note. The gap between yields on euro-denominated nonfinancial corporate bonds and German government debt has narrowed 0.4 percentage point this year. After July’s inaction, expectations have built for this week’s BOE meeting. That has been spurred by policy makers like Andrew Haldane calling for a “muscular” easing package and former hawk Martin Weale shifting stance on stimulus and noting that asset purchases could be effective. That said, the BOE and the ECB face different situations. The fragmented nature of eurozone government bond markets constrains the ECB’s bond-purchase program. The BOE doesn’t face that worry. Indeed, back in 2009, the BOE briefly bought corporate bonds but abandoned the scheme as it ramped up purchases of gilts—where it could deliver a bigger program more quickly. A big problem for both the BOE and investors is a dearth of bonds. The Barclays corporate index contains £285 billion (377.03 billion) of bonds, making the market a relative minnow. It has hardly grown in recent years. That has been to investors’ benefit, helping to support prices. But the small size of the market makes it vulnerable to prices getting out of whack if a big buyer steps in. Investors might get a boost to returns—but they will get new worries too.

Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences. A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour. MS Alexandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \\"poet\\" or \\"writer\\" class). Station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour. The Pushkin Hills and Pushkin Lake were named in his honour in Ben Nevis Township, Cochrane District, in Ontario, Canada.

To make the text lower case, you can follow these steps: 1. Identify each character in the string: 'T', 'h', 'i', 's', ' ', 'e', 'x', 'p', 'e', 'r', 'i', 'e', 'n', 'c', 'e', ' ', 'o', 'c', 'c', 'u', 'r', 'r', 'e', 'd', ' ', 'o', 'n', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', ' ', 'S', 'u', 'n', ' ', '2', '2', ' ', 'A', 'u', 'g', ' ', '2', '0', '1', '0', ' ', '0', '0', ':', '0', '0'. 2. Process each character using a conditional logic to change upper case letters to lower case If the character is an upper case letter, add 32 to the ASCII value of the character, which is equivalent to converting the letter to its lower case counterpart. For example, the upper case letter 'A' has an ASCII value of 65, so adding 32 gives a value of 97, which is the ASCII value for the lower case 'a'.

Options: - car - tree - hardware store - lumberyard - boat The answer to this question is:","output":"boat Boats are one of the oldest and most likely models to be made of wood. The history of wooden boat construction goes back thousands of years, to ancient civilizations such as the Mesopotamians, Egyptians, and Phoenicians. Wood has been the primary material for boat building since ancient times due to its abundance, workability, and buoyancy.  In ancient Egypt, wooden boats played a crucial role in their society, not just as a means of transportation, but also as spiritual and religious symbols. From the iconic papyrus boats and reed rafts to larger vessels made from cedar, acacia, or sycamore, these wooden boats were indispensable for trade, fishing, and warfare. There are numerous examples of ancient Egyptian wooden boats, such as the Khufu Ship, which was discovered in 1954 near the Great Pyramid of Giza and estimated to be over 4,500 years old. The Khufu Ship is a prime example of ancient wooden boat craftsmanship, featuring sophisticated techniques like mortise-and-tenon joinery and a planked hull. Similarly, other ancient civilizations, such as the Phoenicians and Greeks, relied heavily on wooden boats for their maritime activities. The Phoenicians were expert shipbuilders and navigators who developed iconic designs like the galley, a warship powered by oars, and the bireme, which featured two levels of oars. They also built merchant vessels known as gauloi that were used for trade and transport. The Greeks improved upon these designs with the introduction of the trireme, a three-level oared warship, which played a vital role in the history of ancient Greece. In medieval Europe, the famous Viking longships were primarily built with a wooden clinker (overlap) construction. The Vikings' skill in crafting sturdy, fast, and highly maneuverable boats contributed significantly to their success as raiders, traders, and explorers. These longships enabled the Vikings to travel vast distances through the rivers and coastal waters of Europe, reaching as far as North America. In the age of sail, wooden ships continued to dominate sea travel and trade, with new designs like the caravel, galleon, and clipper ship emerging. Throughout the golden age of piracy, many infamous pirates sailed the seas on wooden vessels. Even though modern boats are now predominantly made of metal, fiberglass, and composite materials, wooden boats continue to hold an important place in our cultural history and are cherished by enthusiasts who value their beauty, craftsmanship, and enduring connection to the past. In the world of boat models and replicas, wooden boats remain popular as collectors' items and decorative pieces, reflecting the rich maritime history and tradition that they represent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: a. no. b. yes.","output":"The point of algebra and linear algebra can be analyzed separately, as they serve distinct purposes and applications in mathematics and real-world scenarios. Although related and overlapping at times, these two areas are not the same. So, the answer to the multi-choice problem would be: a. no To further elucidate, let's discuss each topic independently: 1. The point of algebra: Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for their manipulation. It is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics and includes everything from solving elementary equations to studying abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. Its primary function is to generalize arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to work with abstract entities, not just numbers. The main purpose of algebra is to help us understand and solve various types of mathematical problems. It provides a language for representing and describing mathematical relationships, allowing us to analyze and make predictions about diverse situations. Algebraic techniques can be used in various fields, including science, engineering, economics, and even social studies. It improves our problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and ease in dealing with abstract concepts. Some key applications of algebra include: a) Finding unknown values: Algebra allows us to solve equations, especially those with multiple variables or unknowns. b) Modeling and analyzing real-world situations: From evaluating different payment plans on a loan to predicting the future growth of a population, algebra can help us make informed decisions and solve practical problems. c) Developing new mathematical theories: Algebraic concepts, like polynomials, algebraic structures, and matrices, form the basis for many other advanced mathematical disciplines, including geometry, calculus, and number theory. 2. The point of linear algebra: Linear algebra is a specific branch of algebra that deals primarily with the study of linear equations, linear transformations, and vector spaces. The main goal of linear algebra is to understand how these concepts can be used to solve problems involving geometric relationships, linear combinations, and the behavior of multidimensional systems. While algebra deals mostly with equations and functions in a broad sense, linear algebra narrows the focus to the specific properties and behaviors of linear systems across multiple dimensions, using scalars, vectors, and matrices to represent and manipulate data. Linear algebra has a wide range of applications in various fields, such as: a) Signal processing: Linear transformations play an essential role in processing signals for various purposes, such as filtering, equalization, and image processing. b) Data science and machine learning: Linear algebra is crucial in managing and interpreting multidimensional datasets efficiently. It underpins optimization techniques, regression models, and numerous machine learning algorithms. c) Engineering and physics: Linear algebra helps solve systems of linear equations that arise in various disciplines, including structural analysis, fluid dynamics, and electric circuits. In summary, while both algebra and linear algebra have similarities, they are not the same. Algebra has broad applications and generalizes arithmetic operations, while linear algebra specifically targets linear systems and relationships across multiple dimensions. Together, they form an interconnected web of mathematical concepts and tools essential for understanding and solving a vast array of problems in our world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the fact that:  Better farming techniques and machines increased the food supply and the distribution of food.  Answer the question:   If a farmer learned worse farming techniques, they could expect to produce more or less food? Answer:","output":"If a farmer learned worse farming techniques, they could expect to produce less food. Good farming techniques are designed to maximize yield, or the amount of food produced per unit of land. They can include proper crop rotation to preserve soil nutrients, efficient irrigation, effective use of fertilizers, pest and disease control, and the use of high-yield crop varieties. On the other hand, poor or worse farming techniques might involve inefficient use of water, overuse or underuse of fertilizers, lack of crop rotation leading to soil depletion, or ineffective pest and disease control. These practices could lead to lower crop yield, thus, less food will be produced.  Moreover, the quality of the food produced might also decline, as worse farming techniques could lead to less healthy, lower-nutrient crops. This can be due to depleted soil nutrients or unhealthy growth conditions. Lastly, poor farming techniques may also negatively affect the distribution of food. This distribution can be impacted not only by the quantity of food produced, but also by how well the food can be stored and transported. If the produced crops are of poor quality, they may not store or transport as well, leading to greater losses and less efficient distribution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities.  - A railway gun, also called a railroad gun, is a large artillery piece, often surplus naval artillery, mounted on, transported by, and fired from a specially designed railway wagon. Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known are the large Krupp-built pieces used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The 38 cm Siegfried K ( E ) ( K - Kanone ( cannon ) , E - in Eisenbahnlafette ( on railroad mounting ) ) was a German World War II railway gun based on the 38 cm SK C / 34 naval gun that served as the main armament of the Bismarck - class battleships . Only four were produced .  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

In this case, the hypothesis is a simplified reformulation of the original premise. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve the same core idea — that Osag is expressing the fact that a regulation is not being followed. Analyzing the two statements, the premise \\"Obviously we have a regulation which is not being followed,' Osag said\\", clearly narrates that Osag says a certain regulation isn't being followed. In principle, the subject 'Osag' and his recognizable point that 'the regulation was not being followed' are present. Meanwhile, the hypothesis \\"Osag said the regulation was not being followed\\" also communicates the same message. It also suggests that Osag stated that a regulation is not being followed. Despite the difference in wording, both express the same essential point. The wording of the hypothesis is slightly different and perhaps less explicit about Osag's opinion towards the issue (the word 'obviously') compared to the premise. But, in essence, it paraphrases Osag's indication of a standard not being adhered to. Thus, exploring the context, it can be established that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise provided - if the premise is true (which we are assuming it is), then the hypothesis would also be true. It means that Osag's statement about the regulation not being followed can be inferred from the premise. The premise fully entails the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - Glam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a style of rock and pop music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter.

The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" /  ; or transliterated from English as  (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States.

It refers to a condition where individuals experience adverse reactions— ranging from mild to severe— upon exposure to fragrances or other strong odors. These reactions can range from headaches and dizziness to respiratory issues and even full-blown asthma attacks. But addressing scent sensitivity in your environment isn't simply about making special accommodations for one person; it's about fostering a respectful, more inclusive, and healthier space for everyone. This article will discuss ways to educate people on scent sensitivity and provide tips on how to create an accommodating environment. Scent Sensitivity Awareness Raising awareness about scent sensitivity is the first crucial step in addressing the situation and ensuring a comfortable environment for all. This begins with providing a clear explanation of the condition and emphasizing its impact on affected individuals. It's essential to clarify the seriousness of the symptoms and ensure everyone grasps their role in minimizing triggers for scent-sensitive individuals. One effective way to raise awareness is by sharing personal experiences. Encourage individuals with scent sensitivity to speak out about their challenges and experiences and share resources like articles, videos, and medical research on the subject. It’s through empathy and understanding that colleagues can grow to appreciate the complexities of living with scent sensitivity. Polite Requests In addition to fostering a broader understanding of scent sensitivity, it's crucial to make specific, polite requests for minimizing potential triggers. Encourage people to reduce or eliminate their use of strongly scented personal care products like perfumes, deodorants, and hair sprays. It's important to assure everyone that these requests are not judgments on their choices or habits, and that their cooperation benefits everyone in the long run. It may seem uncomfortable to approach coworkers about their choice of personal care products, but there are ways to frame the conversation professionally and constructively. Consider starting with a compliment, expressing your respect for their space and needs before making your request. Keep the focus on your personal condition, avoiding accusatory language or derogatory comments. Altering Work Environments In cases where scent sensitivity still persists after addressing personal care products, discuss with your boss the possibility of making changes to the work environment. This can include: 1. Improved ventilation: Ensuring proper airflow can considerably diminish the concentration of scents and potential irritants, making it easier to breathe for everyone. 2. Designating scent-free areas: Establish zones within the workplace where people are asked to refrain from wearing fragrances, providing a safer space for sensitive individuals. 3. Encouraging clean and tidy workspaces: A well-organized and clean workspace reduces allergens and potential triggers. 4. Implementing scent-free policies: Talk to your boss about establishing official guidelines for reducing scents at work. This can include specific policies restricting the use of certain products or recommending scent-free alternatives. Flexible Work Schedules Another option for accommodating scent-sensitive individuals is offering flexible work hours or telecommuting opportunities, if possible. These adjustments can help workers in avoiding peak times when colleagues might be more likely to apply fragrances, or allow them to work from home, minimizing the chances of adverse reactions. Conclusion Scent sensitivity is an issue deserving our collective attention and understanding. By fostering a culture of awareness throughout the workplace, politely requesting changes in personal habits, adapting work environments, and offering flexible work schedules, we can create spaces that respect the needs and well-being of each and every employee. In doing so, we make significant strides towards a more inclusive and comfortable working experience for all."},{"instruction":"Q: If I tell you that Poisonous substances can cause harm to living things, and ask you the question \\"poisonous substances can cause what to come to living things\\", is the correct answer \\"health\\"?

Options: - bouquet of flowers - trash can - pizza - sky - united states Answer:","output":"A bee would most likely appreciate a bouquet of flowers as a gift.  Bees are well-known for their essential role as pollinators in the ecosystem. Their primary food source comes from flowers, specifically the nectar and pollen they contain. By offering a bouquet of flowers as a gift, you are providing the bee with a food source rich in nutrients and energy, which is highly beneficial for their overall well-being. Flowers serve a dual purpose for bees: they provide sustenance in the form of nectar and pollen while also providing an opportunity for them to engage in the necessary process of pollination. When bees visit multiple flowers in search of food, they inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another, effectively facilitating the process of pollination. This process allows plants to produce seeds and reproduce, ensuring the survival of various plant species and consequently maintaining the diversity and stability of ecosystems. A bouquet of flowers would be the most suitable option when compared to the other choices. Trash cans, pizzas, the sky, and the United States are all largely irrelevant to a bee's biological needs, preferences, and natural behavior. 1. Trash can: Bees do not interact with trash cans and do not derive any nutritional or other benefits from these objects. 2. Pizza: Bees do not consume human food like pizza, as it does not contain the essential nutrients, nectar, or pollen that they need for sustenance. 3. Sky: While the sky is indeed a part of the bee's natural environment, it is far too vast and abstract to be considered a suitable gift for a bee. 4. United States: The United States is a geographical area and political entity, which has no direct relevance to the needs or preferences of individual bees. In conclusion, a bouquet of flowers would be the most appropriate and meaningful gift for a bee, as it caters to their primary needs, preferences, and natural behavior patterns. By offering a bouquet of flowers, you would not only be supporting the bee's dietary requirements but also their essential role as pollinators in the wider ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In January 2017, it was stated that the sixth season would end the main storyline, and for a seventh season, the series would be softly rebooted with a new storyline. Question: season 6 once upon a time last season?","output":"Season 6 of Once Upon a Time, an American fantasy-drama series that aired on ABC, was not technically the last season of the show; however, it did mark the end of the main storyline that had been followed since the series began. The sixth season was ordered on March 3, 2016, and premiered on September 25, 2016. It concluded on May 14, 2017, and during January 2017, it was announced that the show would be experiencing a significant change in format. While a seventh season did indeed follow, the series underwent a \\"soft reboot\\" with a fresh plot and some new characters joining the cast, departing from the main narrative that was utilized throughout the first six seasons. This change caused the seventh season of Once Upon a Time to be viewed differently than the previous installments, and in a way, it could be considered the start of a new chapter rather than a direct continuation of what viewers had seen before. The original storyline had revolved around the story of Emma Swan, played by Jennifer Morrison, a woman who discovers her familial connections to Storybrooke, Maine, a town filled with fairy-tale characters who have forgotten their true identities due to a curse. The primary narrative followed Emma, her family, friends, and foes navigating through various adventures as they unraveled their true identities and faced numerous challenges along the way. In season six, major story arcs and characters' arcs were brought to a conclusion, and this season had a sense of finality to it. With the story wrapping up, the seventh season was given the green light to start anew, providing fans with a new set of adventures to immerse themselves in. The soft reboot allowed the show to take a different direction, attracting both old fans and newcomers alike, and giving the series the opportunity to explore new narratives within the realm of fairy tales and classic stories. In summary, while season six of Once Upon a Time was not the official last season, it did signify the end of the main storyline that fans had been engrossed in since the series' inception. The seventh season, with its soft reboot and fresh storyline, can be considered a separate entity that moved away from the earlier narrative arc, making the sixth season a fitting conclusion to the original story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Which of the following is not a type of division in Libya: regional, entrenched, or tribal? Context: Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.

In fact, it isn't that bad. High school is a lot like middle school after a while. The first day of course is always scary, and the first day of middle school must have been the same. Of course, the first few days you might get lost while looking for your classes but after a while, what seemed to be a large school really isn't.

Question: Where does Barnes barges into and asks to view their footage? Movie title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Dallas Chief of Police David Brown told CNN Sunday that the slain gunman told police negotiators he wanted to \\"kill white people, especially white officers.\\" Bomb making materials and a journal were found at Johnson's home during a search Friday. \\"The material were such that it was large enough to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area,\\" Brown said.

Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest. Police defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted.

Write an article based on this summary: – As the world comes to terms with the sudden and incredibly unusual resignation of the papacy by Pope Benedict XVI, the general consensus appears to be that Joseph Ratzinger was a scholarly, introverted conservative who will ultimately be remembered most for the controversies that surrounded him. Among the opinions: Despite trying twice, Benedict was never able to tame the wild and Byzantine Vatican bureaucracy. \\"The pope's failure to establish a grip on the Curia was to cost him dear, all the more because he showed a marked reluctance to consult others,\\" writes John Hooper in the Guardian, noting the Church bureaucracy is actually larger and more complex than it was at the start of his tenure. Another failed goal: \\"to launch the re-evangelization of Europe\\"; instead, sex-abuse scandals overtook the continent. After the charismatic, 26-year reign of John Paul II, Benedict \\"never had a chance,\\" writes John Moody for Fox News. In contrast to John Paul II's popular brilliance and willingness to show off, \\"Benedict’s meek initial outings were public relations meltdowns.\\" Other goals for the Church—to \\"expand its foothold in Asia, cement its dominance in Latin America, or make serious inroads in Africa\\"—went unachieved. But Moody adds that Benedict's willingness to resign shows both bravery and humility. \\"For that he should be remembered.\\" Actually, Benedict could end up with a legacy of dealing with the secular world in \\"a remarkably liberal, if agonizingly slow, way,\\" writes Martin Baccardax for the International Business Times.

The resignation presents a chance for the Church to \\"deal with sex-abuse victims more honestly, and to wake up and listen to the parishioners who have been widely ignoring Church teaching for decades,\\" writes Michael Tomasky in the Daily Beast. \\"But I would imagine it's an opportunity the Church won't take.\\" Click to see a list of five names being floated as the potential next pope. Article:","output":"Title: The Unusual Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI: Legacy of Controversies and Unachieved Goals The sudden and unexpected resignation of Pope Benedict XVI continues to unsettle the world as we attempt to come to terms with his decision and the legacy he leaves behind. Described as a scholarly, introverted conservative, Joseph Ratzinger’s tenure as Pope was marked by controversies, some of which overshadowed his goals for the Catholic Church. One significant criticism is Pope Benedict XVI's inability to establish control over the Vatican bureaucracy, despite two attempts. As noted by John Hooper in the Guardian, this failure was costly, particularly since he was averse to consulting with others. At the end of his tenure, the bureaucracy had grown larger and more complex than before, leading to further mismanagement and difficulties.  Another unachieved goal was the effort to re-evangelize Europe. Instead, sex-abuse scandals on the continent overshadowed and impeded progress in the Church. Pope Benedict XVI had the unenviable task of following John Paul II, whose popular and charismatic 26-year reign contrasted sharply with the new pontiff's more humble demeanor. As John Moody wrote for Fox News, Benedict “never had a chance.” In terms of expanding the Church’s presence in Asia, consolidating dominance in Latin America, or making significant inroads in Africa, progress again fell short. However, Moody adds that Benedict's courage to resign exhibited both bravery and humility, which should be remembrance-worthy. An interesting point by Martin Baccardax in the International Business Times is that Benedict's legacy might be defined by his slow but liberal approach to addressing secular issues. The Pope took tentative steps towards changing the Church's stance on contraception and criticized its response to the global child-abuse scandal. Hooper also remarks that Benedict's comments on condoms could be \\"the most significant initiative of [his] papacy.\\" Despite these attempts, some are not convinced that Pope Benedict XVI deserves credit in those areas. The Pope's resignation has provided the Church with an opportunity to address sex-abuse victims more honestly and acknowledge parishioners' perspectives. However, Michael Tomasky in the Daily Beast remains skeptical that the Church will seize this chance. As Benedict's papacy ends, his legacy is marked by controversies and unachieved goals. His resignation offers the Catholic Church a potential turning point, presenting the institution with the challenge of addressing pressing issues and evolving for the better. All eyes are now turned to the Vatican, as discussions of potential candidates for the next Pope ensue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Investitionen in Verkehrs- und Energienetze schaffen unmittelbar neue Arbeitsplätze und stärken die Voraussetzungen für unternehmerische Tätigkeit auch in entlegenen und hinter der Entwicklung zurückgebliebenen Regionen. Translate to English","output":"Investments in transportation and energy networks immediately create new jobs and strengthen the prerequisites for entrepreneurial activity, even in remote and underdeveloped regions. Investments in transportation and energy networks indicate a forward-thinking approach to infrastructure development. They not only generate new jobs but make distant or underdeveloped regions accessible to entrepreneurial activities. By doing this, they open up a wealth of opportunities for economic growth, and can help catalyze the overall development of these regions. Investments in transportation, for example, include the development and improvement of roads, bridges, ports, airports, and transit systems. These investments immediately create jobs in sectors like construction, engineering, planning, and management, among others. Furthermore, improved transportation networks provide greater access to markets, improve the flow of goods and services, and make it easier for people to travel to work or to find jobs in other regions.  Similarly, investments in energy networks, such as renewable energy plants, the electrical grid, or natural gas pipelines, can also create jobs in their construction and operation. When you consider the additional employment created in support industries and the multiplier effect on the wider economy, the job creation potential is considerable. Moreover, they ensure the availability of reliable and sustainable power supplies, which is a critical element of any thriving economy.  By nurturing entrepreneurship, these investments can also stimulate innovative businesses, bring about economic diversification, and play a significant role in regional development. Entrepreneurs will find opportunities to start and grow businesses in areas like logistics, tourism, or local trade, resulting in more job creation and socio-economic growth.  In sum, investments in transportation and energy networks do much more than create jobs immediately; they lay the groundwork for long-term economic resilience and growth, particularly in regions that would otherwise be left behind. By connecting villages to cities, they can bring about equitable development, mitigating regional disparities, promoting social inclusion, and enhancing the quality of life in these remote or underdeveloped regions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These changes are taken into consideration in vaccine development. Many infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of vaccines. Immunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and study allergies or other immune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems (diseases in which a person’s immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS) or hereditary (such as severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists are called in to help treat organ transplantation patients, who must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. Some immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person’s environment on it. Others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases such as cancer. In the past, the importance of having a healthy immune system in preventing cancer was not at all understood. To work as an immunologist, a PhD or MD is required. In addition, immunologists undertake at least 2–3 years of training in an accredited program and must pass an examination given by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology.

Similarities: - Both sentences mention a \\"new\\" virus/coronavirus. - Both sentences use \\"can probably\\" in reference to the virus passing between people. - Both sentences refer to \\"passing person to person\\" for the virus's transmission mode. - Both sentences mention the World Health Organization (WHO) as the source of information. Differences: - Sentence 1 uses \\"coronavirus\\" while sentence 2 uses \\"virus\\". - Sentence 1 uses \\"passed\\" while sentence 2 uses \\"pass\\". Step 3: Assign a similarity score on a scale from 0 to 5 based on the comparison. Given the similarities and differences between the two sentences, I would assign a similarity score of 4. While there are minor differences in word choice, both sentences convey the same meaning and overall message. Therefore, they are quite similar but not identical."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire. Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler (we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor's tax return) who, sensing that the future is in computers, poses (by means of a deft piece of identity theft) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an American multinational. Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is on top form, as is the delightful Maggie Smith, here unusually cast as an accident-prone cockney-sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy as Ustinov and Newhart's womanising boss. What do I particularly like about this film? Not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie' but it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective.) So, what is there not to like? Well, the script is no more computer-literate than most films (that is, hardly at all) even though it captures the feel of late '60s 'big iron' business computing quite well. Also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing, but I consider these to be minor niggles.

Veteran journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed women while he was in a powerful position at ABC News, according to five women who shared their previously undisclosed accounts with CNN and others who did not experience the alleged harassment personally, but were aware of it.      \\"During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me,\\" Halperin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday night. \\"I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\\"      MSNBC, where Halperin makes frequent appearances on \\"Morning Joe,\\" said early Thursday that Halperin would leave his roles at that network and as an analyst at NBC News.      \\"We find the story and the allegations very troubling,\\" MSNBC said in a statement. \\"Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.\\"      Widely considered to be one of the preeminent political journalists, Halperin, 52, has, among other career highlights, been political director at ABC News; co-authored the bestselling book \\"Game Change,\\" which was made into an HBO movie starring Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin; and anchored a television show on Bloomberg TV. He is featured in Showtime's \\"The Circus,\\" a show that chronicled the 2016 campaign cycle and the early days of the Trump presidency, and has a project in development with HBO, which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.      But women who spoke to CNN say he also had a dark side not made public until now. The stories of harassment shared with CNN range in nature from propositioning employees for sex to kissing and grabbing one's breasts against her will. Three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halperin as, without consent, pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed. Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and pressing his genitals against the three women.      Related: The (incomplete) list of powerful men accused of sexual harassment after Harvey Weinstein      The women who worked with Halperin and who spoke with CNN did not report to Halperin. However, Halperin made many decisions about political coverage at ABC News, and had a voice in some critical personnel decisions. None of the women have said, though, that he ever promised anything in exchange for sex, or suggested that he would retaliate against anyone.      Still, while they no longer work with him, Halperin continues to wield influence in politics and media. The women who spoke to CNN said it was for this reason that they shared their accounts on the condition of anonymity. Others also said they still feel embarrassed about what happened to them and did not want to be publicly associated with it.      \\"Mark left ABC News over a decade ago, and no complaints were filed during his tenure,\\" ABC News said in a statement provided to CNN after this article was published.      The first woman told CNN she was invited to visit his office in the early 2000s, when he was political director at ABC News, to have a soda, and said that while she was there with him he forcibly kissed her and pressed his genitals against her body.      \\"I went up to have a soda and talk and -- he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs,\\" the woman said. \\"I just froze. I didn't know what to do.\\"      When she did make her way out of his office, the woman told a friend at ABC News what had happened. That friend told CNN she remembered the woman telling her about the incident and seeing her visibly shaken.      The second woman, another former ABC News employee, described a similar experience in his office during the 2004 campaign cycle. This woman said she was around 25 years old then, and wanted to be a \\"campaign off-air\\" -- ABC News' term for one of the reporters who travel embedded with presidential campaigns -- so she reached out to Halperin, who was a part of the decision-making process regarding those assignments at the time.      \\"The first meeting I ever had with him was in his office and he just came up from behind -- I was sitting in a chair from across his desk -- and he came up behind me and [while he was clothed] he pressed his body on mine, his penis, on my shoulder,\\" this woman told CNN. \\"I was obviously completely shocked. I can't even remember how I got out of there -- [but] I got out of there and was freaked out by that whole experience. Given I was so young and new I wasn't sure if that was the sort of thing that was expected of you if you wanted something from a male figure in news.\\"      The woman said Halperin continued to express a sexual desire for her in subsequent visits, despite being rebuffed.      \\"It was more like him coming up too close to me and sort of along the lines of hugging me,\\" she explained.      She also alleged that Halperin propositioned her for sex on the campaign trail.      \\"He would say, 'Why don't you meet me upstairs?' And I would say, 'That's not a good idea.' And he would push the request further,\\" the person said. \\"Eventually I would just ignore him and go about my business.\\"      One of the woman's friends has told CNN that the woman told her about the first incident, in Halperin's office. She said her friend had told her some time after the incident that Halperin had pressed his genitals against her while she was seated in his office, but did not recall being told about unwanted touching during subsequent visits or the alleged propositions for sex.      A third woman, also a former ABC News employee, told CNN she was on the road with Halperin when he propositioned her.      \\"I excused myself to go to the bathroom and he was standing there when I opened the door propositioning [me] to go into the other bathroom to do something,\\" she said. \\"It freaked me out. I came out of the ladies' room and he was just standing there. Like almost blocking the door.\\"      A fourth woman who worked with Halperin and was junior to him told CNN he once asked her late at night on the campaign trail to go up to his hotel room with him, and that she believed him to be propositioning her. She declined.      The fifth woman who spoke to CNN was not an ABC News employee at the time of the incident she alleges. She was not comfortable sharing specifics of her story for publication, but said Halperin, while clothed, placed his erect penis against her body without consent.      The women who spoke to CNN said that they did not report Halperin's behavior to management either because they feared retribution, given the level of power Halperin had at ABC and in the industry, or because they were embarrassed. In some cases, their fear of him and the sway he holds remains to this day.      The woman in the first account, however, said she told a mentor at ABC News who said he wanted to escalate the issue to management. It is unclear if that ever occurred.      CNN's investigation found that Halperin allegedly exhibited this type of behavior from the 1990s to the mid-2000s. CNN has not learned of any incidents after Halperin left ABC News.      Halperin joined ABC News in the late 1980s. In 1997 Halperin was named political director of ABC News, and rose to prominence with the advent of The Note, a morning digest newsletter previewing the day in politics. The Note became a must-read for industry professionals, and it catapulted him to the upper echelons of the political scene.      Halperin left ABC News in 2007 for Time magazine and joined Bloomberg in 2014 for a reported salary of 1 million. At Bloomberg, he co-anchored \\"With All Due Respect\\" with journalist John Heilemann. The show was simulcast on MSNBC for a period.      Related: Mark Halperin leaves Bloomberg      Halperin also found great success writing books. In 2010, he co-authored \\"Game Change\\" with Heilemann. The duo later published \\"Double Down: Game Change 2012,\\" reportedly receiving a multi-million dollar advance. Halperin and Heilemann are currently working on a third installment about the 2016 election.      \\"For the last 11 years, I have had to watch this guy find success in every other news organization,\\" one of the women who said she experienced harassment told CNN.      The allegations against Halperin come weeks after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was first publicly accused of sexual harassment and assault -- allegations that have prompted multiple police departments to launch investigations, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts to expel him, and his firing from the company he co-founded. (Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual acts.)      While the allegations against Halperin do not mirror the allegations against Weinstein, the fact that the women who spoke with CNN have chosen to do so now does reflect the larger discussion in entertainment, media, politics and other industries since the Weinstein scandal began. Women -- and men -- are talking about things that have long been rumored but have never been brought to light. Some people are feeling emboldened to tell those stories now. Others are looking back and regretting the things they didn't do.      One person who formerly worked with Halperin told CNN that while they were not aware of the extent of the alleged harassment, they believe they had heard enough to warrant reporting the whispers to management.      \\"In retrospect, I was such a coward,\\" the person said. \\"I wish I said something. I wish I had done something.\\" ||||| Mark Halperin, a senior political analyst and frequent contributor for NBC News and MSNBC, acknowledged Wednesday night that he had engaged in \\"inappropriate\\" behavior around women he worked with while he was at ABC News and said he would \\"take a step back from my day-to-day work.\\"      Halperin apologized for having pursued \\"relationships with women that [he] worked with\\" in a statement to CNN, which quoted five anonymous women, four of them former ABC News employees, as saying Halperin sexually harassed them when he was a top political journalist at ABC News.      \\"During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me,\\" Halperin told CNN. \\"I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain.

Write a summary based on this article: Twitter suspended the account of Guy Adams, a journalist and critic of NBC's Olympic coverage, for posting the corporate email of an NBC executive. (Twitter)      Criticism of NBC's 2012 Olympics coverage has been rampant on Twitter since the Games' opening ceremony Friday, but Sunday evening, one of the biggest critics found his Twitter account suspended.      Guy Adams, a journalist who's written about NBC's coverage, had been tweeting up a storm, which you can see here, presenting NBC in a bad manner. But the last straw finally came when Adams tweeted out the following:      \\"The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven't started yet is Gary Zenkel. Tell him what u think! Email: Gary.zenkel@nbcuni.com\\"      Adams was referring to Gary Zenkel, the president of NBC Olympics, and NBC wasn't having it. The company reported Adams' tweet, and some time later, Adams' account was suspended and has stayed down since.      It's \\"quite worrying that NBC, whose parent company are an Olympic sponsor, are apparently trying (and, in this case, succeeding) in shutting down the Twitter accounts of journalists who are critical of their Olympic coverage,\\" Adams wrote to Twitter, according to a piece put online by the Independent on Monday.      But while it can be easy to assume Twitter is just looking out for its Olympic partner, its Terms of Service arguably do appear to back up its actions.      The company states online that \\"Posting another person’s private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter Rules.\\" In another page, Twitter says \\"If the account is violating our policy, then you can file a report and we will investigate the account. If the account is in violation, we will suspend the account.\\"      That all seems to support its action, but is a corporate email address considered private information? Well, on that first page, Twitter lists a couple of examples of private information, which include:      credit card information      social security or other national identity numbers      addresses or locations that are considered and treated as private      non-public, personal phone numbers      non-public, personal email addresses      There's no mention of corporate or professional emails, and Deadspin, which has been reporting the story, says the emails of NBC executives are easy to determine since they're all a basic \\"first.last@nbcuni.com\\" format.      But in its Terms of Service, Twitter alludes that information is considered private if it isn't listed online, and from what I could find, Zenkel's email was not public prior to Monday.      [Updated, 4:20 p.m. July 30: A reader pointed out this Web page dated June 2011 that lists Zenkel's email. It's not a prominent website, but it does list Zenkel's email, which now seems to tilt the argument Adams' way.]      Twitter has declined to comment, saying its policy is not to comment about individual users. And I haven't been able to reach Adams for further comment on his part, but it may not be long before Adams' Twitter account is back up because Twitter has told him he simply needs to confirm that he has read and understands Twitter's policy.      Regardless, Adams is right about his suspension being worrying.      It's not that the suspension is all that bad. Twitter suspends accounts every day, but the fact that this suspension is more of a judgment call than an exact science is disturbing.      Twitter and NBC are partners, and friends tend to watch each others' backs. So if you have been criticizing NBC and plan to continue doing so, it may be best to make sure you aren't violating Twitter's policies -- you don't want to find your account down the next time you try to log on.

UPDATED      Twitter has suspended the account of a British journalist who tweeted the corporate email address of an NBC executive. The reporter, Guy Adams of the Independent, has been acerbic in his criticisms of NBC’s (awful) performance during the Olympics in London.      Adams has posted his correspondence with Twitter, which claims he posted a private email address. It was nothing of the kind, as many including Deadspin have pointed out. (Here’s the policy, which Adams plainly did not violate, since the NBC executive’s email address was already easily discernible on the Web — NBC has a firstname.lastname@ system for its email, and it’s a corporate address, not a personal one — and was publicly published over a year ago.)      What makes this a serious issue is that Twitter has partnered with NBC during the Olympics. And it was NBC’s complaint about Adams that led to the suspension.      Twitter has been exemplary in its handling of many issues over the past several years, including its (for a social network) brave stance in protecting user privacy. So I’m giving the service the benefit of the doubt for the moment, and hoping that this is just a foolish — if well-meaning — mistake by a single quick-triggered Twitter employee. If so, Twitter should apologize and reinstate Adams’ account immediately. If it does so, there’s little harm done — and the company will have learned a lesson.      If not, this is a defining moment for Twitter. It will have demonstrated that it can be bullied by its business partners into acts that damage its credibility and ultimately the reason so many of us use it as a platform. And if that’s the case, there will be much less incentive to use it.

Guy Adams, this newspaper's Los Angeles correspondent, was removed from the social networking site on the day that he wrote a news story detailing widespread public complaints about the network's coverage of the London Games.      According to Twitter, he was suspended for a message posted during the Opening Ceremony, when NBC prevented viewers of America from watching live coverage, so that the network could screen the occasion during an evening prime-time slot coveted by advertisers. \\"The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven't started yet is Gary Zenkel,\\" wrote Mr Adams. \\"Tell him what * think!\\" His tweet then contained the work email address of Mr Zenkel, the President of NBC Olympics.      Twitter claimed last night that the tweet breached its guidelines.      \\"Your account has been suspended for posting an individual's private information such as private email address, physical address, telephone number, or financial documents,\\" the company informed Mr Adams. \\"It is a violation of the Twitter Rules.\\"      In response, Mr Adams wrote: \\"I didn't publish a private email address, just a corporate one, which is widely available to anyone with access to Google and is identical to one that all of the tens of thousands of NBC Universal employees share. It's no more 'private' than the address I'm emailing you from right now.      \\"Either way, [it's] quite worrying that NBC, whose parent company is an Olympic sponsor, is apparently trying (and, in this case, succeeding) in shutting down the Twitter accounts of journalists who are critical of their Olympic coverage.\\"      News of the suspension sparked tens of thousands of angry messages on Twitter, including comments supportive of Mr Adams from BBC journalist Jeremy Vine, and Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily Mirror who now works for CNN. The novelist Irvine Welsh posted the the following comment online: \\"The Guy Adams twitter ban illustrates three tendencies of hegemonic power; 1) hates criticism, 2) takes itself seriously 3) no sense of fun,\\" tweeted.      In a statement, NBC said: \\"We filed a complaint with Twitter because a user tweeted the personal information of one of our executives.\\"      What exactly did Guy Adams have to say? Plenty.

Twitter and NBC are forming a partnership for the Olympics, as the microblogging site hopes to use the Games as a way to build its following and prove itself as a money-making, sustainable business. Shara Tibken reports on digits. Photo: Getty Images.      There, a handful of people will spend 20 hours a day to help corral millions of Twitter messages from Olympic athletes, their families, fans and NBC television personalities into a single page on Twitter.com.      Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images The London Eye Ferris wheel will light up each night based on tweets.      Twitter's Olympics hub, part of a partnership between the San Francisco company and Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal that will be announced as early as Monday, is one of the first times Twitter will serve as an official narrator for a live event. NBC will tout the website with on-air promotions and links to athlete interviews or video clips.      With the partnership, Twitter hopes to use the Olympics as a launch pad into a more sustainable business. Twitter, which allows people to post 140-character messages called tweets, has built up more than 140 million monthly users and has become a go-to resource for people to find news or to gab about \\"American Idol.\\"      But executives want the six-year-old service to find a larger audience, especially amid doubts about Twitter's ability to become a serious money maker.      Research firm eMarketer Inc. estimates Twitter will generate 259.9 million from advertising this year—far less than Facebook Inc.'s 3.15 billion in 2011 revenue. Wider adoption can help Twitter expand its ad business, justify its 8.4 billion valuation and eventually pave the way for an initial public offering.      As a result, Twitter's Olympics bet is crucial. \\"This is a way for new users to sample Twitter,\\" said Chloe Sladden, Twitter's vice president of media.      NBC said no money is changing hands in its Twitter partnership and that it won't share in revenue from ads that Twitter is selling to Olympics sponsors for its Games website. Brands such as General Electric Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. already have bought ads on Twitter to promote their association with the Olympics.

P&G didn't return a request for comment. GE said it expects \\"the 2012 Games to be a pinnacle of social activity.\\"      \\"There's no way of knowing exactly how much advertisers will spend on Twitter during the Olympics, but there is no doubt they will be jockeying for ad space during some of the key events of the Games, when traffic on Twitter will explode,\\" eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said.      Twitter has prepared for the Games for months. The company has hosted dozens of sessions with athletes and national sports associations to pitch them on using its service. Twitter has courted companies to buy ads on Twitter to spread their Olympics marketing messages. The International Olympic Committee said well over 1,000 current and former Olympians are using Twitter or Facebook for the Games.      Advertisers said Twitter has pushed itself to them as an effective marketing vehicle. Athletes and Olympics organizations said that ever since the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, there has been an explosion of athletes embracing Twitter to talk to fans and occasionally trash talk to rivals.      During the Games, Twitter will use its Olympics events page to highlight insiders' views, and to encourage people to watch NBC's on-air and online coverage. Twitter will embed its own staffer with NBC's social media team in London to ensure fresh news, interviews and links to TV highlights will show up on Twitter. The Olympics \\"hashtag\\"—a way for Twitter to organize tweets about a single topic—will pop up on screen during television coverage, NBC said.      Twitter will be visible offline as well, not just on TV or online. The London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel dominating the skyline, will light up each night based on the sentiment of Olympic tweets, although Twitter said that isn't part of its campaign.      Some research shows social media is fueling viewership of live TV, as people want to interact over Kobe Bryant's dunk or Angelina Jolie's Oscar dress. Social-media analysis firm Trendrr said Twitter accounted for an average of three quarters of the \\"social activity\\" around broadcast TV programs in the first quarter of this year, vs. 16% for Facebook. For sports or other major televised events, Trendrr found Twitter has a near-lock on digital conversations.      Twitter believes the Olympics partnership with NBC is a chance to cement that status. It means \\"Twitter is really where the party is,\\" Ms. Sladden said.      Facebook, which has a similar events page launched in conjunction with NBC, isn't selling ads there tied to the Olympics. Facebook declined to comment.      It is unclear if the interests of Twitter and NBC will always align during the Games. NBC plans to contain highlight clips and other Olympics video on its own websites and mobile applications, which won't necessarily appear on other digital services. Twitter also may tread on NBC's turf by essentially programming the Olympics on its events page.      Twitter and NBC said they aren't in competition. NBC's Olympics president, Gary Zenkel, said Olympics coverage anywhere helps NBC by stoking viewer interest.      \\"We're quite aware of and comfortable with the fact that [Twitter] is a place where news will surface, and in some cases the news will be made,\\" said Mr. Zenkel. \\"At the end of the day, the only place you can watch the Olympics—which is what people crave—is NBC.\\"      Meanwhile, Ms. Sladden said she would be in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters during the Games, closely watching the coverage. \\"I'll be consuming tweets and tweeting—and maybe trying to get some work done,\\" Ms. Sladden said.

He shared the email of an NBC executive, Gary Zenkel, and told people to email Gary if they thought badly of the coverage too. NBC didn't like this, so they reported Guy Adams' tweet. Later, his Twitter account was suspended. Some people think this is wrong, but Twitter's rules say you can't share someone's private information. It is not clear if a corporate email is considered private or not.

Obsession comes in many flavors, and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it may be an avenue of survival. Lack of nurturing, combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements, may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession, driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing, and as we discover in \`The Luzhin Defence,' directed by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and in fact, may actually exacerbate the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; moreover, it gives no quarter. \\tAt an Italian resort in the 1920's, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the World Champion. Luzhin is a Master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family. So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament. That man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), Luzhin's former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin. \\tValentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson). And, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life. \\tTo tell Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life. For the scenes of his childhood, Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort. The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well. She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making Luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling. \\tThe single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of John Turturro. For this film to work, Luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. It doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life. He captures Luzhin's genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real. It's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of David Helfgott in \`Shine.' And when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from Sid Lidz in \`Unstrung Heroes' to Pete in \`O Brother Where Art Thou?' to Al Fountain in \`Box of Moonlight,' you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is. \\tAs Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin, Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. Most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story. You have but to look into Watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real. It's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor. \\tThe supporting cast includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzhin's Father), Kelly Hunter (Luzhin's Mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well crafted and delivered, \`The Luzhin Defence' is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man. We don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of one of Massenet's last students?  Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Bruneau, Charpentier, Chausson,... A:","output":"One of Massenet's last students was Camille Saint-Saëns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, son of the Zulu king Cetshwayo, was exiled at St Helena between 1890 and 1897. Diphtheria broke out in 1887 and also in 1893 which, with an additional outbreak of whooping cough, led to the death of 31 children under 10.

A submarine cable en route to Britain from Cape Town was landed in November 1899 and extended to Ascension by December and was operated by the Eastern Telegraph Company. For the next two years over six thousand Boer prisoners were imprisoned at Deadwood and Broadbottom. The population reached its all-time record of 9,850 in 1901. Although a number of prisoners died, being buried at Knollcombes, the islanders and Boers developed a relationship of mutual respect and trust, a few Boers choosing to remain on the island when the war ended in 1902. A severe outbreak of influenza in 1900 led to the death of 3.3% of the population, although it affected neither the Boer prisoners nor the troops guarding them.

It was produced by Harvey Levin Productions, and directed by Brad Kreisburg. It was hosted by Holly Herbert and Carlos Diaz.   - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in May or June.  - As the World Turns (often referred to as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010.

Premise: \\"oh it isn't bad\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"It's not terrible.\\" true?","output":"In order to analyze this premise and hypothesis, we first need to break down the components and understand the meanings of the terms used. Premise: \\"oh it isn't bad\\" The premise is a statement expressing a personal opinion or judgment that something is not of poor quality or undesirable. In this case, the speaker is expressing that \\"it\\" isn't bad, meaning that they believe \\"it\\" to be at least of satisfactory quality or acceptable. Hypothesis: \\"It's not terrible.\\" The hypothesis is a proposed explanation or statement assuming that \\"it\\" is not terrible. In this context, \\"terrible\\" usually implies something very bad or having poor quality. Now that we have a better understanding of the premise and hypothesis, let's analyze the relationship between the two statements. The opinion expressed in the premise that \\"it isn't bad\\" suggests that the quality or condition of \\"it\\" is not bad or poor. On the other hand, the hypothesis is stating that \\"it\\" is not terrible, which also implies that the quality or condition of \\"it\\" is not extremely poor. In general, the meaning of \\"terrible\\" is more extreme than \\"bad,\\" as \\"terrible\\" usually denotes something of very low quality, extremely undesirable, or causing distress. However, based on the speaker's judgment that \\"it isn't bad\\" in the premise, one can infer that they find \\"it\\" to be at least tolerable or adequate. The hypothesis, in turn, does not make an affirmative claim about the quality of \\"it.\\" Instead, it just states that \\"it\\" is not terrible, or in other words, not extremely low in quality or causing distress. Considering how both statements refer to the underlying quality or acceptability of the subject, it appears that the hypothesis \\"It's not terrible\\" is consistent with the premise \\"oh it isn't bad.\\" While both statements are made in the negative, they collectively convey that \\"it\\" is neither bad nor terrible, positioning \\"it\\" within a range of acceptability or adequacy. However, it is important to note that the premise is an expression of personal opinion or judgment, and might not hold true for everyone. There may be individual differences in perception or interpretation regarding what constitutes as \\"bad\\" or \\"terrible.\\" In conclusion, based on the premise \\"oh it isn't bad,\\" it is reasonable to deduce that the hypothesis \\"It's not terrible\\" is true. Both statements share similarities in presenting a common point that the subject is not of extremely low quality or undesirable. However, individual opinions and experiences may vary, which could influence one's perception of the underlying acceptability or adequacy of the subject in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks: The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head. They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation. The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed. But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long period of decline. The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year.

He turned a seesaw into a big ship and the sandbox into a treasure island.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Matthias has rallied people from all over the planet in their fight against the powerful and tyrannical Cohaagan, the planet's dictator, and his military forces known as The Enforcers. Cohaagan has enjoyed unchallenged rule over Terrastra for decades, harnessing the planet's rare mineral resources for his own benefit and propagandizing the usefulness of his regime. As the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished deepens, the unrest surrounding Matthias' movement reaches its boiling point. One fateful day, however, Matthias is found dead in his safe house, sparking chaos and confusion amongst The Flux. Who could have gotten to their fiercely protected leader? Almost immediately, fingers point towards Cohaagan and his Enforcers as the masterminds behind the assassination. Seeking to unravel the truth, Dana Gray, a young, talented investigator within The Flux, and Noah Kash, a former Enforcer with a disdain for Cohaagan's brutal regime, forge an unexpected alliance to uncover who killed Matthias. Rumors and speculations spread like wildfire, inciting chaos and mistrust among the people, which ultimately plays into Cohaagan's hands. No stone is left unturned as Dana and Noah delve deep into the world of espionage, government surveillance, and back-alley deals, revealing the complexities of resistance and the corruption entrenched within Cohaagan's heinous empire. They gradually unearth that Matthias' assassination may have resulted from a vast conspiracy infiltrated by a double agent from within the heart of The Flux. As Dana and Noah get closer to identifying the mole, they stumble upon a shocking revelation that implicates some of the most trusted individuals within The Flux, triggering a struggle for power and trust within the movement. Meanwhile, they uncover that Cohaagan had orchestrated part of this intricate web of deceit in an attempt to eliminate Matthias, who had stumbled upon an explosive secret that could topple Cohaagan's reign. With time running short and Cohaagan's forces closing in on them, Dana and Noah must race to reveal the shocking truth about Matthias' death, the identity of the mole, and the explosive secret that threatens not just Cohaagan's rule but the very existence of Terrastra itself. In the climax of the story, our heroes finally expose the mole, dismantle Cohaagan's plan to control Terrastra, and bring retribution for the murder of Matthias. As Terrastra emerges into a new age with a chance at a democratic government, it also faces ongoing challenges in reconciling the rifts left behind by years of Cohaagan's rule.

It was discovered in 1918 near the temple of Dendera on the west bank of the Nile and acquired by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo – but its significance has only just been realised. Now researchers believe that a 33-foot sculpture catalogued merely as ‘JE 46278’ actually depicts Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene - the twin babies of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII. The revelation comes courtesy of Giuseppina Capriotti, an Egyptologist at the Italy's National Research Council. Ancient: The sculpture, which was found in 1918, depicts Cleopatra's twins. Stone-cold truth: The 33-foot sculpture was catalogued merely as 'JE 46278' She described the statue’s unusual looks to Discovery News: ‘It shows two naked children, one male and one female, of identical size standing within the coils of two snakes. Each figure has an arm over the other’s shoulder,‭ ‬while the other hand grasps a serpent.’ She added: ‘Unfortunately the faces are not well preserved, but we can see that the boy has curly hair and a braid on the right side of the head, typical of Egyptian children. The girl’s hair is arranged in a way‬ similar to the so-called ‭m‬elonenfrisur‭ (‬melon coiffure ) an elaborated hairstyle often associated with the Ptolemaic dynasty, and Cleopatra particularly.’ Born in Alexandra in 69BC into a Macedonian Greek dynasty that had ruled Egypt for three centuries, Cleopatra was the last pharaoah of Ancient Egypt, acceding to the throne at just 17 years of age. Lavish: 1963's Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor in the starring role. It’s said she committed suicide in 30BC by holding an asp to her breast after defeat in the battle of Actium. She has been immortalised in numerous works of art as well as Shakespeare’s Antony And Cleopatra and the lavish 1963 film Cleopatra, where she was played by Elizabeth Taylor. The fabled Queen also had a child – Caesarion – with Julius Caesar – and another son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, with Antony. Highlights:","output":"1.

When given the choice of receiving an injection of THC or a placebo, rats consistently choose the placebo.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Rats will choose THC every time it is offered.  \\"?","output":"This premise directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"Rats will choose THC every time it is offered.\\" According to the given premise, rats have consistently chosen a placebo over an injection of THC when given the choice between the two. This means they have not chosen THC every time it was offered; in fact, they have consistently avoided it. The premise reveals a clear preference of rats for placebo over THC. Given a choice, rats decidedly don't opt for THC, suggesting that, for whatever reason-be it a dislike for the effects, some natural aversion, or some other unknowable rat-logic-THC is not their preferred option. Based on this premise, we can infer that the behavior of rats with respect to the presence of THC is predictable-they are more likely to reject it. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a different scenario, stating that \\"Rats will choose THC every time it is offered.\\" The hypothesis implies that rats would consistently show a preference for THC rather than avoiding it, which directly contradicts the behavior indicated in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, it does not entail the hypothesis. On the contrary, it directly contradicts it. Furthermore, the findings of the premise may lead to various complex discussions and further research opportunities. For example, it encourages the investigation into why rats have displayed an aversion to THC. Understanding the reason behind their constant preference for the placebo can play an essential role in additional animal behavior studies, specifically those involving the effects of different substances. Moreover, it feeds into broader dialogues about the differences and similarities between animal and human responses to substances such as THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. Humans have been known to seek out THC for its psychoactive effects, and understanding why rats seemingly do not could potentially shed light on variances in neurobiology, the influence of social factors on substance use, and other relevant topics. In conclusion, the premise gives us evidence that contradicts the hypothesis \\"Rats will choose THC every time it is offered\\". Instead of endorsing this hypothesis, the premise reveals a much different behavioral pattern: a rat's predictability in avoiding THC when given a choice. This contradiction initiates further inquiry and discussion on the topic, potentially leading to valuable insights in various fields such as animal behavior studies and neurobiology."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to Krakow begins in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a successful businessman, arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture enamelware for the German military. Schindler, an opportunistic member of the Nazi party, lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a functionary in the local Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced (for trade on the black market). Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as \\"Herr Direktor,\\" while Stern handles all administration. Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less (the Jews themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the Reich). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed \\"essential\\" by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or even being killed.Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby, Paszów. The SS soon liquidates the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, is uncooperative, elderly, or infirmed, or for no reason at all. Schindler watches the massacre from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected. He nevertheless is careful to befriend Göth and, through Stern's attention to bribery,...

Article: Australian cities can keep their native wildlife -- but only if they can kick their habit of urban sprawl  . That's the finding of a new study by leading Australian environmental researchers Jessica Sushinsky, Professor Hugh Possingham and Dr Richard Fuller of The University of Queensland. \\"While urban development usually reduces the number of birds in a city, building more compact   cities and avoiding urban sprawl can slow these reductions greatly,\\" says lead author Jessica Sushinsky. \\"Compact housing development leaves birds' homes untouched, leading to fewer losses of birds.\\" The researchers surveyed native and wild birds in Brisbane's urban areas, including living and industrial areas, public parks and gardens, major roadways and airports. They then used statistical modeling to find out what will happen to the birds as the city grows. The first setting was compact growth -- where multiple homes are built on land that previously had only one house. The second setting was sprawling growth -- a familiar pattern where homes are built here and there beyond the city's current boundaries.  The team's forecasts showed that a much greater diversity of species was lost over 20 years in the sprawling setting compared to the more compact setting. \\"Urban sprawl resulted in the disappearance of many urban-sensitive birds -- birds that only live in areas where there is native vegetation  , such as parklands and woodlands,\\" Ms Sushinsky says.  \\"On the other hand, we found the city with the compact development attracted more birds because it kept more of its parks and green areas.\\" Now the Queensland Government has adopted the more compact urban growth strategy, which, Dr Richard Fuller says, is good news for Australia's native birds. These birds are environmental specialists -- they need a particular environment to do well. \\"While compact development means smaller backyards, it can also make our entire cities more biodiverse,\\" according to Dr Fuller. \\"The study shows that we should hold on to our green spaces instead of...

He wanted his sons to learn not to judge  things too quickly. So he told them to go and look at a pear tree. It was far away from his home. The first son went in winter, the second in spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in autumn. When the sons came back, the old man asked them to say what they had seen. The first son complained the tree was ugly. The second son said the tree was covered with buds  and full of hope. The third son said the tree was full of green leaves. They looked so beautiful, and it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen. The youngest son said that the tree was bowed  down with heavy fruits. It was full of life and fulfillment .

Summarize the following: Ryan Leaf was going to be the next big thing. A great football quarterback, finalist for the Heisman, second-overall pick in the NFL draft. Fast forward a few years, and Leaf is considered one of the biggest busts of all time, having failed to achieve at a high level. Natural talent for playing football doesn't mean anything if you don't commit to building it into a skill. When you find your talent, think of it like a seed that you're planting. You're off to a good start, but you've still got to water it, mulch it, and weed around the edges to make sure your seed grows into a big plant. It takes work. As iron sharpens iron, so one talented person sharpens another. If you've got a talent for something, or even if you just hope to develop talent in some field, surround yourself with other talented people and model yourself after their behaviors, practice routines, and attitudes about their talent. Learn everything you can from talented people.  Find a mentor who's willing to show you the ropes and coach you in developing your new skills. Blossoming guitar players need good teachers beyond YouTube. Blossoming singers need other people to play music with. Developing your talent into a skill and your skill into an ability is going to be hard. The more you learn about a subject, a task, or an ability, the more complicated it becomes. Commit to learning everything you can about your field and challenging yourself to become a master. Turn your talent into something special. Make your talent real. Playing chess might not get easier for Magnus Carlsen, just because he’s a phenomenal player. Now he knows just how complicated the game can be. The more you learn about a game, a skill, or a field, the more there will be to learn. It never gets easy. Even if you've got no talent for the guitar, practicing two hours a day guarantees that you'll get a lot better. Someone who practices, whether it be sport, art, or any other field, will always end up more talented than someone who never picks up their instrument, picks up their paintbrush, someone who never practices. Hard work outruns ability every time.","output":"Ryan Leaf was once a promising football quarterback, but despite his natural talent, he ultimately failed due to a lack of commitment to develop his skills.

Industry 4.0 is a high-tech project, which promotes the computerization of manufacturing  . The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, we are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other automatically. The goal is the Smart Factory, which adapts well and uses resources efficiently as well as linking customers and business partners with great intelligence. Technological basis are the Internet systems and advanced factories. Experts believe that Industry 4.0 could be a reality in about 10 to 20 years. So, what effects does this change have on the classic manufacturing? According to an expert, \\"it is highly likely that the world of production will become more and more networked until everything is connected with everything else.\\" Networks and processes have so far been limited to one factory. But in the time of Industry 4.0, the boundaries   of individual factories will most likely no longer exist.

Question: Given the below context:  Though it reached No. 130 on the Billboard chart, Freak Out! was neither a major commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: I guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of \\"artistry\\". If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tell me what in hell is going on ... The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled Freak Out, which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax. The album developed a major cult following in the United States by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972.  At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted in an attempt to keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out! Zappa criticized the Beatles, as he felt they were \\"only in it for the money\\".Freak Out! was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, ranked at number 243 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" in 2003, and featured in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

The band made its national television debut in support of the album, performing \\"The Trees Get Wheeled Away\\" (a track that was not on the album) on the \\"Late Show with David Letterman\\". The album is referenced in the Jonathan Franzen novel \\"Freedom\\" when the main characters Walter and Richard attend a Bright Eyes concert in Washington D.C. during the \\"Lifted\\" tour.  - Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska. Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel. The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the \\"Creekers\\". Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to \\"Spend an evening with Saddle Creek\\" (later to be the title of the label's DVD.) Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship.

Write highlights for this article: There are seemingly millions of smartphone apps out there designed to make traveling easier, but not all of them are very good. Every company seems to think that it needs an app to be cool, but not every app is worth the effort. Here are some of the apps that I find to be most helpful while on the road:. FlightAware. I'm one of those guys who always thinks that more information is better, and that's why I like FlightAware. You can see exactly where your flight (or any other flight) is at the moment. I've used the FlightAware website for years to see near real-time flight tracking, and now there's an app as well. Were you told your airplane is coming from Wichita, but it's still not there and you should be boarding? Go to FlightAware to see where the airplane is right now. FlightAware is hardly the only one in this space. Other frequent fliers swear by FlightTrack Pro, for example. GateGuru. When I was in Atlanta recently, my wife was looking for something before our next flight. Trying to find the right store in an airport the size of Hartsfield-Jackson is a mind-numbing experience. GateGuru, however, gives the rundown on which stores and restaurants are in each terminal and it pulls in reviews as well. If you're in an airport looking for a particular product or service, this will make your task much easier. Hotel Tonight. Have you ever been somewhere and realized you needed a room for the night? Maybe your flight was canceled or perhaps your meetings ran long. This company negotiates deals with hotels for last-minute rooms in many big cities. Within seconds, you can have the room reserved for a low rate. Taxi Magic. If you don't know a city well, the taxi scene can be confusing. Where is the best place to hail a cab? How much should you pay? Taxi Magic makes it a lot easier. If there's a participating cab company in your city, Taxi Magic will have a cab sent right to you. You can pay directly through the app so you don't have to worry about whether credit is accepted or not. The app and booking services are free, and there's a 1.50 documentation fee for using a credit card through the app. If there isn't a participating cab company in the area, Taxi Magic will give you phone numbers for local companies so you can call and arrange for a cab yourself. TripIt. If you've ever used TripIt online to manage your travel, you know it's a great tool for keeping all your travel plans in one place. Of course, there's also an app for that. See and manage all your travel plans in the TripIt app so you never lose your details. Beyond the basics of flights, hotels and cars, you can also put in things like appointments and meals. Your airline app. This isn't one app; it's dependent upon which airline you fly. If you fly a different airline every time, then it's probably not worth downloading every single airline app. But if you're a loyalist, you should absolutely have it. There are some excellent apps out there that allow you to check flight status, see the standby list, book flights and even check in. Apps will store a mobile boarding pass so you can just flash your phone to get on the airplane (not in all airports, but it's getting there). Some airlines have better apps than others. I've heard rave reviews about the new United Airlines app, but get the apps for the airlines you fly frequently. What would you add to the list? Highlights:","output":"1. FlightAware: This app provides near real-time flight tracking and allows users to see exactly where their flight is at any given moment to stay informed about delays and boarding issues. 2. GateGuru: GateGuru offers information on stores and restaurants in airport terminals, including reviews, making it easier for travelers to find specific products or services while waiting for their flights. 3. Hotel Tonight: For last-minute accommodation needs, Hotel Tonight negotiates deals with hotels in major cities and allows users to reserve rooms at low rates within seconds. 4. Taxi Magic: This app simplifies the taxi experience by sending participating cabs directly to the user's location and allowing payment through the app, or by providing local cab company phone numbers in areas without participating companies. 5. TripIt: The TripIt app allows users to manage and consolidate all their travel plans, including flights, hotels, car rentals, appointments, and meals, in one place for easy access and organization. 6. Airline Apps: Downloading dedicated airline apps for the specific airlines a user frequents can provide useful tools such as flight status updates, mobile boarding passes, booking options, and check-in capabilities, streamlining the travel experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yves Gomes is now a university student in Maryland, but he may soon have to leave the country. \\"I still want to continue with my college education and I want to be able to study here and go to medical school,\\" he said.  Gomes is one of thousands of young illegal immigrants who grew up in the United States and are now studying at American colleges and universities. He is doing well in his studies, but he is fighting deportation to India, a country he left with his parents when he was just 14 months old. They were deported more than a year ago.  \\"If I was to go back to India I would just feel like all of that would have gone to waste because here at least I am still able to go to college,\\" he said.  Immigration is a divisive political issue in the United States with some 11 million people in the country illegally. One element of the debate is the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16. Pending legislation know as the DREAMAct would give them a chance to become legal residents if they complete two years of college or join the military.  Milanie Schwartz, a politically conservative student at the University of Texas, explains why some Americans oppose the legislation.  \\"We think it's unfair that students who are illegal immigrants would get a fast track to citizenship, while people who did come here legally wouldn't have those same opportunities,\\" she said.  \\"The question is legalization or not, \\" said Jon Feere, who also opposes the DREAM Act. He is a policy analyst with the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington and is concerned about the act's effect on the economy. \\"There's a lot of unemployment in the United States right now. And there are already many legal immigrants who are already here who are desperate for those jobs,\\" he said.  But supporters of the DREAMAct say well-educated immigrants would help the economy. Raul Hinojosa is an immigration research analyst at UCLA.\\" Not letting them contribute to the economy would not only lose all the financial investment we have already made in these youths, but we would lose literally trillions of dollars of potential value because they want and are ready to contribute to the US economy,\\" he said.  That's exactly what Yves Gomes wants to do -- finish school and become a doctor. He says without the DREAMAct, many students' dreams will be lost. \\"They are studying at Harvard, they are studying at UCLA--the top universities -- and they all have bright futures and because of the system they are going to be told to go home, go back to a country they don't even know, \\" he said.  The DREAMAct has failed to win passage in Congress since it was first introduced 10 years ago. Now time is running out for passage this year, and opposition Republicans have threatened to block it.

Approximately 55% of the lines in the world are this gauge. All high-speed rail lines (except those in Russia, Uzbekistan, and Finland) are standard gauge. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be (except in the United States, where it is still defined in Imperial and US customary units as ). It is also called the UIC gauge or UIC track gauge, the European gauge in the EU and Russia, or uniform gauge in Queensland, Australia.  - The Petaluma River is a river in the California counties of Sonoma and Marin that becomes a tidal slough for the majority of its length. The headwaters are in the area southwest of Cotati. The flow is generally southward through Petaluma's old town, where the waterway becomes navigable, and then flows another through tidal marshes before emptying into the northwest corner of San Pablo Bay.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of and existing lines in excess of are widely considered to be high-speed, with some extending the definition to include lower speeds in areas for which these speeds still represent significant improvements. The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design.  - In rail transport, track gauge is the spacing of the rails on a railway track and is measured between the inner faces of the load-bearing rails.  - A marsh is a wetland that is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species. Marshes can often be found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds. If woody plants are present they tend to be low-growing shrubs. This form of vegetation is what differentiates marshes from other types of wetland such as swamps, which are dominated by trees, and mires, which are wetlands that have accumulated deposits of acidic peat.  - The Northwestern Pacific Railroad is a regional railroad that serves the North Coast of California. Its main line is long and runs between Schellville and Eureka. An additional portion of the line runs from the Ignacio Wye to the edge of San Rafael. Currently, only the stretch between Schellville and Windsor is in operation with freight and SMART commuter trains.  - George Stephenson (9 June 1781  12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer who built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. Renowned as the \\"Father of Railways\\", the Victorians considered him a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement, with self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praising his achievements. His rail gauge of , sometimes called \\"Stephenson gauge\\", is the standard gauge by name and by convention for most of the world's railways.  - San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad ( SF&NP ) provided the first extensive standard gauge rail service to Sonoma County and became the southern end of the regional Northwestern Pacific Railroad . Sonoma County 's first standard - gauge railroad was the 1 - mile ( 1.6 - km ) Petaluma and Haystack Railroad connecting the city of Petaluma with ferry service to San Francisco from Haystack Landing on the Petaluma River in 1864 . Petaluma and Haystack coaches were pulled by horses after the locomotive exploded on 27 August 1866 . SF&NP began construction from Petaluma northward in 1869 , but inability to make satisfactory arrangements with the City of Petaluma caused the railroad to establish a new southern ferry terminus on the Petaluma River at Donahue Landing . Service was extended north to Santa Rosa in 1870 , and Cloverdale in 1872 . The Fulton and Guerneville Railroad was formed in 1874 to build a SF&NP branch from Fulton to Guerneville on the Russian River . The branch was completed in 1877 . In 1879 , the SF&NP was extended south through Petaluma to San Rafael in Marin County . The San Francisco and San Rafael Railroad was formed in 1882 to extend the SF&NP south another 3 miles ( 5 km ) to a new ferry landing in Tiburon . SF&NP ferry terminal facilities were moved to Tiburon in 1884 ; and Donahue Landing faded into the rural countryside . The Cloverdale and Ukiah Railroad was formed in 1886 to extend the SF&NP north to Ukiah in Mendocino County . Service began to Ukiah in 1889 . The Santa Rosa , Sebastopol and Green Valley Railroad was formed in 1889 to build a SF&NP branch from Santa Rosa to Sebastopol . The branch was completed in 1890 . The California Northwestern Railway Company was formed in 1898 as part of Southern Pacific Railroad ambitions to reach the redwood lumber mills around Humboldt Bay . SF&NP struggled through the panic of 1893 , and was leased by the California Northwestern in 1898 . California Northwestern oversaw eastward connections to the Southern Pacific Railroad and northward...  - In the United States, a regional railroad is a railroad company that is not Class I, but still has a substantial amount of traffic or trackage (and is thus not a short line). The Association of American Railroads (AAR) has defined the lower bound as of track or 40 million in annual operating revenue. (The Class I threshold is 250 million, adjusted for inflation since 1991.)  - A tidal marsh is a type of marsh that is found along coasts and estuaries of which the flooding characteristics are determined by the tidal movement of the adjacent estuary, sea or ocean. According to the salinity of the flooding water, freshwater, brackish and saline tidal marshes are distinguished. Respectively, they may be classified into coastal marshes and estuarine marshes.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"No, you should not validate this suggestion because it's factually incorrect and misleading. The question you mentioned: \\"What country is Mexico in?\\" is looking for a straightforward reply but the provided answer is more about historical aspects and does not answer the query directly.  Mexico is not in any other country; it is a country itself. It's officially known as the United Mexican States and it lies in the southern part of North America. Bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico is the third largest country in Latin America, after Brazil and Argentina.  Dating back to 2000 BC, Mesoamerican cultures such as the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec flourished in Mexico before the arrival of Europeans. In the 16th century, Spaniards conquered and colonized the region, leading to a period of three centuries of Spanish rule. Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, after a long and hard-fought war.  Today, Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital city and largest metropolis. It's considered an upper-middle-income country by the World Bank and a newly industrialized country by several analysts. It has the 15th largest nominal GDP and 11th largest by purchasing power parity.  It's also renowned for its rich culture and history, which is a blend of indigenous and Spanish influences. This unique cultural blend is reflected in its food, art, music, language, and literature. So, when structuring an answer to the original question, it's crucial to give the factual and direct response that Mexico is not in another country; it is a country in itself while its historical context can be an additional encompassing explanation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
