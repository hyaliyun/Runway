Following the overtime win against the Ravens, the Redskins traveled to Cleveland Browns Stadium to take on the Cleveland Browns in hopes to gain their first five-game win streak since 2005. The game started slowly for the Redskins, behind rookie quarterback Kirk Cousins, filling in for fellow rookie Robert Griffin III, who sprained his LCL the week prior. After a series of punts, Cousins threw a pass over the middle that was intercepted by T. J. Ward and returned to the Washington 5. Cleveland then used their first-round rookie, Trent Richardson to punch it in and take a 7-0 lead. However, Cousins was able to settle in after this, as he fired a pass to Leonard Hankerson for a 54-yard score to even the game at 7 apiece. In the second, both teams continued to exchange possessions, and eventually scores, in a tit-for-tat manner, as Kai Forbath connected from 44 yards out to give Washington a 10-7 lead. Cleveland, however would respond with another Richardson touchdown, to take a 14-10 lead at halftime. In the third, Cleveland got the ball first, but Brandon Weeden threw an interception to Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson, and Washington quickly converted, as running back Alfred Morris scored from 3 yards out to put Washington back on top 17-14. Following a Cleveland punt, Washington drove down the field again, and Cousins again found Hankerson, this time from two yards away, and Washington took a 24-14 lead. In the fourth, Washington capitalized on a second Weeden interception, this time by London Fletcher, and capped off the drive with an Evan Royster 4-yard touchdown run to take a 31-14 lead. However, Cleveland would not surrender, as Weeden found wide receiver Travis Benjamin for a 69-yard strike, and got back into the game at 31-21. Not to be outdone, Cousins led a clock-chewing, 5 minute drive that culminated with Morris' 2nd Touchdown run of the day, this time from 8 yards out, to effectively put the game away, taking a 38-21 lead. Cleveland tried to answer, but went four and out, and Washington was able to run out the clock. With the win, the Redskins advance to 8-6 which guarantees them to end the season at .500 for the first time since 2008. Additionally, the win was their fifth consecutive win, their longest streak since Weeks 13-17 of the 2005 season. Most importantly, however, the New York Giants' 34-0 loss to the Atlanta Falcons put Washington in first place in the NFC East, meaning, if they win their final two games, they will be division champions for the first time since 1999. how many yards did royster run to for the td?","output":"Evan Royster ran for a 4-yard touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from the following. (a). Brett set up the wickets while he got the bats.; (b). William set up the wickets while he got the bats.;","output":"William set up the wickets while he got the bats. Enthusiastic about their weekend cricket practice, Brett eagerly took charge of the field while William went to gather the necessary equipment. As William rummaged through his cricket bag in search of the bats, he became momentarily lost in thought about his recent batting performance. During the last few practices, he had noticed a considerable improvement in his technique, but he still struggled with consistency. As he zipped up his cricket bag containing the bats, William noticed a small cricket handbook tucked away in the corner near his gloves. It was titled \\"Mastering Your Cricket Game: The Ultimate Guide to Improving Batting, Bowling, and Fielding Skills.\\" He recalled purchasing it last summer, after an especially disappointing performance at a local tournament. Seeing it reignited his determination to master his skills. Having located the perfect bats for both him and Brett, William decided to take a quick glance at the book before joining his friend on the field. As he flipped through the pages, he found a section on improving batting consistency. The tips in the manuscript seemed tailor-made for his situation. The section outlined strategies like breaking down the batting technique into smaller components and focusing on specific areas that could use improvement. Bolstered by renewed conviction, William made his way back to the cricket field, bat in hand. He noticed that Brett had already completed setting up the wickets and was now waiting at the edge of the pitch, eager to get started. \\"I found these new tips in my cricket guide,\\" William said excitedly, showing Brett the handbook. \\"I think it might help us both become more consistent hitters.\\" Brett inspected the book and nodded in approval. \\"Why not give it a try?\\" he responded. \\"You never know – it might just be the game-changer we both need!\\" As the two friends warmed up, they decided to integrate the tips from the handbook one at a time. Each suggestion, from maintaining a stable stance to focusing on the proper grip and follow-through, seemed to have an immediate impact on their batting performance. Even Brett, who was more experienced and was usually a more consistent hitter than William, found himself benefiting from the advice. As the sun began its slow descent, bathing the cricket field in a warm, golden light, the two friends continued practicing their batting skills, one ball at a time. With newfound confidence and determination, they persevered, pushing themselves to make the most of every practice session. As days turned into weeks, the duo's progress became increasingly noticeable, not only to themselves but also to their teammates and coaches. Word spread about the mysterious cricket guidebook, and soon, their teammates were clamoring to borrow William's special resource. In the end, the magical combination of hard work, dedication, and the tips in the \\"Mastering Your Cricket Game\\" guidebook paid off. William and Brett went on to become integral members of their cricket team, leading their squad to victory in a number of local and regional tournaments. While scaling the ladder of success, the two friends cherished their afternoons on the cricket field – where it all began, with the wickets, the bats, and, of course, that unassuming little handbook that had become their trusted companion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Typically, no license or advanced training beyond just firearm familiarization (for rentals) and range rules familiarization is usually required for using a shooting range in the United States; the only common requirement is that the shooter must be at least 18 or 21 years old (or have a legal guardian present), and must sign a waiver prior to shooting. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: can i go to a shooting range without a license? Pick from:  (1). no.  (2). yes.","output":"(2). Yes. Based on the information given in the above text, it's clear that typically a license or advanced training isn't required to use a shooting range in the United States. While age restriction applies, with the shooter needing to be at least 18 or 21 years old (or have a legal guardian present), and will have to sign a waiver prior to shooting, there isn't a mention of a mandatory requirement of a license. It's important to note, of course, that practices may be different depending on the specific shooting range and possibly the state law. Many shooting ranges may have different policies regarding who is allowed to rent and shoot firearms, and as a matter of safety, they may provide basic training or an introduction to firearm safety rules to individuals who are new to shooting. For example, people who rent firearms at the range may need to demonstrate that they already know how to safely use them or may need to take a basic shooting test. But the rules are not about having a license, but rather ensuring safety and compliance with liability regulations. Also, a waiver is usually required which will need to be signed. This basically means that the individual takes responsibility for the risks associated with firing guns. In summary, it's therefore advisable for one who wishes to shoot at a range to get clear information about the specific requirement of the chosen shooting range and beyond this, to understand the basic safety requirements when handling guns at a shooting range. And while a license may not usually be a requirement, understanding how to safely handle a weapon can improve the shooting experience significantly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a distance measuring equipment (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an instrument landing system (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground.

Let's break down each sentence to understand the subtle differences. Sentence 1: \\"It is endemic to Hawaii, where it is only known from the northern Koolau Mountains of Oahu.\\" In this sentence, the subject is primarily, \\"endemic to Hawaii,\\" referring to the subject being native or specific to the larger region of Hawaii. It then specifies that it can only be found in a smaller region, which is the northern Koolau Mountains of Oahu. Essentially, it conveys that the subject is confined to a specific location within the larger region of Hawaii. Sentence 2: \\"It is endemic to Oahu, where it is only known by the northern Koolau Mountains of Hawaii.\\" This sentence primarily makes the subject \\"endemic to Oahu,\\" indicating that it is native to the island of Oahu, which is part of the archipelago of Hawaii. Then, it further specifies that it is found in the northern Koolau Mountains of Hawaii. Although this sentence also talks about the same specific location - the northern Koolau Mountains - as the first sentence, it highlights the island of Oahu more than the broader region of Hawaii. The differences in the two sentences mainly lie in their emphasis. In the first sentence, the emphasis is primarily on the existence of the subject within the region of Hawaii and then narrows it down to a specific location in Oahu. In the second sentence, the emphasis is on Oahu, then the specific location in Hawaii. In conclusion, while both sentences convey that the subject is native to the northern Koolau Mountains of Oahu, Hawaii, the first sentence emphasizes the broader region of Hawaii, and the second sentence emphasizes the island of Oahu.

Dom Martinus Dom, was a Belgian Trappist monk, and served as the first abbot of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle, where he founded the Westmalle Brewery, in which country? Answer:","output":"Dom Martinus Dom was a Belgian Trappist monk who served as the first abbot of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle. Born on February 29, 1792, in Elversele, Belgium, he played a pivotal role in the development of the Trappist beer tradition that Belgium is now renowned for. The Westmalle Brewery, which Dom Martinus Dom founded, is located in the province of Antwerp in the northern part of Belgium. Belgium, a European country known for its medieval towns, Renaissance architecture, and, of course, its rich beer culture, is bordered by the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and France. The country is divided into three main regions: Flanders, Wallonia, and the Brussels-Capital Region. The Trappist Abbey of Westmalle and the Westmalle Brewery are both situated within Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. The Abbey of Westmalle was founded in 1794 and was initially built as a simple priory for monks who fled from France during the French Revolution. However, in 1836, the priory was officially recognized as a Trappist monastery under the leadership of Dom Martinus Dom. To support themselves and the monastery, the monks began brewing beer for their own consumption, which is known as patersbier or \\"father's beer.\\" This marked the beginning of what would eventually become the Westmalle Brewery. By 1836, the monks began producing beer on a larger scale, and the first brew was ready for consumption the following year. The Westmalle Brewery quickly gained notoriety for its quality beer and distinctive brewing methods. It was the first Trappist brewery to use the term \\"dubbel\\" (double) to describe their strong brown ale, and they also invented the \\"tripel\\" style, which is characterized by a golden color and a high alcohol content. Today, the Westmalle Brewery retains its traditional brewing methods and continues to produce high-quality Trappist beers, which are cherished worldwide. Belgium is home to six of the eleven Trappist breweries worldwide, making it a significant contributor to the Trappist beer heritage. The popularity of Trappist beer has certainly placed Belgium on the global radar for beer enthusiasts, and the legacy of Dom Martinus Dom through the Westmalle Brewery undeniably plays a substantial role in that recognition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can lift the edge of the pancake with a spatula to check its progress – the underside of the pancake should be golden brown. 4. When the pancake is ready, use a spatula to carefully flip it over. Be sure to scoop under the entire pancake to prevent it from breaking during the flipping process. Let the pancake cook on the second side for another 2-3 minutes, or until it's fully cooked through and golden brown. 5. Once the pancake is cooked, transfer it to a serving plate. You can place it in a warm oven to keep it at the desired temperature while you cook the rest of the pancakes. 6. Repeat this process with the remaining batter, ensuring that you re-grease the griddle or pan as needed to prevent sticking. Remember to watch for bubbles on the pancake surface to determine the optimal flipping time. 7. Serve the pancakes with your favorite toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, fruit, whipped cream, or any other desired accompaniments. By following these steps, you'll ensure perfectly cooked, delicious pancakes that are golden brown on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

If so i was reading an article in uh National Geographic and i don't know i don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries they don't have oil or anything and they don't have big tourism, can we conclude that \\"They are as well off as any other country. \\"?","output":"From your brief description of the article, it seems to be discussing the economic status of a specific country. However, without knowing the exact country in question, it is challenging to provide a detailed analysis. Nevertheless, I will attempt to provide a general overview of various factors that can impact a nation's wealth, taking into consideration natural resources, tourism, and other components of economic well-being. There are many factors to consider when examining how well off a country is. Wealth is often measured by national income or gross domestic product (GDP), which represents the total value of goods and services produced within a nation's borders over a specified period. However, other indicators such as the Human Development Index (HDI), which measures a country's standard of living, education levels, and life expectancy, can also provide insight into overall well-being. Natural resources, such as oil, can indeed play a significant role in determining a nation's wealth. Countries that possess substantial amounts of valuable resources can leverage them in the global economy, either through domestic production or export. However, having natural resources alone does not guarantee prosperity. For example, the \\"resource curse\\" theory suggests that countries with abundant resources may experience slower economic growth, political instability, and lower investment in social services due to various factors such as price volatility and reliance on a single export. Tourism is another important component of national wealth. Countries that can attract large numbers of tourists may experience increased GDP through tourist expenditures on accommodation, food, transportation, and other goods and services. However, over-reliance on tourism can be risky because it can lead to economic instability if external factors, such as natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, cause a significant drop in visitor numbers. Other factors that contribute to a nation's wealth include: 1. Human capital: High levels of education and skilled labor can stimulate economic growth and drive innovation. 2. Infrastructure: Efficient transportation, communication, and energy networks can lower the cost of doing business, enabling countries to attract investment and create jobs. 3. Economic diversification: Countries with diverse economies that are not overly reliant on a single sector are more resilient to market fluctuations and external shocks. 4. Governance and political stability: Countries with low levels of corruption, transparent legal systems, and politically stable environments are typically more appealing to foreign investors and better positioned to prosper economically. 5. Access to markets: Countries with access to large consumer markets, either domestically or internationally, are better able to benefit from economies of scale and increased trade. 6. Technology and innovation: Countries that invest in research and development and support technological innovation can experience enhanced productivity and competitiveness. In conclusion, while the absence of lucrative natural resources like oil or a booming tourism industry may seem to suggest that a country is not as well-off as others, it's crucial to consider the multifaceted nature of economic well-being. By taking into account a variety of factors, such as human capital, infrastructure, governance, and market access, it becomes evident that wealth and development are impacted by a complex interplay of elements. A country's overall well-being cannot be solely determined by a single factor such as oil or tourism, but should be evaluated holistically, considering its strengths and weaknesses across various indicators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the world's water is salty ocean water or frozen polar ice. By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified  as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes.  Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\"  In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate  their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a 1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further.  Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days.  City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it.

The general behavioral hypothesis here is \\"It is okay to speak up when someone has an unhealthy lifestyle.\\" The update or context provided is: \\"Their lifestyle is the result of a physical disability.\\"  Here's how we understand and solve the task: 1. Understanding the hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that it's acceptable to express concern or advise someone if they're indulging in an unhealthy lifestyle. 2. Understanding the context: The update offers the information that the person's lifestyle is not a matter of choice or lack of discipline—it's a consequence of a physical disability. This could mean that the person may not be able to change their habits or activities due to their disability. 3. Analysing the relationship between the hypothesis and the update: The context paints a picture where the person in question may not have the liberty to lead a healthier lifestyle due to their disability, thus potentially making it less okay or inappropriate to bring up their lifestyle. This could be seen as disrespectful, insensitive, or unempathetic. 4.

From 1228, after of the Livonian Crusade, through the 1560s, Estonia was part of Terra Mariana, established on 2 February 1207 as a principality of the Holy Roman Empire and proclaimed by Pope Innocent III in 1215 as subject to the Holy See. The southern parts of the country were conquered by Livonian Brothers of the Sword who joined the Teutonic Order in 1237 and became its branch known as the Livonian Order. The Duchy of Estonia was created out of the northern parts of the country and was a direct dominion of the King of Denmark from 1219 until 1346, when it was sold to the Teutonic Order and became part of the Ordenstaat. In 1343, the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa rebelled against German rule in the St. George's Night Uprising, which was put down by 1345. The unsuccessful rebellion led to a consolidation of power for the Baltic German minority. For the subsequent centuries they remained the ruling elite in both cities and in the countryside.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: [ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon...  Guess a valid title for it!

Article: Grant Wood's American Gothic caused a stir in 1930 when it was exhibited for the first time at the Art Institute of Chicago and awarded a prize of 300 dollars. Newspapers across the country carried the story, and the painting of a farmer and a younger woman posed before a white house brought the artist instant fame. In 1930, Grant Wood, an American painter with European training, noticed a small white house built in the small southern Iowa town of Eldon. Wood was so fascinated by it that he decided to paint the house along with the kind of people he thought should live in that house. In the painting, the farmer is modeled on his dentist. Dr. Byron McKeeby. His younger sister Nan served as a model for the woman (imagined to be the farmer's wife or daughter). Wood wanted to give a description of the traditional roles of men and women as the man is holding a pitchfork symbolizing hard labor. Each element was painted separately; the models sat separately and never stood in front of the house. The Gothic style of the house inspired the painting's title. American Gothic remains one of the most famous paintings in the history of American art. The painting has become part of American popular culture. Some believe that Wood used it to satirize  the narrow-mindedness that has been said to characterize Midwestern culture. The painting may also be read as a praise of the moral virtue or rural America or even as a mixture of praise and satire.

Movie title: Idle Hands Context: Lazy stoner teenager Anton Tobias' parents wind up dead on Halloween, with all the clues pointing to him. After killing his best friends Pnub and Mick, Anton realizes that his right hand has become possessed. Unable to control his hand, Anton throws his cat across the street and while searching for it, he encounters his neighbor Molly and the two start a relationship. Anton holds a funeral for his parents and friends. However, Pnub and Mick decide not to go to heaven, returning to their former bodies and rising from the grave. Meanwhile, a druidic high priestess named Debi LeCure is hunting the spirit responsible for killings across the country. After his hand kills two cops in his living room, Anton cuts it off with a cleaver. Pnub and Mick seek out a First-Aid Kit while Anton traps the hand in a microwave, burning it. Meanwhile, Debi (now along with Randy, Anton's neighbor) hunts Anton down to put a stop to the possessed hand. After sending Molly to the school dance, Anton returns home to finish off the hand. Unfortunately Pnub and Mick inadvertently release the hand. The three then steal Randy's truck and head to the school. Mick and Pnub go to the Halloween dance to watch over Molly, while Anton looks for the hand. Randy and Debi meet up with Anton. Debi explains that the hand will drag Molly's soul into the netherworld. Anton crashes the dance and tries to warn everyone about his hand, but is ignored. The hand then scalps the band's lead singer and causes a panic. Molly and her friend Tanya (Katie Wright) escape through the vents. They attempt to go through a fan, which they have stopped with Tanya's shoe, but Tanya gets hung on the rope, Molly tries to pulls Tanya off the fan and Anton's hand ends up removing Tanya's shoe, allowing her to be pulled to her death in the fan. Molly then runs into the art room, causing her to get knocked out. Anton enters and fights with the hand while it is inside a puppet but it escapes to the auto shop, where Molly is strapped to a car in her bra and panties, being...

Given the question: Information:  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - In earth science, erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that remove soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, then transport it away to another location. The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as \\"physical\\" or \\"mechanical\\" erosion; this contrasts with \\"chemical\\" erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres.  - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it.  - The Vettones (Greek: \\"Ouettones\\") were a pre-Roman people of the Iberian Peninsula of possibly Celtic ethnicity.  - A cirque (French, from the Latin word \\"circus\\") is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic \\"coire\\" meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (Welsh for \\"valley\\", pronounced \\"coom\\"). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion.  - An amphitheatre or amphitheater is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek  (\\"amphitheatron\\"), from  (\\"amphi\\"), meaning \\"on both sides\\" or \\"around\\" and  (\\"thétron\\"), meaning \\"place for viewing\\".  - Fluvial is a term used in geography and geology to refer to the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term glaciofluvial or fluvioglacial is used.  - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian.  - Castile and León (Leonese: \\"Castiella y Llión\\" ) is an autonomous community in north-western Spain. It was constituted in 1983, although it existed for the first time during the First Spanish Republic in the 19th century. León first appeared as a Kingdom in 910, whilst the Kingdom of Castile gained an independent identity in 1065 and was intermittently held in personal union with León before merging with it permanently in 1230. It is the largest autonomous community in Spain and the third largest region of the European Union, covering an area of with an official population of around 2.5 million (2011).  - The Central System, Spanish and , is one of the main systems of mountain ranges in the Iberian Peninsula. 2,592 m high Pico Almanzor is its highest summit.   - The Sierra de Gredos is a mountain range in central Spain that spans the provinces of Ávila, Salamanca, Cáceres, Madrid, and Toledo. It is part of the much larger Central System of mountain ranges. Its highest point is Pico Almanzor, at 2,592 metres and it has been declared a natural park by the Autonomous Community of Castile and León. The Sierra de Gredos is one of the most extensive mountain ranges of the Central System; it comprises five river valleys: the Alto Tormes, the Alto Alberche, the Tiétar Oriental, the Tiétar Occidental y la Vera, and the Valle del Ambroz. The first known inhabitants were the Vettones, a pre-Roman Celtic people. The central part of the range encomprises the Sierra de Gredos Regional Park.  - The Circo de Gredos is a glacial cirque situated in the central part of the northern slope of the Sierra de Gredos ( the main range in the Sistema Central mountains in central Spain ) . It is one of the most important areas in the Parque Regional de la Sierra de Gredos . It is the most significant glacial cirque of the Sierra de Gredos , and of the entire Sistema Central , approximately 33 hectares ( 330,000 square meters ) in area . At the East edge of the cirque is the summit Pico Almanzor , the highest of the range at 2,592 meters . At the North - East edge , the bottom of the cirque , there is the Laguna Grande de Gredos at a height of 1,940 metres . Next to this lake is the mountain refuge Elola , much frequented by mountaineers who intend to climb Pico Almanzor . The cirque is within the basin of the river Tormes , a tributary of the river Duero . It is part of the Sierra de Gredos Regional Park . There is a route that leads to the cirque which is very busy with tourists and mountaineers , particularly in the summer . This path starts from parking that is known as the Plataforma de Gredos at 1,770 meters . The well defined route climbs South - West from here , and then across a grassy boggy moor to arrive at the Barrerones ( 2,210 metres ) . From here , the path descends south until reaching the Laguna Grande ( or great lake ) de Gredos , and the refuge Elola .  - A cauldron (or caldron) is a large metal pot (kettle) for cooking and/or boiling over an open fire, with a large mouth and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger.  - Pico Almanzor is the highest mountain in central Spain. Situated in the Sierra de Gredos in the province of Ávila, Almanzor is high. It is made of granite. The mountain is also known as \\"Pico de Almanzor\\" and \\"Moro Almanzor\\".

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Question: What is authors role as an engineer?

If what'd they do for that did they have to cast it and, can we conclude that \\"So how did they accomplish it, did they use a mold?\\"?","output":"The original question seems to be about a certain object or structure and the process by which it was created. Based on the information provided, it appears that casting may have been involved, which often requires the use of a mold. Let's dive deeper into the casting process and how molds are typically used. Casting is a manufacturing process that involves pouring liquid material, like molten metal or even certain plastics, into a mold or a cavity, allowing it to cool and solidify, and then extracting the final piece. This process is widely used to create a variety of items, from small parts and components to large structures and sculptures. The material used can either be a metal like aluminum, iron, or bronze, or a plastic polymer. To answer the question \\"So how did they accomplish it, did they use a mold?\\": Yes, it is highly likely that they used a mold to achieve the final product. Here's a more detailed explanation of how the casting process with mold usually works: 1. Design and create a pattern: The first step involves designing a pattern of the desired object. This pattern will be used to create a mold. Patterns can be created from wood, metal, plastic, or foam, and are designed taking into consideration any likely shrinkage or distortion that may occur during the casting process. 2. Prepare the mold: A mold is made based on the pattern, in two or more sections, depending on the complexity of the object. Often, a reusable mold such as a metal or silicone mold is used, letting multiple identical objects be created. Molds can also be made from sand or plaster for single-use runs, which will break to remove the cast object. 3. Apply a release agent: A release agent is applied to the mold to prevent the cast material from sticking to the mold surface. 4. Pour the casting material: The chosen liquid material, be it metal or polymer, is heated to the appropriate temperature and then carefully poured into the mold's cavity, filling it completely. 5. Cooling and solidification: After filling the mold, the material is allowed to cool and solidify. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of the object and the material properties. 6. Remove the casting: Once the material has hardened, the mold sections are separated, and the final object is carefully removed. The extraction process might require breaking the mold in case of sand or plaster molds. 7. Finishing touches: After the object is removed from the mold, any excess material or imperfections, such as casting lines or blemishes, can be trimmed or polished away. This step will depend on the end use of the casting and the desired finish. In conclusion, considering the information provided about the casting process, it is quite logical to assume that a mold was used in order to create the object or structure in question. The process I described offers insights into the intricate nature of casting and the important role of molds in achieving a desired shape and design."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This music player is easy to navigate and has an aesthetically pleasing interface, making it a treat to use as I explore my vast music library. The sorting options for playlists, folders, and genres provide great organization capabilities and enhance my overall experience while browsing through my favorite tunes. The app can handle a variety of file formats and consistently delivers high-quality audio, making it an essential addition to my device. The integrated equalizer is a bonus, allowing me to customize the sound of my music to my personal preferences, further enhancing my listening experience. Additionally, the app sports a visually appealing album art feature that effortlessly syncs with my music library, giving it a polished and professional look.  However, as a 4-star rating suggests, there is still room for growth and improvement. The occasional lag when switching between tracks and navigating through the app can sometimes detract from the otherwise smooth experience. The search functionality also appears to be a bit limited, requiring precise input for locating specific songs, artists, or albums. Finally, though the in-app ads are relatively non-invasive, they can be a minor inconvenience at times, particularly when they interrupt the user experience. In conclusion, the naman14.timber app is a solid 4-star music player that offers a smooth and enjoyable experience for users to discover and enjoy their music. Although there are areas for improvement, such as performance lags and enhanced search capabilities, the overall package is worth giving a try. With continuous development and updates, this app can become a top choice for music lovers everywhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Avery, who wears a Confederate Army uniform even though he didn't serve in the Civil War, demands that the men who work for rancher John Rutherford avenge him after Rutherford is killed trying to remove a squatter, Corey Everett, from his land. A passing family, the Ferbers, are traveling by wagon. They meet Corey, who explains that he is homesteading, not squatting, and entitled to the property. Corey defended himself alone with dynamite after Rutherford's men attacked, but Avery became convinced that Corey had many men fighting by his side.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. London 2012: It’s enthralling being immersed with the most beautiful of athletes That need has been answered by modern camera technology, now not only waterproof, but boredom-proof. The underwater cameras mean that you’re no longer a mere spectator, watching from a distance, from outside. You’re there, in the water, with the swimmers in their element, as they stream powerfully forward. The difference between watching from the stands, and the views offered on television – it’s like the difference between looking at a David Hockney picture, and finding yourself suddenly a participant in it. It is magical to glide each length’s 50 metres in the company of these athletes: I’d have loved to have won a ticket to the Aquatics Centre (and I don’t have a competitive bone in my body), but the view from home must be better than that from the venue (certainly than from the empty corporate stands, where practically nobody appears to see anything). Everyone who loves swimming, no matter the state of their stroke, understands that yearning for forward propulsion, understands too the transformative power of the water. I’m nothing like a good swimmer, but sometimes, just sometimes, a beat or two of a stroke will come... just so. And that’s the best moment of the week. Just for that instant, I’m back inside the picture. It is curious, too, that the swimmer – at their athletic best, the most beautiful of human creatures – remains (in their element, again) one of the most anonymous, most mysterious of athletes. Water washes away the tiny differences between human beings, the ones we fixate about on dry land, the ones that can break a man’s heart or create great art. If you don’t believe me, listen to the commentators: “That’s her! In the red cap! I think. No, she’s in the next lane!” Submersion brings anonymity, and even for those of us who are nothing like athletes, anonymity brings release from the day’s cares, and that, in turn, brings the freedom to be most yourself. I am short and waddly on dry land. I constantly fret about my appearance and the impression my poor choice of clothes and general slovenliness engenders, despite never being able to cure any of my bad habits. But all those worries melt away in the water. Stephen, the man who tries to improve my swimming, asks at the start of lessons how the week’s going. I’m always like: “Oh, you know, busy, and, you know. Stuff”, and I’m usually frowning when I say it. And he says: “Don’t worry. There’s always the water.” I think Stephen would agree with Iris, and would go further: there is a lot of water on the planet, and for many of us, its embrace is a necessary balm for living. I’d guess that Rebecca Adlington, whose graceful power in the water catches the spectator’s breath, would agree too. For Rebecca, and all those other wonderful swimmers who have given such pleasure at the Games, there’s always the water, refractive medium for their heart-stopping, aquatic beauty. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about how amazing it is to watch the athletes swim during the London 2012 Olympics. The writer mentions how underwater cameras make it even more exciting to watch the swimmers, making it feel like you're in the water with them.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who moved to Sedbergh School in 1827, where he remained for two years? , can you please find it?   Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

Context: To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What is probably true about the author?

Staying connected: Facebook lets you be friends with people from all over the world, so you can talk to them and see their photos, videos, and updates. 2. Sharing: You can share your own pictures, videos, and thoughts with your friends and family, and they can do the same. 3. Group activities: Facebook has groups where people with similar interests can gather and talk about their favorite topics, like puppies or superheroes. 4. Events: You can invite your friends to parties or get-togethers, and see which of your friends are going to fun places too. Cons (Not-so-good things): 1. Privacy: Sometimes people share things they probably shouldn't, like private information or unkind words about others, and that can be seen by many people. 2. Screen time: Spending too much time on Facebook can keep you away from doing other important things, like homework or playing outside. 3. Fake news and misinformation: Sometimes, people may share things that aren’t true, and that can cause confusion or worry. 4.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which area experiences less soil erosion?  The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon.  Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Answer:","output":"The Valley experiences less soil erosion. The paragraph states that the Valley has more fertile soil, is not overgrazed, has abundant trees and bushes, and has increased productivity over the past decade.

Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in.

The move is a victory for the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign. Article:","output":"Title: Victory for Daily Mail's Block Online Porn Campaign as Government Considers Opt-In System The government is pushing for greater control over the spread of explicit content online by contemplating the idea of implementing an 'opt-in' system for access to pornographic material hosted by internet service providers (ISPs). This move is a significant triumph for the Daily Mail's Block Online Porn Campaign, which has consistently called for necessary measures to protect younger generations from accidentally coming across explicit content on the internet. The proposed 'opt-in' system would require adult users to request access to adult content, instead of being freely available, as is the case now. This shift in governing and regulating pornography would effectively prevent minors from easily accessing age-inappropriate material online, a pressing issue that has long been a cause for concern among parents, educators, and the general public. With the current unrestricted access to pornography on the internet, it is no surprise that many users, including children, come across explicit content unintentionally. Implementing the 'opt-in' system would require ISPs to set up a filtering and blocking mechanism by default, forcing individuals to make a conscious choice and actively provide their age and consent before gaining access to adult content. The success of the Daily Mail's Block Online Porn campaign has been instrumental in bringing this issue into the limelight and generating significant public support. The campaign has raised awareness of the negative effects of easy access to explicit material and the potential harm it may cause to younger individuals, both mentally and emotionally. With mounting instances of cyberbullying, sexually explicit content shared without consent, and the rise of revenge porn, addressing online pornography has become a matter of paramount importance. From a technical standpoint, the implementation of an opt-in system would put an onus on ISPs to introduce pioneering mechanisms that can effectively filter and block online pornography. However, it would be crucial for the government and the ISPs to work closely together to ensure that the filters being applied are both ethically sound and do not infringe on the privacy rights of users. Moreover, it would be necessary to educate the public on the opt-in mechanism, address potential shortcomings, and provide a clear and straightforward framework for opting-in. In conclusion, the government's canvassing of views on the 'opt-in' system reflects a significant shift in the approach towards regulating access to explicit content online. The eventual implementation of this system could go a long way in protecting younger generations from stumbling upon explicit material and promoting a safer online environment for all users. The Daily Mail's Block Online Porn campaign has successfully pushed for a change in the policies surrounding online pornography, and it will continue to call for improved safety measures and solutions for a more secure and responsible internet landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea. it's not.

Context: Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.  But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

Review: is n't just a poor fit with kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The given movie review sentence appears to be negative. The phrase \\"poor fit\\" signifies that the element being referred to, in this case, \\"Kieslowski's lyrical pessimism,\\" does not align well with the movie being reviewed. In general, this implies that the reviewer perceives some disharmony or inconsistency between the film's content, tone, or thematic elements and the notable director Kieslowski's particular style of storytelling. Krzysztof Kieslowski was a Polish film director widely known for his character-driven, poetic, and visually stunning films that often deal with themes like existentialism, morality, and human nature. His works, such as \\"The Decalogue\\" and \\"The Three Colors Trilogy,\\" are marked by a specific melancholic and contemplative tone, which the review refers to as \\"lyrical pessimism.\\" The reviewer's use of \\"poor fit\\" suggests that the film's attributes or attempts to evoke Kieslowski's \\"lyrical pessimism\\" fall short or feel out of place in the context of the movie. This negative comment may indicate that the filmmaker's attempt to channel or pay homage to Kieslowski's signature style did not meet the reviewer's expectations or that the movie itself did not succeed in harmonizing the more poignant or somber elements with Kieslowski's preferred thematic or tonal landscape. In conclusion, the movie review sentence leans heavily towards the negative side, emphasizing an unsuccessful blending or meshing of the film's qualities with the quintessential characteristics of Kieslowski's body of work, which is known for its introspective, emotional, and thought-provoking nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This review is based on our experience with a comedy show in the Plaza showroom.   We purchased tickets online and were instructed to pick them up at Will Call. A word to the wise: Will Call is located at the concierge desk, which is next to the front desk, a brisk walk away from the showroom. This may have been the case for this show only, but our tickets were not actually at Will Call; they were being held, along with everyone else's at the door to the showroom. It took a lot of walking and being misdirected, but we eventually got into the venue.  Another word to the wise: this place is teeny tiny. Maybe 250-300 people max. The seating is arranged almost exactly like the South Point showroom: the front area has long tables radiating out from the stage, while the back section has round booths. It seems like this is the go-to arrangement for a venue with a semi-circle stage, but all it gives the audience is a bad viewing angle and a sore neck.   There is nothing special about the venue itself. Typical Vegas, with a gold ceiling, giant chandeliers and red velvet booths.   On this occasion, it seems like the show was vastly oversold, leading the ushers to pull chairs from wherever they could and seat people in the aisles. Kind of a bummer.   A tip: there is drink service within the venue, but it's by waitress, so it can be slow and the waitress (just the one, mind you) covered maybe half the venue. While it is \\"technically\\" against the rules, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on bringing drinks from the casino bar into the showroom.   While I don't know how much of our experience was due to an outside company running the show itself, the experience was meh. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment? Choose your answer from: a). negative; b). positive;","output":"a). negative; The review can be described as having a negative sentiment because the user expresses several complaints and disappointments with their experience, such as being misdirected, having a poor seating arrangement, and dealing with slow drink service. They also mention that the venue was oversold, leading to additional seating issues. The overall description of the experience is \\"meh,\\" which further highlights the negative sentiment. The positive aspects mentioned, such as the typical Vegas decor, are not strong enough to balance out the negative elements, making the overall sentiment negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"Appleton International Airport is a significant transportation hub located in Greenville, Wisconsin. This airport plays a crucial role in connecting the region with various other domestic and international destinations, allowing for passenger travel and cargo transportation. The airport is situated at an elevation of 280 feet (approximately 85 meters) above sea level. This value is important as it helps to determine the airport's air pressure, temperature, and weather conditions, which can significantly impact flight operations. Additionally, elevation data can be crucial in the planning and execution of takeoffs and landings. The higher the elevation, the thinner the air, which can impact the performance of an aircraft and require adjustments in operational procedures. One of the notable features of Appleton International Airport is its runway. The airport has a runway named \\"12/30,\\" which indicates its orientation with respect to the compass. The numbers 12 and 30 in the runway name represent their magnetic headings, i.e., the direction the runway faces. A runway designated as \\"12\\" faces 120 degrees, while runway \\"30\\" faces 300 degrees. The dual numerical representation is due to the bi-directional nature of the runway, allowing for aircraft to utilize it in both directions. The runway's length at Appleton International Airport is 1,982 feet (approximately 604 meters). This measurement is an essential aspect of the airport's infrastructure, as it determines the size and types of aircraft that can safely use the runway for takeoff and landing. Longer runways can accommodate larger, heavier aircraft, while shorter runways may be restricted to smaller planes. Runway length is especially important for commercial airports, where various aircraft types visit regularly, and safe operations are paramount. In summary, Appleton International Airport, located in Greenville, Wisconsin, boasts a runway named \\"12/30\\" that is 1,982 feet long. Sitting 280 feet above sea level, its elevation plays a significant role in determining various operational factors at the airport. The airport's facilities cater to the needs of both commercial and cargo transportation, providing essential connections for the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A young Jesuit is chosen to lead the expedition, Father Laforgue(Lothaire Bluteau). Daniel(Aden Young), a young Frenchman working in the outpost is also chosen after he expresses an interest in returning to France and entering the priesthood. Champlain uses pots, knives, hammers and beads to barter for the services of Chomina(August Schellenberg), an Algonquin, to take the men to the Huron mission.

The paragraph specifically refers to the PC plan for growth and its aim is to enhance the economic growth and overall well-being of Canadians. The plan mentions a holistic policy that encompasses multiple aspects of the Canadian economy targeting tax relief, job opportunities, and financial flexibility for Canadians. The paragraph emphasizes the importance of enabling Canadians to have more flexibility with their RESP contributions and transfers from their RRSPs. RESPs (Registered Education Savings Plans) and RRSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans) are government-assisted programs unique to Canada designed to encourage long-term savings for education costs and retirement respectively. Furthermore, the proposed growth plan highlights different aspects of economic growth policies that would benefit the Canadian people: 1. Tax relief: By providing tax relief, the government aims to lessen the tax burden on Canadians, allowing them to have more disposable income which can be invested back into the economy. 2. Lower income taxes: Reducing income tax rates can also help increase the disposable income for Canadians while encouraging spending and investment activities that stimulate economic growth. 3. Lower payroll taxes: By lowering payroll taxes, businesses may be able to hire more employees, which could lead to a reduction in unemployment rates and contribute positively to the nation's economy. 4. Greater job opportunities: The plan aims to create better job opportunities and increase overall employment in Canada. A growing job market would encourage young Canadians to stay and contribute domestically. The paragraph also underlines the fact that these policies would keep young people \\"here where they belong,\\" which implies that the growth plan is focused on retaining young talent to boost Canada's economy in the long term. In conclusion, considering the various elements and the intent mentioned in the paragraph to improve the Canadian economy and citizens' well-being by focusing on aspects such as taxation, employment opportunities, financial flexibility, and retaining young talent, one could certainly conclude that \\"The growth plan is for Canada.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Lakes and Ponds Lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. In the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. Light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. Phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. Zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms that sink to the bottom. Nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. Because of this, they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom. Algal blooms (Figure 44.24) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water. As a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. When the algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. Fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe. Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges.   Q: At the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in what zone break down dead organisms that sink there?   A: Options: (i). photic; (ii). photoreactive zone; (iii). trophic; (iv). aphotic zone; Answer:","output":"(iv). aphotic zone;"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: On a grassy plain in South Africa,thousands of miles from home,two pairs of Zoo--bred South China tiger cubs----one-year-o1d Hope and Cathay and six-month-old Tiger Woods and Madonna--are learning to hunt in the wild.The hope is that they will one day pass on their skills to their young,allowing the next generation to get back to wildlife reserves in China. A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters. All four animals will finally return to Zoos in China while the pioneering pairs' cubs will grow up completely wild.The aim is for _ to go to reserves developed in China by 2008,when the Olympic Games will be held in Beijing. Question: Which of the following is true? Options: A: There are about 100 South China tigers at the Zoos in China. B: South China tigers at the Zoos in China usually eat chicken.

What is the solution? Solve 0 = 148*n - 130*n + 162 for n.","output":"To find the solution for the given equation, we need to solve the equation 0 = 148n - 130n + 162 for the variable n. Step 1: Firstly, combine the like terms with the variable n on one side of the equation. 0 = 148n - 130n + 162 Step 2: Subtract 130n from 148n to get the following equation: 0 = 18n + 162 Step 3: Now, we need to isolate the variable n. To do this, we first subtract 162 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 162 = 18n + 162 - 162, so, -162 = 18n Step 4: Finally, to find the value of n, divide both sides by 18: -162 ÷ 18 = 18n ÷ 18, so, -9 = n So, the solution to the equation 0 = 148n - 130n + 162 is n = -9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Devereux Answer:","output":"Title: Atonement of Devereux Genre: Drama, Mystery Setting: A small countryside town in England, 1950s Main Characters: 1. Devereux Smith - A kind-hearted yet misunderstood man in his mid-30s who has a knack for stirring up trouble. 2. Father Thomas - The compassionate and dedicated priest of the small town. 3. Rose Brown - A pianist and music teacher, both headstrong and empathetic, who takes an interest in Devereux's plight. 4. Jacob Ellis - A cunning and self-serving member of the church who despises Devereux. 5. Emily Harding - Devereux's old friend who turns her back on him after the incident. Plot: Part 1 - Introducing Devereux Devereux Smith, a stout man with unruly hair and a disheveled appearance, arrives in the small countryside town of Meadowbridge, hoping to escape his past and start anew. He joins a local church, led by the compassionate and dedicated Father Thomas. Devereux becomes a regular member of the church, attending weekly services and finding solace in the tight-knit community. Despite his hard work and dedication, he remains unknown to most and forms only a couple of friendships, including one with Emily Harding, a fellow parishioner. Part 2 - The Incident One day, while cleaning the church with other volunteers, Devereux accidentally damages an antique religious relic, a wooden cross. Initially, it seems like an innocent accident, but Jacob Ellis, a cunning and self-serving member of the church who secretly despises Devereux, convinces the congregation that the act was an intentional act of blasphemy. Following a heated confrontation led by Jacob and other parishioners, Devereux is expelled from the church and ostracized by the community which he thought had become his home. Part 3 - Rose's Intervention Rejected and shunned by the townspeople, Devereux seeks refuge in a small cabin situated at the edge of town. Meanwhile, Rose Brown, a talented pianist and music teacher in Meadowbridge, takes an interest in Devereux's plight after witnessing his banishment. Driven by a strong sense of justice, she begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident despite the townspeople's reluctance to discuss it. In the process, Rose uncovers Jacob's deceit and learns about Devereux's troubled past, including a history of mental health issues and neglect. As Devereux and Rose become closer, she begins to believe in his innocence. Part 4 - The Fight for Redemption With Rose by his side, Devereux attempts to clear his name and make amends. Initially, Father Thomas doubts their claim, but he eventually agrees to hear Devereux's side of the story. Together, they confront Jacob, who continues to manipulate the parishioners and maintains his lies. Tensions escalate, and Devereux fights to prove himself even as he struggles with his own demons that stem from his past. Part 5 - Atonement and the Future Ultimately, Rose, Devereux, and Father Thomas expose Jacob's deception, earning the support of the town, and restoring Devereux's reputation. Devereux is welcomed back into the church and his bond with Emily Harding is mended. Inspired by the power of compassion and forgiveness, Devereux takes on the role of a counselor, using his experiences to help others facing similar struggles. Rose and Devereux form a strong romantic relationship, and he becomes an integral part of Meadowbridge's tight-knit community. The movie ends on a hopeful note as Devereux, surrounded by his newfound friends and loved ones, continues on a renewed path of redemption and self-discovery, proving that everyone deserves a chance to heal and be accepted."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: The input is a conversation between an automated system and a user, followed by a question.

Paragraph- Sent 1: The violent arena of domestic abuse litigation has grown a bit more volatile here, now that a judge has decided to hold two women in contempt of court for returning to men who had been ordered to stay away from them. Sent 2: \\"You can't have it both ways,\\" said Judge Megan Lake Thornton of Fayette County District Court in recently fining two women 100 and 200 respectively for obtaining protective orders forbidding their partners from contacting them, then relenting and contacting the men. Sent 3: Ruling that the order was mutually binding, Judge Thornton also cited the men for contempt. Sent 4: \\"It drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want,\\" said Judge Thornton, who is experienced in the state's thick domestic abuse docket, which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective orders a year. Sent 5: Kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive relationships in the state. Sent 6: Judge Thornton's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered women, who plan to appeal it. Sent 7: The advocates say the finding goes beyond existing law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic abuse cases, which involve economic and family dependency and other complications of daily living. Sent 8: The state office on domestic violence has pointedly agreed, warning that the ruling could cause abused women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Last year college students in America spent an estimated 700 on textbooks on average. The National Association of College Stores reported more than five billion dollars in sales of textbooks and course materials. The association spokesman Charles Schmidt says electronic textbooks now just make up 2%~3% of sales. But he says that is expected to reach 10%~15% by 2012. Online versions  are now available for many of the most popular college textbooks. An etextbook can cost half the price of a new print textbook. But students usually lose access to them after the end of the term. And the books cannot be placed on more than one device ,so they are not easy to share. So what do students think of etextbooks?Administrators at Northwest Missouri State University wanted to find it out. Earlier this year they tested them with 500 students in 20 classes. The university is unusual. It provides laptop computers for all 7,000 of its fulltime students. It does not require students to buy their textbooks either. They rent them to save money. The school aims to save even more by moving to etextbooks. The students in the survey reported that downloading the books from the Internet was easy. They liked the idea of carrying lighter backpacks. And 56% said they were better able to find information. But most found that using etextbooks did not change their study habits. And 60% felt they read more when they were reading on paper. In all,almost half the students said they still liked physical textbooks better. But the survey found that cost could be a big influence.55% said they would choose etextbooks if using them meant their textbook rental fee would not increase. Roger Von Holzen heads the Center for Information Technology in Education at Northwest Missouri State University. He tells us that administrators are disappointed with the etextbooks now available because the majority are not interactive . He thinks growth will come when more digital books include video,activities,games and other ways to interact with the information....

My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Sentence 1 highlights that a part of the torrent (likely referring to an influx of funds or investments) has contributed to a significant price increase of as much as 50 percent for prime residential blocks in the first half of this year. This suggests that the price surge took place during the initial six months of the year. 2. Sentence 2 states that the price increase occurred in the second part of the year. This implies that the surge in prices happened during the latter half of the year, most likely in the third and fourth quarters. Based solely on the information given, it is unclear if the price increases mentioned in the sentences represent the same surge in property prices or if they are separate instances of growth. It is possible that the 50% price increase mentioned in Sentence 1 occurred in the first half of the year, while another, potentially different, price increase happened in the second half of the year, as mentioned in Sentence 2. However, if we assume that both sentences are referring to the same price increase in the property market, then they are seemingly contradictory, as the first sentence establishes that the surge occurred in the first half of the year, while the second sentence claims that the increase happened in the latter half. In this case, if we assume Sentence 1 is true, we would conclude that Sentence 2 is not true, given that the information conflicts with the timeline established in Sentence 1. To conclusively determine the veracity of Sentence 2, either additional context or clarification on the price increase's timeline is required. Only then can we accurately and confidently assess if the second sentence is true or false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this \\"Two Americans were killed and a third was wounded in a raid in Afghanistan against Islamic State group militants, the Pentagon has confirmed.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Pentagon Confirms Two Americans Killed and One Wounded in Afghanistan Raid Against ISIS Militants  Introduction  The United States Department of Defense has confirmed that two American military personnel were killed and a third was injured during a joint raid against ISIS militants in Afghanistan. The targeted operation, which unfolded in the tumultuous region of Afghan territory, demonstrates the ongoing commitment by the United States and its partners to eliminate the threats posed by extremist organizations in the region. The loss of two American lives in this raid serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers faced by those who strive to restore peace and stability to the country.  Background Afghanistan has been a hotspot for conflict and terrorism over the past few decades, with various extremist groups, such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, causing widespread violence, fear, and instability in the region. The emergence of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, has further exacerbated these issues with the organization's brutal tactics and relentless pursuit of power. In response, the United States and its NATO allies have been actively engaged in military operations, assisting the Afghan government forces in their efforts to combat these terrorist organizations and restore order in the country.  Details of the Raid The recent raid which led to the tragic loss of two Americans was a joint operation conducted by United States military forces and Afghan security personnel. This combined effort, targeting the Islamic State group's local militants, reflects a broader strategy to dismantle and ultimately destroy the organization's operations in the region. The operation took place in a remote area in Afghanistan, where intelligence reports had indicated a strong presence of ISIS militants.  Despite the loss of two American lives and an injured soldier, the raid is reported to have been successful in neutralizing several key ISIS members and disrupting the group's operations in the area. Military officials have emphasized the importance of joint operations in ensuring maximum effectiveness and minimizing the risk to civilian populations.  The Aftermath  The families of the fallen soldiers have been informed about their tragic loss, and the military has ensured that they receive the necessary support and assistance to cope with the devastating news. The injured soldier is receiving the best medical care to support a speedy recovery.  As investigations into the raid continue, additional details about the encounter may emerge. The United States, together with its coalition partners, remains committed to working alongside the Afghan security forces to eradicate terrorism and support the government in achieving long-lasting peace and stability in the country.  Conclusion  The tragic deaths of two Americans in the recent raid against ISIS militants in Afghanistan underscore the high stakes and dangerous nature of the fight against terrorism. It serves as a reminder that the United States and its partners still face significant challenges in their ongoing efforts to neutralize and eliminate threats posed by extremist organizations in the region. While the loss of these soldiers is a painful blow to the US military and the families of the deceased, their efforts and sacrifices in the service of global peace and security will not be forgotten. The continued commitment to eradicating terrorist organizations and stabilizing Afghanistan is a testament to their valiant contributions in the pursuit of a safer, more equitable world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An Australian man who \\"surfed\\" a floating whale carcass surrounded by sharks has admitted that he was an \\"idiot\\" to attempt the foolhardy feat. Harrison Williams, 26, was on a boating excursion with friends off the coast of Western Australia over the weekend when they came across the dead whale. \\"Out on the boat with the boys and one of my mates thought it'd be pretty funny if I surfed the whale, so I just did it,\\" Williams told CNN affiliate Seven Network. He launched himself into the water and clambered onto the rotting carcass. But his friends' mirth quickly turned to horror when they noticed all the sharks swimming around the whale, feasting on its flesh. \\"Hazza! There's sharks there! Come back!\\" screams one of his friends in a video of the bizarre scene. 'Mum thinks I'm an idiot' Several tiger sharks and at least one great white shark were reported to have been feeding on the carcass. Williams said he'd seen the sharks, including the great white, before he jumped in. But that didn't put him off taking the leap. \\"He was too busy chomping on the whale so wasn't too bad,\\" he told Seven Network. But not everyone was impressed. The Department of Fisheries said his behavior was risky and irresponsible, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. And Williams' parents were none too pleased. \\"Mum thinks I'm an idiot, Dad's not too proud either,\\" he said. He said he now agrees with their assessment and is \\"pretty grateful to still be alive.\\" Carcass brings threat to beach. Authorities say that because the whale was dead and Williams didn't remove any part of it, he won't be fined for his actions, Seven Network reported. The carcass has since washed up on a beach at Scarborough, a suburb of the city of Perth, apparently drawing sharks with it. Authorities said they had closed that beach and two others nearby, with sharks sighted in the vicinity. Williams, meanwhile, says he won't be trying any similar stunts again. \\"I've done it,\\" he said. \\"Don't need to do it again.\\" Could dead whales explode?

Harrison thought it would be fun to jump off the boat and climb onto the whale, like it was a big surfboard. But there were also scary sharks around who were eating the whale. His friends saw the sharks and got scared for him. They screamed for him to go back to the boat. Some of the sharks were really big and dangerous. Harrison said he saw the sharks too but still wanted to climbing onto the whale. People said what he did was dangerous and silly. Even his mom and dad were not happy with him. They thought he was an idiot. Later, Harrison agreed with his parents, realizing it was not a good idea. He's just happy to be safe and alive now. The big dead whale afterwards floated to a beach. Since it smelled of food for them, it attracted these sharks towards the beach. So, the people had to close the beach to keep everyone safe. Harrison says he won't do something like this again. He learned his lesson and realized he doesn't need to take silly risks.

Write an article based on this summary: Actor Benedict Cumberbatch is to read a specially written poem at the reburial service for King Richard III.","output":"Title: Benedict Cumberbatch Honors King Richard III with a Special Poem at Reburial Service Introduction Acclaimed actor Benedict Cumberbatch, known for his versatile acting skills and distinctive voice, is set to pay homage to King Richard III at his reburial service. Many may recognize Cumberbatch from his starring role as Sherlock Holmes in the hit BBC series, \\"Sherlock.\\" However, his latest performance will take a more somber and historical tone, as he will read a specially written poem to pay tribute to the last Plantagenet king at the 530-year-old monarch's reburial ceremony. Step 1: Background of King Richard III's discovery and reburial In 2012, after the discovery of King Richard III's remains underneath a parking lot in Leicester, England, the city began planning a reburial service for the long-lost king. After years of scientific research and historical study, a suitable resting place was found, and the reinterment is scheduled to take place in a solemn religious ceremony. Step 2: Explaining Benedict Cumberbatch's involvement Benedict Cumberbatch's participation in the reburial service of King Richard III holds significance not just because of his fame as an actor, but also due to a recent discovery that links him with the king. Genetic testing revealed that Cumberbatch is a third cousin, 16 times removed, of King Richard III, establishing a shared bloodline between the two. Step 3: The specially written poem The poem, commissioned by the Leicester Cathedral and written by the renowned poet and playwright, Carol Ann Duffy, will honor the life and legacy of King Richard III, as well as acknowledging the historical significance of these events. Benedict Cumberbatch, with his captivating voice and profound command of language, is the perfect choice to deliver this heartfelt tribute to his ancestor. Step 4: The impact of the poem and ceremony Benedict Cumberbatch's reading of the poem will be a pivotal moment during the reburial service. In a time when the legacies of historical figures are continuously examined and reevaluated, this special tribute serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving our past and recognizing the influence of historical events on our lives today. Conclusion As Benedict Cumberbatch reads the carefully crafted poem at the reburial service for King Richard III, the occasion will not only lead us to reflect on the life of a powerful and influential figure in British history, but also remind us of the significance of uncovering and examining our own personal connections to the past. It is a momentous occasion that brings people together to remember, revisit, and rediscover history, and with Cumberbatch's moving tribute, King Richard III's legacy will be honored in a fitting and unforgettable way."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, the question is about seeing through a \\"clear\\" medium, not an opaque one. While an opaque medium could cause difficulty in seeing through it, the question specifically asks for a clear medium, and thus this option is not suitable. D. Thick: A thick clear medium can cause a person's vision to be distorted as light travels through it. Thick mediums can cause light to refract or bend, leading to a distorted view of objects on the other side. Even though the medium is still clear, the thickness can make it more difficult to determine the shape, size, and details of objects on the other side. Therefore, this option is the most suitable for explaining why someone might have a hard time seeing through a clear medium. E. Misunderstood: This term refers to unclear communication or a concept that is not properly understood. While someone might potentially misunderstand the properties of a clear medium, this option doesn't address the central concern of seeing through the medium itself, so it is not the most suitable answer to the question. In conclusion, out of all the given options, \\"D. thick\\" is the most suitable choice for explaining why someone might have a difficult time seeing through a clear medium, as the thickness can cause light refraction and distortion, making the objects on the other side difficult to discern."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Dracula Context: In Whitby, England in 1913, Count Dracula (Frank Langella) arrives from Transylvania via the ship Demeter one stormy night. A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home, and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride. After a surreal \\"Wedding Night\\" sequence (employing lasers and shot by famed James Bond title sequence designer, Maurice Binder), Lucy, like Mina before her, is now infected by Dracula's blood. However, the two doctors manage to give Lucy a blood transfusion to slow her...","output":"...transformation into a vampire. Aware that Dracula is the cause of this supernatural affliction, Van Helsing, Seward, and Harker devise a plan to confront and defeat the Count. They deduce that Dracula must return to his coffin before sunrise to maintain his immortality, so they decide to locate his resting place and confront him there. Upon searching Carfax Abbey, the trio eventually discovers Dracula's hidden lair. Van Helsing confronts Dracula, who initially seems to have the upper hand in their confrontation. However, Van Helsing's strong determination to avenge Mina's death and save Lucy ultimately gives him the strength he needs to face the powerful vampire.  During the climactic battle between Dracula and Van Helsing, Van Helsing manages to gain the upper hand, and in a desperate attempt to destroy Dracula, he impales the Count on a wooden stake. The stake pierces Dracula's heart, causing him to crumble into dust. As Dracula turns into dust, Lucy returns to her normal state, and the curse of the vampire is lifted from her. In this film adaptation of \\"Dracula,\\" it is Professor Abraham van Helsing, played by Laurence Olivier, who ultimately defeats the titular vampire and turns Dracula into dust, thus saving Lucy from the same fate as his daughter, Mina. Van Helsing's extensive knowledge of vampire lore, coupled with his determination and courage, allows him to prevail against the powerful Count Dracula, breaking the vampire's hold on Lucy and avenging Mina's death in the process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: The area was once territory of the Norridgewock Indians, a band of the Abenaki nation. Early visitors describe extensive fields cleared for cultivation. The tribe also fished the Kennebec River. French Jesuits established an early mission at the village, which was located at Old Point. But Father Sebastien Rale , appointed missionary in 1694, was suspected of abetting the tribe's raids on English settlements. Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. British troops attacked the village in 1705 and again in 1722, but both times Father Rale escaped into the woods. But on August 23, 1724, during Father Rale's War, soldiers attacked the village unexpectedly, killing 26 warriors and wounding 14, with 150 survivors fleeing to Canada. Among the dead was Father Rale. Settled by English colonists about 1773, the land would be surveyed in 1791. In 1775, Benedict Arnold and his troops would march through Norridgewock Plantation, as it was known, on their way to the ill-fated Battle of Quebec.   The town had originally been settled under the name \\"Norridgewock Falls.\\" This was later changed to \\"Bernardstown,\\" after the major land owning family, the Bernards. It was then officially incorporated on March 7, 1804, the town was named after United States president James Madison. Farming was an early industry, with hay and cattle the principal products. The native rock is slate, and a quarry was established to extract it. Because of the region's abundant forests, lumbering developed as an industry, with four sawmills operated by water power on the Kennebec. Here the Norridgewock Falls drop 90 feet  over a mile, which attracted other manufacturers as well. In the 19th century, the small mill town had factories which produced carriages, window sash, window blinds, doors and coffins. Question: How many more survivors left the village than were wounded? Answer:","output":"There were 150 survivors who fled the village, and 14 people were wounded. To find the difference, we can subtract the number of wounded people from the number of survivors: 150 - 14 = 136. So, 136 more survivors left the village than were wounded."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Now, I have a new situation: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable.

Instead, focus on keeping an emotional distance from them. Keep that intention in mind as this person acts out in anger. Avoid becoming agitated, raising your voice, or fighting with the person. Instead, actively think about skills you can use to help the other person regulate the situation enough to have a balanced conversation.   Remember that anger is always rooted in someone’s personal pain. It’s not about you, even if the person is taking out their feelings on you. You are not responsible for diffusing their anger. If they are not willing to work toward calm, disengage as soon as possible. People tend to mimic the behavior of those around them. Keeping calm may help the other person to slow or stop their anger. Even if the other person is shouting at you, respond to them as calmly as you can. If they are too worked up to communicate rationally, don’t say anything until they quiet down a little. If you raise your voice, you’ll only fuel the person’s anger. Don’t encourage them to fight. Saying something like “Settle down” or “Relax” will probably just make the person angrier. They may resent being told what to do and feel like you are brushing off their problem.  Create a connection with the person by acknowledging their anger instead. Say something like, “It seems like this is really bothering you. Can we talk about it?” or \\"I want to understand how you feel and I think that would be easier if we could talk instead of yelling.\\" If you are in a public place, ask the person if there is somewhere you can go to work out the issue. If you feel nervous going on your own, ask someone along to act as a moderator and serve as your witness. When the person tells you what’s wrong, empathize with them. Make them feel like you’re on their side, even if you don’t agree with them. They will be less likely to turn violent if they feel understood. For instance, you might say something like, “So you’re hurt that no one told you about the change of plans ahead of time, is that right? You feel like no one wanted to include you.” Maintain an open, relaxed posture. Make eye contact with the angry person, but keep your expression non-confrontational. Don’t make animated gestures, put your hands on your hips, or fold your arms. Move slowly and calmly. Give the angry person plenty of space. This also gives you some protection if they do become violent.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of staying calm and maintaining an emotional distance when dealing with an angry person. Rather than taking their anger personally, one should focus on keeping their composure and avoiding actions that may further agitate the situation. It's crucial to understand that anger is rooted in someone's personal pain and is not necessarily directed at you. To have a balanced conversation, one must actively think of skills to help regulate the situation. People tend to mirror the behavior of others, hence staying calm may encourage the angry person to subdue their emotions. It's crucial to respond calmly to any verbal aggression and not engage until the person is calmer. Avoid phrases like \\"settle down\\" or \\"relax,\\" as this may intensify their anger. Creating a connection with the person is key. Acknowledge their anger and try talking it through. If the situation is in a public place, consider going somewhere private to resolve the issue, possibly with a moderator to ensure impartiality. Active listening and empathy are vital when the person explains their grievances, as it helps them feel understood and reduces the chances of violence. Lastly, body language plays an essential role in calming the angry person. Maintain an open and relaxed posture, make eye contact, but keep facial expressions non-confrontational. Avoid aggressive gestures such as putting hands on hips or folding arms, and move confidently but calmly. Give the person space, as this may help alleviate tension and provide some protection if the person becomes violent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: Machete Movie plot: Machete opens along a road through Mexican mesa. A car rides down the road, occupied by two Federales-- Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) and his partner (Vic Trevino). They are en route to rescue a young woman (Mayra Leal) held captive by a ruthless drug lord named Torrez (Steven Seagal), who was once Machete's partner in the Federales. Machete's current partner is furious at the rescue mission, saying that the girl is probably locked up somewhere, heavily drugged, and is just another of many dozens of kidnap victims; they do not need to go and rescue her. Machete calmly asks his partner, 'if not us, then who?'Machete's cell phone rings. His direct superior, the Mexican Federal chief (Alejandro Antonio), angrily orders that they stop and wait for backup to arrive. They are not to disobey orders and storm the place where the girl is believed to be held, alone. Machete takes the phone and crushes it in his hand.Roaring into a small villa, the car stops at a three-story house with barred windows. Three men step out of the house, heavily armed. Machete throws the car into reverse and backs up a number of yards. His partner bravely tells Machete that he is with him, calling him 'boss.' Machete holds up a large, wickedly sharp machete (from which he gets his name) and says in English, 'this is the boss.'Machete then propels his car forward, racing straight toward the house and the men in front of it. They open fire as the car roars toward them, Machete's partner firing back through the windshield. The partner is hit by a hail of gunfire shortly before the car plows through their line. They leap away as the car crashes through the front of the house. Machete apologizes to his partner, who lays dead beside him.Charging into the house, Machete promptly foils an ambush, slicing off the hand of an assailant pointing a gun at him.

Answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The painting known as Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601, or simply The Procession Picture  (see illustration), is now often accepted as the work of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it \\"one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age\\". It is an example of the convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an icon, portraying her as much younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, \\"[t]his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of herself to her adoring subjects\\". George Vertue, the eighteenth-century antiquarian, called the painting \\"not well nor ill done\\".Strong reveals that the procession was connected to the marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen's six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen's Horse in 1601.Peake clearly did not paint the queen, or indeed the courtiers, from life but from the \\"types\\" or standard portraits used by the workshops of the day. Portraits of the queen were subject to restrictions, and from about 1594 there seems to have been an official policy that she always be depicted as youthful. In 1594, the Privy council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen be found and destroyed, since they caused Elizabeth \\"great offence\\". The famous Ditchley portrait (c. 1592), by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, was...

The former bishop explains that a group of barons had arranged the sinking of the White Ship in order to kill the king's son and heir, with the belief that they would be able to influence the succession and gain more independence from the crown as a result. After they learned that Jacques Cherbourg had survived the sinking, the barons had him imprisoned in England to prevent him from exposing their conspiracy. While initially content to leave him there, they eventually chose to have him killed after he learned English and started attracting unwanted attention, hiring Waleran, Percy and James for this end. Finally understanding the truth behind his father's death, Jack is able to put it behind him. Elsewhere, the Pope forces King Henry's public repentance and symbolic subjugation of the crown to the church, in which Philip, now Bishop of Kingsbridge, participates.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who claims \\"I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland\\"? from the following article ?  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout.

Evita is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. It concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Peron, the second wife of Argentine president Juan Peron. The story follows Evita's early life, rise to power, charity work, and eventual death. The musical began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976. In 1972, Robert Stigwood proposed that Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice develop a new musical version of Peter Pan, but they abandoned the project.  Travelling late to a meal one night in 1973, though, Rice heard the end of a radio show about Eva Peron which intrigued him. As a child stamp collector, he had been fascinated by her image on the Argentine stamps, but was unaware of her significance in Argentina's history. He began research and was introduced by a Cinema International Corporation executive to the Argentine film director Carlos Pasini Hansen who had produced the TV film Queen of Hearts, which had aired in the UK on 24 October 1972. The executive also arranged for Rice to see the film at Thames Television which he did \\"at least twenty times\\" saying also that \\"by that time I had seen Pasini's superbly researched film, I was hooked.\\" The more Rice investigated Eva Peron, going so far as to travel to Buenos Aires to research her life with many documents and contacts that Pasini had supplied, the more fascinated he became by the woman; he even named his first daughter after her.  Rice suggested the idea of a musical based on the subject to Lloyd Webber, but although the idea of writing a score including tangos, pasos dobles, and similar Latin flavours intrigued him, Lloyd Webber ultimately rejected the idea. He decided instead to collaborate with Alan Ayckbourn on Jeeves, a traditional Rodgers and Hart-style musical based on the P. G. Wodehouse character, which proved to be a critical and commercial failure. After Jeeves, Lloyd Webber returned to Rice, and they began developing Rice's proposed musical.  The authors of the 1996 book Evita: The Real Life of Eva Peron claim the musical was based on Mary Main's biography The Woman with the Whip, which was extremely critical of Eva Peron. Though Rice praised the Main biography, it was never officially credited as source material. Rice created a character, Che, to serve as a narrator and Greek chorus. Although he had recently discovered Che Guevara was Argentine, he did not necessarily intend that the character be based upon him, despite inserting specific biographical details into the lyrics that clearly apply to Guevara. When Harold Prince later became involved with the project, he insisted that the actors portraying Che should use Guevara as a role model. In the 1996 film adaptation, the character returned to his more anonymous roots. This was also the case for the 2006 London revival.  Lloyd Webber and the conductor Anthony Bowles presented the musical at the second Sydmonton Festival before making the recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract - Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion.  Question: suppose more exercise occurs happens, how will it affect muscles contracting MORE INTENSELY.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"To answer this question, let's first break down the process of muscle contraction and how exercise comes into play: 1. Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles: The brain sends signals to the muscles to contract, initiating movement. 2. Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles: Actin and myosin are the two proteins that interact to create movement within the muscle fibers. 3. The filaments move when the brain instructs them to: The interaction between actin and myosin filaments, known as the sliding filament theory, is what causes muscle contraction. 4. The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract: As the filaments slide past one another, the muscle fiber shortens, resulting in contraction. 5. Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion: Antagonistic muscle pairs work together to create a full range of motion, with one muscle contracting while the other relaxes, and vice versa. Now, let's consider the effect of exercise: More exercise, especially strength training or resistance training, leads to an increase in muscle strength and size. This occurs through a process called hypertrophy, in which muscle fibers become thicker and stronger in response to the increased workload. So, if more exercise occurs, it will result in muscles becoming stronger and being able to contract more intensely. This is because the increased strength and size of the muscle fibers allow them to generate more force during contractions.

If he does that, then he's going to be scoring lots of runs for Warwickshire, the team are going to be playing for him and we'll be winning games of cricket.\\" Troughton, who first became Bell's Bears team-mate in 2002, has always had a close rapport, strengthened by the fact that he is married to Bell's sister-in-law. But the 37-year-old, who played six one-day internationals for England admits: \\"Anything he's achieved on the field, or I have on or off it, is pretty much separate and has nothing to do with the fact that our two wives are sisters. \\"Within the relationship I've had with him from a very early age, I've got to know what he's all about as a leader. And we're both big and ugly enough to be able to challenge each other in many ways. \\"There are going to be times when you're not going not going to agree but, if it's for the better of the team, then you're willing to have those conversations.\\" The Bears' new backroom set-up was finally unveiled on Monday, a wait of over two months from previous boss Dougie Brown's departure to persuading Lancashire to release Giles from his existing Lancashire contract. It was not until Christmas Day that Giles told his family about his new job back at Edgbaston, four years on from his exit to work as England's limited-overs boss. But, while Bell has been busy sharpening up his T20 skills in Australia's Big Bash, scoring 160 runs in five matches for Perth Scorchers, plans were already being made back at Edgbaston. Giles' main brief is to find the next generation of Bells and Troughtons, leaving the coach and the captain to concentrate on first-team results, especially in the Championship, in which the Bears only won three times in 16 matches last season. \\"It does feel like coming home,\\" said Giles. \\"But I have to be careful with saying that because I enjoyed two really good years with Lancashire and I don't want it to look like I simply shot off when a job came up near my house. \\"The personal aspect was a big one. Being away from home became very difficult in my second year. But the role I have is now different and much broader.

That way Bell can focus on playing cricket and helping their team, the Bears, win games. Troughton and Bell have been friends for a long time, partly because their wives are sisters. But they also know how to keep their friendship separate from their work, which means they don't always have to agree with each other. Giles was only able to join the team recently because he had a contract with another team called Lancashire.

Here is an article: Editor's note: Shane Koyczan is an award-winning Canadian poet, author and performer whose video \\"To This Day\\" has been viewed more than 8 million times on YouTube. He performed at the opening ceremonies of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics and has published three works of fiction: \\"Visiting Hours,\\" \\"Stickboy\\" and \\"Our Deathbeds Will be Thirsty.\\" He spoke at TED2013 in February. TED is a nonprofit dedicated to \\"ideas worth spreading,\\" which it makes available through talks posted on its website. (CNN) -- \\"To This Day\\" had a very small beginning. The poem itself was written in 2009 after rereading a series of notebooks I had written in as a child. I'm fortunate enough to have a grandmother who never throws anything away, and one day, she returned a series of journals I had kept. I didn't pay any attention to them at first. I wondered what possible value could come from revisiting what I had already managed to survive. One day, out of boredom, I picked up a journal and began reading it. I was amazed to discover that in midst of all the darkness surrounding my childhood, there was a still a young boy with a sense of humor. After quickly consuming all of the other texts, I realized that I had been completely neglecting a large chapter of my life simply because I wanted to be done with the pain that I had associated with it. Watch Shane Koyczan's TED Talk I wrote a series of pieces, all exploring my early life, and was not surprised to find that so many people were relating to the material. There was a tremendous sense of agony as I prepared to perform the poems for the first time. I remember wondering why I was willfully about to put myself through these experiences again. It has been such a rewarding journey to rediscover a part of myself that I thought I had long discarded. My band, Shane Koyczan and the Short Story Long, ended up rerecording \\"To This Day\\" for our 2011 album Remembrance Year. The poem quickly became a requested piece from our catalog at live performances, and each time there seemed to be a special silence from the audience. Fans have often remarked that we were telling their story back to them with that piece. I get a lot of mail regarding poems that I've written, but the letters I get in response to this piece are easily the most heartrending. There are people in the world whose endurance staggers me. There are stories that test our hearts. They stretch us out into empathy, and all we can do is feel for these strangers who in an instant feel like family. In 2012, I lent my voice to a project developed by Giant Ant studio for the Dalai Lama Center and their Educate the Heart campaign. The team at Giant Ant were great work partners, and they offered to lend me their services for a project down the road. It didn't take long to pick a project: \\"To This Day\\" was a piece I was wanting to do something special with for a long time. Giant Ant put together an animated video call out to other animators and the response we got was overwhelming. The team did an incredible job of threading the animations together to create the finished video.

A:","output":"Relaxed B: Scared C: Relieved D: Anxious To accurately answer the question \\"How would Alex feel afterwards?\\", we need to analyze the given situation: \\"Alex started to run faster when the dog started to bark at him.\\" In this scenario, we can infer that Alex may have been frightened or startled by the dog's barking, which prompted him to run faster. As a result, we can assume that Alex might not have felt comfortable or at ease during this encounter. Now, let's explore the given answer options: A: Relaxed - This option suggests that Alex would feel calm and at peace after the encounter. However, considering that he had to run faster due to the dog's barking, it is less likely for him to feel relaxed immediately afterwards. It is not impossible, however, that after some time and distance from the incident, he might regain a state of relaxation. B: Scared - This option indicates that Alex would still feel frightened after the incident. It is a plausible answer, particularly if the dog's barking left a lasting impression on him. C: Relieved - This option suggests that Alex would feel a sense of relief after the encounter, possibly because he managed to run away from the dog and avoided any potential harm. This answer is more fitting than \\"relaxed,\\" as it takes into account the emotional turmoil brought on by the barking dog. D: Anxious - This option implies that Alex would feel uneasy or apprehensive after the incident. It is also a plausible answer, as the encounter with the barking dog could leave him feeling on edge or worried about encountering similar situations in the future. Based on the analysis, \\"relaxed\\" is not the most valid answer for the question, \\"How would Alex feel afterwards?\\" Although there is a possibility of Alex eventually feeling relaxed after some time and distance from the incident, it is less likely for him to feel relaxed immediately after the encounter given the distressing nature of the situation. More appropriate options could be \\"scared,\\" \\"relieved,\\" or \\"anxious,\\" depending on the lasting emotional impact of the dog's barking on Alex."},{"instruction":"Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: At which college did the quarterback, to whom Connor Cook was a third string backup, play his football ?

Summarize: Guilt can be productive; it can help us grow and mature and, most importantly, learn from our behavior when we offend or hurt others or ourselves. This type of guilt serves a purpose and encourages us to redirect our moral and/or behavioral compass.  For example, if you said something offensive to a close friend over which you feel guilty because it upset them, you will learn not to say those types of things or else you risk losing friends. In other words, you will learn from your mistake. In this sense, then, the guilt has worked productively to positively reshape your behavior.  To give another example, if you feel guilty because you ate an entire bag of chips, that's your brain's way of reminding you about a behavior you probably already know is unhealthy and can adversely affect your well-being. Thus, the rational feeling of guilt motivates you to reflect on and change your behavior for the better. Guilt can also be unproductive, in the sense that you feel guilt even when your behavior doesn't need reflection or transformation. This is irrational guilt that can devolve into a cycle where you begin to feel guilty when there is nothing to feel guilty about and you then ruminate on that guilt.  For example, many first-time parents worry about going back to work because they think leaving their child with a nanny or in daycare will cause unknown damage to their child's mental and physical development. In reality, however, that's just not the case; in fact, most children develop normally irrespective of whether one or both parents work. There's nothing to really feel guilty about in this situation, but many people do, nevertheless. Put differently, this feeling of guilt doesn't produce anything but more irrational guilt.  Unproductive guilt can have adverse effects on your cognitive well-being. For example, you may become overly self-critical, experience low self-esteem, and doubt your self-worth. It is important to recognize that sometimes we feel guilty for things over which we had no control, such as a car crash or not arriving in time to say goodbye to a loved one before he passed. Sometimes people involved in such traumatic events overestimate their knowledge of the event and what they could have done. In other words, these individuals think they could or should have done something but, in reality, could not have. These intense feelings of guilt can produce feelings of helplessness and a feeling of having lost control. For example, perhaps you feel guilty that you survived a car accident, while your friend was killed. This is known as survivor's guilt, which often emerges when we try to explain and make sense of traumatic events that we experience. In the case of serious guilt, you may want to seek professional help from a therapist who can help you work through your feelings of guilt. Engage in self-exploration to really get in touch with your feelings and to determine that it is guilt that you are experiencing and not another emotion. Studies using MRI scans of the brain have shown that guilt is an emotion that is distinct from shame or sadness. At the same time, these studies show that shame and sadness were often also present and correlate with guilt. Thus, it is important that you spend some time reflecting on your feelings in order to precisely pinpoint what you need to address.  Define your thoughts, feelings, surroundings, and body sensations. You can do this cognitively, through the practice of mindfulness, meaning that you just focus on what you're feeling in that moment without judgement or reaction. Alternatively, you can write your feelings down in a journal. Writing out what you're experiencing can help you clarify those emotions as you try to put them into words. Example: I am feeling overwhelmed today with guilt, and I also feel sad. I can't stop thinking about it. I can tell that I’m stressed because I have a tension headache, tension in my shoulders, and a nervous feeling in my stomach. Think about what is causing these guilty feelings. Again, consider writing everything down to begin the process of working through the feeling of guilt. Here are some examples:  \\"I let Fido out and he got run over by a car. I feel guilty that Fido is now dead because our whole family loved him so much.\\" \\"I didn't study for the exam and I got an F. I feel guilty that I let my parents down because they pay so much for me to go to school.\\" \\"I broke up with Bobby. I feel guilty that he hurts so much.\\" \\"My friend's mom passed away, and my mom is still alive and healthy. I feel guilty because my friend's life is in pieces and mine is perfect.\\" You will have to accept that you cannot change the past or what has happened. Acceptance also involves acknowledging difficulty and recognizing that you are able to withstand painful feelings in the present moment. This is the first stage in dealing appropriately with your guilt and moving forward. It is helpful to tell yourself affirming statements that emphasize acceptance and tolerance. Examples of these statements are:  \\"I know dealing with guilt is hard, but for now I know I can endure.\\" \\"This is difficult, but I can accept what has happened and not fight or avoid this feeling - it is what it is.\\"","output":"In summary, guilt can manifest in both productive and unproductive ways. Productive guilt encourages reflection, growth, and learning from our mistakes or negative behaviors. For instance, feeling guilty for hurting someone's feelings can help us learn to be more sensitive to others, while feeling guilty for indulging in unhealthy food can motivate us to improve our eating habits. In these cases, guilt can be a positive force for behavioral change. On the other hand, unproductive guilt occurs when we dwell on irrational and unfounded feelings of guilt for situations that do not require reflection or change. This type of guilt can lead to a vicious cycle and adversely affect our mental health, causing excessive self-criticism, low self-esteem, and self-doubt. Recognizing the difference between productive and unproductive guilt is essential for our well-being. It is crucial to acknowledge that we may sometimes feel guilty due to circumstances beyond our control, such as accidents or traumatic events. In these cases, it is important to recognize the limitations of our ability to intervene and prevent adverse outcomes. For those struggling with intense feelings of guilt, seeking professional help from a therapist can be beneficial. Self-exploration and self-awareness are fundamental in understanding the origin of guilt, differentiating it from other emotions such as shame or sadness. Utilizing mindfulness techniques or journaling can help in identifying and processing these emotions. Investigating the reasons for these guilty feelings and accepting the past or unchangeable circumstances are essential steps in addressing and coping with guilt. Encouraging self-acceptance and tolerance, through affirming statements, can enable individuals to manage and overcome guilt, leading to emotional growth and healing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose government buying meat for everyone happens, how will it affect Meat production increase means damaging more plant life.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we will follow the following steps: 1. Understand the relationship between government buying meat and meat production. 2. Understand the relationship between meat production and plant life. 3. Determine if there is a net increase, decrease, or no effect on plant life due to an increase in meat production. Step 1: Understand the relationship between government buying meat and meat production. If the government starts buying meat for everyone, it is expected that the demand for meat will increase, as more people will be consuming meat. This increased demand will likely lead to an increase in meat production to meet the new levels of consumption. Step 2: Understand the relationship between meat production and plant life. Meat production, specifically through livestock farming, often requires large amounts of land and resources. This includes land for grazing, as well as the production of feed crops for the animals. Increased meat production may lead to deforestation, as more land is converted to agricultural use for livestock farming, and loss of natural habitats, which can have negative impacts on plant life. Step 3: Determine if there is a net increase, decrease, or no effect on plant life due to an increase in meat production. Based on our understanding of the relationships established in Steps 1 and 2, it can be concluded that if the government buys meat for everyone, leading to increased meat production, it is likely to result in greater harm to plant life. The increased need for land and resources to support livestock farming may lead to deforestation and loss of natural habitats, both of which can negatively affect plant life.

Mihail Sadoveanu (Romanian: [miha'il sado'veanu]; occasionally referred to as Mihai Sadoveanu; November 5, 1880 - October 19, 1961) was a Romanian novelist, short story writer, journalist and political figure, who twice served as acting head of state for the communist republic (1947-1948 and 1958). One of the most prolific Romanian-language writers, he is remembered mostly for his historical and adventure novels, as well as for his nature writing. An author whose career spanned five decades, Sadoveanu was an early associate of the traditionalist magazine Samanatorul, before becoming known as a Realist writer and an adherent to the Poporanist current represented by Viata Romaneasca journal. His books, critically acclaimed for their vision of age-old solitude and natural abundance, are generally set in the historical region of Moldavia, building on themes from Romania's medieval and early modern history. Sadoveanu returned to his administrative job in 1907, the year of the Peasants' Revolt. Kept in office by the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. Bratianu, he served under the reform-minded Education Minister Spiru Haret. Inspired by the bloody outcome of the Revolt, as well as by Haret's moves to educate the peasantry, Sadoveanu reportedly drew suspicion from the Police when he published self-help guides aimed at industrious ploughmen, a brand of social activism which even resulted in a formal inquiry.  Mihail Sadoveanu became a professional writer in 1908-1909, after joining the Romanian Writers' Society, created in the previous year by poets Cincinat Pavelescu and Dimitrie Anghel, and becoming its President in September of that year. The same year, he, Iosif, and Anghel, together with author Emil Garleanu, set up Cumpana, a monthly directed against both Ovid Densusianu's eclecticism and the Junimist school (the magazine was no longer in print by 1910). At the time, he became a noted presence among the group of intellectuals meeting in Bucharest's Kubler Coffeehouse.  In 1910, he was also appointed head of the National Theater Iasi, a position which he filled until 1919. That year, he translated from the French one of Hippolyte Taine's studies on the genesis of artworks. He resigned his office within the Writers' Society in November 1911, being replaced by Garleanu, but continued to partake in its administration as a member of its leadership committee and a censor. He was a leading presence at Minerva newspaper, alongside Anghel and critic Dumitru Karnabatt, and also published in the Transylvanian traditionalist journal, Luceafarul.  Sadoveanu was again called under arms during the Second Balkan War of 1913, when Romania confronted Bulgaria. Having reached the rank of Lieutenant, he was stationed in Falticeni with the 15th Infantry Regiment, after which he spent a short period on the front. He returned to literary life. Becoming good friends with poet and humorist George Topirceanu, he accompanied him and other writers on cultural tours during 1914 and 1915. The series of writings he published at the time includes the 1915 Neamul Soimarestilor.  In 1916-1917, as Romania entered World War I and was invaded by the Central Powers, Sadoveanu stayed in Moldavia, the only part of Romania's territory still under the state's authority (see Romanian Campaign). The writer oscillated between the Germanophilia of his Viata Romaneasca friends, the stated belief that war was misery and the welcoming of Romania's commitment to the Entente Powers. At the time, he was reelected President of the Writers' Society, a provisional mandate which ended in 1918, when Romania signed the peace with the Central Powers, and, as Army reservist, edited the Entente's regional propaganda outlet, Romania. He was joined by Topirceanu, who had just been released from a POW camp in Bulgaria, and with whom he founded the magazine Insemnari Literare. Sadoveanu subsequently settled in the Iasi neighborhood of Copou, purchasing and redecorating the villa known locally as Casa cu turn (\\"The House with a Tower\\"). In the 19th century, it had been the residence of politician Mihail Kogalniceanu, and, during the war, hosted composer George Enescu. During that period, he collaborated with leftist intellectual Vasile Mortun and, together with him and Arthur Gorovei, founded and edited the magazine Ravasul Poporului. what did he do?","output":"Mihail Sadoveanu was a renowned Romanian novelist, short story writer, journalist, and political figure who twice served as acting head of state for the communist republic.

He served in the army during the Second Balkan War and World War I while balancing his literary responsibilities. Despite being torn between Germanophilia and supporting the Entente Powers, he continued writing and editing various magazines and newspapers. Notably, he co-founded the Insemnari Literare magazine with his close friend, George Topirceanu, and the magazine Ravasul Poporului with Vasile Mortun and Arthur Gorovei. In summary, Mihail Sadoveanu was a prominent figure in Romanian literature and culture, contributing to the country's literary landscape with his novels, short stories, and journalistic works.

Compared to a 350 foot tall ocean tsunami, would a one inch ripple in a pond have more energy or less energy?? Answer:","output":"A one-inch ripple in a pond would have significantly less energy as compared to a 350-foot tall ocean tsunami. To gain a deeper understanding of this difference in energy, let's delve into the factors determining the energy of a wave and compare these two types of waves. Wave energy is mainly dependent on factors such as wave height, wave speed, and the density of the water. In both types of water waves, namely the one-inch pond ripple and the 350-foot tall tsunami, the energy per unit width is proportional to the square of the wave height, as stated by the formula: E ~ H² where E is the wave energy and H is the wave height. For the pond ripple, the wave height H1 is one inch, which is about 0.025 meters. E1 ~ (0.025)^2 E1 ~ 0.000625 square meters For the ocean tsunami, the wave height H2 is 350 feet, which is about 106.68 meters. E2 ~ (106.68)^2 E2 ~ 11376.9424 square meters Comparing the two energy values, we can see that the energy of the ocean tsunami (E2) is significantly larger than the energy of the pond ripple (E1). In fact, E2 is around 18.2 million times greater than E1 (11376.9424/0.000625 = 18,203,107.84). Aside from the height differences, other factors also come into play like wave speed, wavelength, and the volume of water involved. In open ocean conditions, a tsunami can travel at a speed of hundreds of kilometers per hour, while a pond ripple moves much slower. Furthermore, the wavelength of a tsunami can be hundreds of kilometers, while the pond ripple covers only a small distance. The sheer volume of water associated with tsunamis also adds to their immense energy. In conclusion, there is no doubt that a 350-foot tall ocean tsunami carries vastly more energy than a one-inch pond ripple, mainly due to differences in height, speed, distance covered, and the enormous volume of water involved in the formation and movement of tsunamis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977, among the first wave of American punk. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom and drummer D.J. Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical reception for their first four albums, the band was frustrated by its lack of wider mainstream success. Zoom had also stated that he would leave the band unless its next album was more successful. The band decided to change producers in search of a more accessible sound. Their fifth record, Ain't Love Grand!, was produced by pop metal producer Michael Wagener. It featured a drastic change in sound, especially in the polished and layered production, while the band's punk roots were little in evidence, replaced by a countrified version of hard rock. The change in production was intended to bring the band more chart success, but although it received more mainstream radio play than their earlier releases, it did not represent a commercial breakthrough. Zoom left the group shortly thereafter in 1986, the same year in which the feature-length documentary film, X: The Unheard Music, was released.  Zoom was initially replaced by Alvin, who had left the Blasters. The band then added a fifth member, guitarist Tony Gilkyson, formerly of the band Lone Justice. By the time the band released its sixth album, See How We Are, Alvin had already left the band, although he played on the record along with Gilkyson and wrote 4th of July for the band. Like Ain't Love Grand, the album's sound was far removed from the band's punk origins, yet featured a punchy, energetic, hard-rocking roots rock sound that in many ways represented a more natural progression from their earlier sound than the previous record had. After touring for the album, X released a live record of the tour, titled Live at the Whisky a Go-Go, and then went on an extended hiatus.  Back in 1984, X had released a cover version of \\"Wild Thing\\" as a non-album single. In 1989, the song was re-released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the hit film Major League. It later became a staple at sporting events, particularly baseball games, and was used by Japanese professional wrestler Atsushi Onita after he founded Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in 1989.

Chapter IX  Nobble   During the two days which Dick and Caldigate spent together in Melbourne Mrs. Smith's name was not mentioned between them. They were particularly civil each to the other and went to work together, making arrangements at a bank as to their money, taking their places, despatching their luggage, and sorting their belongings as though there had been no such woman as Mrs. Smith on board the Goldfinder. Dick, though he had been inclined to grumble when his mystery had been taken out of his hands,--who had, of course, been jealous when he saw that the lady had discarded her old hat and put on new ribbons, not for him, but for another,--was too conscious of the desolation to which he would be subjected by quarrelling with his friend. He felt himself unable to go alone, and was therefore willing that the bygones of the ship should be bygones. Caldigate, on the other hand, acknowledged to himself that he owed some reparation to his companion. Of course he had not bound himself to any special mode of life;--but had he, in his present condition, allied himself more closely to Mrs. Smith, he would, to some extent, have thrown Dick over. And then, as soon as he was on shore, he did feel somewhat ashamed of himself in regard to Mrs. Smith. Was it not manifest that any closer alliance, let the alliance be what it might, must be ruinous to him? As it was, had he not made an absolute fool of himself with Mrs. Smith? Had he not got himself already into a mess from which there was no escape? Of course he must write to her when the month was over. The very weight of his thoughts on this matter made him tamer with Dick and more observant than he would otherwise have been.  1. What woman had been on the Goldfinder? 2. How many days did the friends spend in Melbourne? 3. How many times did they talk about Mrs. Smith during that time? 4. True or False: Caldigate felt that he owed something to Dick. 5. What did he owe? 6. What had Mrs. Smith thrown away? 7. What did she wear that was new? 8. Did she do this for Dick? 9. True or False: Caldigate thought a closer relationship with Mrs. Smith would be disastrous. 10. Who knew he would be lonely if he argued with his friend? 11. Was he inclined to complain? 12. Why? 13. Did the two visit a bank? 14. Did they visit a courthouse? 15. Did Caldigate think he had been silly with the lady? 16. True or False: He felt that any issue caused by this he could easily get out of. 17. When would he send her a letter? 18. Had Caldigate dedicated himself to any set path in life? 19. What, if he had done it, would have betrayed Dick? 20. What did the pair do with their luggage?","output":"1. The woman that had been on the Goldfinder was named Mrs. Smith. 2.

True, Caldigate felt that he owed something to Dick, due to his behavior onboard the Goldfinder and the situation with Mrs. Smith. 5. Caldigate felt that he owed Dick some form of reparation or compensation, recognizing that his alignment with Mrs. Smith would have negatively affected their friendship.  6. Mrs. Smith discarded her old hat. 7. Mrs. Smith wore new ribbons, symbolizing a change or a new beginning. 8. No, she did not put on the new ribbons for Dick.

Erykah Badu was born Erica Abi Wright in Dallas, Texas. Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister Nayrok alone after separating from their father, William Wright Jr. To provide for her family, the children's maternal and paternal grandmothers often helped look after them. Badu had her first taste of show business at the age of four, singing and dancing at the Dallas Theater Center and The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) under the guidance of her godmother, Gwen Hargrove, and uncle TBAAL founder Curtis King. In May 2013, Badu announced she was writing her next project, but not placing a time constraint on it. In July 2014, Badu revealed she was still working on the album and had been recording in April in Africa where she was \\"laying down drum tracks\\". Badu also said that prior to her trip to Africa she would have meetings with her record label to set a deadline for the album. Later that year Badu expanded on the album, stating she was working with producer Flying Lotus, who she met via MySpace years ago; they later met in L.A. at guitarist Steve Wilson's house. In 2015 Badu appeared on \\"Rememory\\", a song from Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment's album Surf. In July 2015, Badu released a free mixtape of her favorite recordings, describing the set as \\"carefully and lovingly selected high frequency tones for the soul.\\" The mixtape features mostly vintage funk, soul and jazz songs. On March 26, 2015, Erykah Badu performed at The Bomb Factory in her hometown, Dallas, Texas, for the Deep Ellum venue's grand opening. The sold-out show also featured fellow Dallas native, singer-songwriter Sarah Jaffe.  In early October, Badu released a remix of Drake's single \\"Hotline Bling\\", and later released a mixtape, But You Caint Use My Phone, on November 27, 2015, making it available for digital download and streaming exclusively through Apple Music. After one week of exclusive release on iTunes, But You Caint Use My Phone was released to other digital retailers and streaming services on December 4, 2015. The mixtape was released without the knowledge of her label Universal, due to Badu sending the record straight to iTunes. It also marked Badu's first release under her own record label, Control Freaq. But You Caint Use My Phone received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, selling 35,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Badu also hosted the 2015, 2016 and the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards.  Badu held her annual \\"Still Boomin'\\" sold-out birthday bash concert at The Bomb Factory on February 26, 2016, marking her second performance at the venue since its grand opening 11 months earlier. The event was hosted by Badu's close friend Dave Chappelle and featured a surprise appearance by Outkast frontman Andre 3000. Badu enlisted Dallas local hip hop acts -topic, Zach Witness, and Cameron McCloud as her supporting acts.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else did she do in 2015?","output":"In 2015, Erykah Badu appeared on \\"Rememory\\", a song from Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment's album Surf.

Identifying relevant evidence from the provided context: Analyzing the context, we found that the texts \\"Penelope wanted to have a party\\", \\"She wanted to bring a lot of girls together\\" and \\"Penelope had to ask everyone to leave\\" are important as they refer to the quantity of people.  2. Interpreting the evidence: The phrase \\"a lot of girls\\" may suggest a considerable group of people was invited. Furthermore, Penelope had to ask \\"everyone\\" to leave, which gives us an impression that more than a few people were present. 3. Formulating the hypothesis: Thus, based on the interpretation of the evidence, the hypothesis \\"There was a lot of people at the party\\" can be drawn.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: After you've had a relapse, whether it was just bumming one cigarette at a party or smoking an entire pack during a rough day, it's time to sit back and ask yourself why it happened. Understanding why you had a relapse is the key to preventing future relapses. Here are some questions you should ask yourself:  Did you have a relapse because you were feeling stressed? If so, you should think more about how you can minimize your stress, or avoid particularly stressful situations. For example, if you had a cigarette because of a stressful day at work, find a way to deal with another stressful day at work, such as having ice cream or watching your favorite movie after work instead. Did you have a relapse because you were in a situation that made you want to smoke? If you had a cigarette at your friend Beth's party because you associate her parties with having a nice cool smoke on the back porch, then you should either avoid her parties for a while or come equipped with gum, a dessert, or a game plan for beating the craving. What were you feeling right before you relapsed? Recognizing those feelings can help you fight them in the future. This is an important point. Just because you had one cigarette or relapsed for a day doesn't mean you should think you're a failure and give up entirely. Don't use the relapse as an excuse to go back to smoking. Just because you had a moment of weakness doesn't mean that you're a weak person and that you don't have the skills to quit.  Just do what you've been doing. If you've been trying to quit for a while, then your body will be craving cigarettes less than it normally would, even if you've had a relapse. Be extra vigilant after the relapse. For the week after the relapse, try harder than ever to stay busy and active, to avoid temptation, and to manage your stress. There's a reason only 3 -10% of people can successfully quit smoking cold turkey. It's tough. If you've been trying to quit cold turkey for months or even years but always relapse or even fall into long periods when you resume your regular smoking routine, then cold turkey may not be the best method for you. Here are some other great methods to try:  Behavioral therapy. A behavioral therapist will help you find your triggers, provide support, and can help you decide the best way to quit. Nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, and sprays are ways of giving your body nicotine without the tobacco. This is a good way of weaning your body off off nicotine instead of quitting all at once. Medication. See your doctor about getting a prescription for a medicine that will help you quit smoking. Combination treatments. Behavioral therapy, replacement therapy or medication, and ample support from friends and family can be the best way to ensure that you will truly quit smoking for good.

Let me give you a summary of this article: The article talks about what to do after you have a relapse while trying to quit smoking. It is important to understand why the relapse happened so you can avoid it in the future. You should think about managing stress, avoiding situations that make you want to smoke, and recognizing your feelings before the relapse. Don't give up just because you had a moment of weakness. Stay focused and try different techniques like behavioral therapy, nicotine replacement, medication, or a combination of them to help you quit smoking for good."},{"instruction":"Who is this American singer, songwriter, and interpreter of music who was featured in \\"Standing in the Shadows of Motown\\" and contributed to \\"Crying on Sunday?\\" Answer:","output":"Joan Osborne"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: A Christmas Carol Movie plot: Old Ebenezer Scrooge is a cruel man for whom life's only passion has become only money; he hates Christmas, even the very mention of it, lives alone and only to work. He is very strict with his only, underpaid and overworked, employee, Bob Cratchit, and does not believe in giving away to charity or being kind to anyone. One Christmas Eve, Ebenezer Scrooge receives a ghostly visit from his long deceased partner Jacob Marley, who had died exactly seven years before on that same day. In his life, Jacob Marley had been just as selfish and uncaring as Scrooge was now. He tells Ebenezer about how his soul has not had a moment's rest since his death and how his spirit has been doomed to wander the earth looking down at what might have been, had he been a different man. He tells Scrooge that he wants to spare him that same fate, and that on that night, he will receive the visits of three spirits. After Jacob departs, Scrooge heads for his bed with no intention of having his sleep be interrupted by anyone. Still, precisely as Jacob Marley had predicted, the first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past arrives at one o'clock. He and Scrooge depart together for the Christmases that have already been, and from the experience, Scrooge gains a painful memory of the person he was, and how he became what he is today. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shares with Scrooge the Christmases being celebrated on that same year, especially the merriment being had at his nephew Fred's home; Fred had invited him to dinner, and Scrooge, as usual, had declined the invitation. From this experience, Scrooge also learns about Bob Cratchit's family, and how his youngest son, Tiny Tim, is a fragile creature supported by a crutch who may be doomed to die unless he receives better nourishment, more than his father can provide.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.)  Jeremy is performing some chores around the kitchen when he decides to pour himself some water into a blue cup. However, this water isn't cold enough so he puts it into the freezer to cool it down. He then pours himself the exact same amount of water in a red cup, but gets a phone call and leaves that cup on the table without taking a sip. He comes back two hours later after the phone call to get his cups of water back.  Which cup is more likely to get a crack in it? A:","output":"A: The blue cup is more likely to get a crack in it. When Jeremy placed the blue cup with water in the freezer, the temperature of the water decreased, causing it to change from liquid to solid ice. As the water in the blue cup froze, it expanded in volume, putting pressure on the cup's structure, which could potentially lead to the formation of cracks. On the other hand, the red cup with water left at room temperature remained in its liquid form and did not undergo any significant changes in volume, so it is less likely to get a crack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Chemical Brothers are an English electronic music duo composed of Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, originating in Manchester in 1989. Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. In the UK, they have had six number one albums and 13 top 20 singles, including two number ones.  - Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars is the third studio album by British big beat musician Fatboy Slim. It was released on 6 November 2000 through Skint Records. It features Macy Gray, Ashley Slater, Bootsy Collins, Roland Clark, Jim Morrison, and Roger Sanchez as guest contributors. The album's title, mentioned in the single \\"Weapon of Choice\\" is an allusion to the Oscar Wilde quote \\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars\\".  - Skint Records is a Brighton based dance music record label owned by JC Reid, Tim Jeffery and Damian Harris. It was created as a sublabel of Loaded Records, also founded by Reid and Jeffery. Along with Wall of Sound, the label was a leader in the big beat music scene of the mid to late 1990s.   - Roland Clark is a house music DJ, producer, songwriter and vocalist. In the past, he has used the aliases Jesus Jackson, Digital Pimps, Dark Clark, South Street Player, and is also founding member of the dance music project Urban Soul. He learned how to write songs from his childhood mentor Calvin Gaines.  - Breakbeat as a term refers to one of two distinct things. Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well.  - Propellerheads were a British big beat musical ensemble, formed in 1995 and made up of electronic producers Will White and Alex Gifford. The term \\"propellerhead\\" is slang for a nerd, and when Gifford and White heard a friend from California use this in a conversation, they thought it would be the perfect name for their band.  - The Prodigy are an English electronic music group from Braintree, Essex, formed by Liam Howlett in 1990. The members were originally Liam Howlett (keyboardist and composer), Keith Flint (dancer and vocalist), Maxim (MC and vocalist), Leeroy Thornhill (dancer and occasional live keyboardist), and a female dancer and vocalist called Sharky, however, both Leeroy and Sharky left the band for different reasons.  - Big beat is an electronic music genre that usually uses heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns - common to acid house. The term has been used since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe music by artists such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Cut La Roc, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada.  - \`\` Sunset ( Bird of Prey ) '' is a song by the British big beat artist Fatboy Slim , released from his 2000 album Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars . The single peaked at No. 9 in the UK and No. 77 in Switzerland . The song samples Jim Morrison 's vocals from the Doors song \`\` Bird of Prey .

Due to his lyrics, wild personality, performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and death, Morrison is regarded by critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock music history.  - Groove Armada are an English electronic music duo, composed of Andy Cato and Tom Findlay. They achieved chart success with their singles \\"I See You Baby\\" and \\"Superstylin'\\". The group has released eight studio albums, four of which have charted in the UK Albums Chart top 50.  - Basement Jaxx are an English electronic music duo consisting of Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe.

As the \\"British Hit Singles & Albums\\" book duly noted \\"they surfaced from the underground house scene, are regular transatlantic club chart-toppers and won the BRIT Award for Best Dance Act in 2002 and 2004\\".  - Lee Potter (born 4 January 1972), known by his stage name Cut La Roc, is a British electronic musician, considered as a pioneer of big beat, a genre fusing elements of  hip hop, house and rock  - Macy Gray (born Natalie Renée McIntyre; September 6, 1967) is an American R&B, jazz and soul singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actress, known for her distinctive raspy voice, and a singing style heavily influenced by Billie Holiday.  - Acid house is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. The style was defined primarily by the deep basslines and \\"squelching\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.    What entity does 'sunset ' has the relation 'record label' with?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: This startup's outlets can make your smart home even smarter As I walk into my master bedroom, a bedside table lamp turns on. Five minutes after I exit it turns off. The same thing happens downstairs when I enter the guest room of my home to put away sheets. It feels very much like I live in the future. When it works. I’m testing a 160 package of three outlets from a startup called Zuli. The outlets allow me to plug in any device and turn it on and off remotely, set schedules, gather energy consumption, and, if the device is a lamp, I can dim it. But the real magic comes into play when you have three of these outlets plugged into your home, because then they can track where you are and offer presence awareness. Presence is big. To get to a truly smart home, devices need more context, and knowing where people are in the home is a crucial piece of context. For example, one of the most popular Internet connected devices in the home is probably the Nest thermostat. It can sense when you are home or away based on a proximity sensor in the thermostat. But because thermostats are usually located in out-of-the-way locations, a lot of people find themselves working away in an isolated corner of the house only to realize their thermostat has switched to away mode because they haven’t walked in front of the thermostat in a while. Another popular application for better presence is turning on lights. Motion detectors work, but if someone is still, the lights can turn off. With presence based on Zuli’s outlets, that use Bluetooth communicating with your phone, the lights won’t turn off unless your phone exits the room. There are dozens of use cases for finely tuned presence detection in the home, especially if the devices offering that precise detection are open to sharing that information with other connected products and services through an application programming interface (API). Zuli isn’t there yet. But neither is any other company with products on the market at the moment. First off, Zuli’s outlets work with Bluetooth, and today you need your phone (specifically an iPhone) to communicate with the outlets. This means the presence detection only works when your phone is in your pocket and for people who have their phone (running the Zuli app) on them. I found in living with the outlets for a week that the experience was a bit uneven. Sometimes my light turned on as I walked into the room, but other times it would turn on about 10 feet away from the door. In a worst case scenario I’d have to walk about six feet into the room before the light would turn on. I also noticed that when I set the light to turn off after I left, if I didn’t go into a room with another Zuli outlet in it, the system wouldn’t always register that I had left the room and left the light on. When I had my phone and everything worked, it was like magic. It was exactly how I wanted my home to perform and it avoided a lot of the rules and programming issues that come with the motion sensors I’ve tried previously. However, it drained my battery quite a bit, and I was also frustrated because I wanted to use the presence information from the outlets to trigger other smart home devices, like my light switches. I don’t have that many lamps to trigger in my home. Zuli co-founder and CEO Taylor Umphreys says the company is considering how it might create a way to share presence information, and it currently has an integration with the Nest thermostat so the outlets can act as a presence sensor to help keep your Nest from going into Away mode when you are at home. I’d like to see something a little more open-ended like an If This Then That channel, but that’s not in the plans right now, according to Umphreys. However, even with the flaws I think if you’re in the market for a stand-alone smart home product (or one that works with Nest) and are interested in connected outlets, these compare well with existing options on the market. They have more features for the price than the Belkin Wemo Insight outlets, which also offers energy monitoring but lacks the lamp dimming capability and presence features. Once you start playing with presence you start seeing how compelling a smart home will be. And how truly far off we are from one.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: What does a person need to figure out when they have questions?  Choices:  - dedication - surprised - solutions - confidence - compliments  The rationale to choose \\"solutions\\" as the answer is that:","output":"Solutions are the most appropriate choice when a person is trying to figure out something when they have questions. This selection is the best fit as it suggests specifically addressing and resolving the doubts or issues raised by the individual's inquiries. Dedication, surprise, confidence, and compliments are factors that may contribute to the overall process, but they do not directly address the core question. The rationale for choosing \\"solutions\\" as the answer over the other options can be understood by analyzing each choice separately. 1. Dedication: While dedication is an important quality that can drive a person to work towards finding answers, it is not a direct solution for the questions they have. Dedication refers to being committed and persistent in the pursuit of a goal. It may help an individual to stay focused and not give up when facing challenges or difficulties in finding answers, but it does not resolve their questions directly. 2. Surprised: Surprise is an emotional reaction that comes from being presented with unexpected, new, or startling information. Though it might help the person recognize that they have questions that need answering, surprise is not a factor that will help in finding solutions to those questions directly. It may encourage a person to search for information or seek clarification, but it doesn't offer a direct path to understanding. 3. Solutions: When a person has questions, they are essentially seeking resolution and understanding. Solutions offer the necessary answers and explanations they need to put their doubts or uncertainties to rest. A solution directly addresses the questions being asked, providing the person with the knowledge or methods required to overcome the issue at hand. Therefore, \\"solutions\\" is the most fitting answer choice because it directly satisfies the individual's need for clarity on their questions. 4. Confidence: Confidence is a feeling of self-assurance and belief in one's own abilities. It is essential in various aspects of life and can help a person face challenges more effectively. However, confidence alone does not help in finding answers when a person has questions. Confidence may help them be more assertive and more willing to seek help, but it doesn't necessarily lead to direct solutions. 5. Compliments: Compliments are expressions of praise and approval, which can boost a person's self-esteem and morale. However, they do not offer tangible answers or solutions to the questions that a person has. While compliments may foster a positive environment that encourages open communication and information-seeking, they do not provide the actual resolution needed to address the inquiries directly. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"solutions\\" as the answer when a person has questions is that it is the most direct and effective option in helping an individual find the answers they seek. Solutions address the underlying doubts, uncertainties, or issues raised by the person's questions, providing them with the necessary understanding and resolution they need. The other choices, such as dedication, surprise, confidence, and compliments may play a role in the overall process, but they do not contribute to the direct resolution of the questions being asked."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The people living in this area face numerous challenges such as unemployment, crime, and lack of basic necessities. Step 2: Introduce the main character. We meet our protagonist, a young, creative, and ambitious individual named Alex who dreams of a better life away from the poverty they have known all their life. Step 3: Introduce the carnival. The plot thickens when a carnival arrives in town, bringing with it a sense of excitement, joy, and magic to the otherwise bleak environment. The carnival's arrival is a significant event in the neighborhood, as it offers a brief escape from the harsh realities of life in poverty. Alex is intrigued by the carnival and sees it as a chance to experience something new and potentially life-changing. Step 4: Create a conflict. The conflict arises when Alex discovers a hidden secret within the carnival, perhaps uncovering an underground talent show or a magic act that promises to change their life. As they become more involved in this hidden detail, they face challenges such as navigating the competitive environment and balancing their newfound passion with the responsibilities they have towards their family and community. Step 5: Develop the character's growth and relationships. Throughout the movie, Alex forms relationships with other carnival workers and performers, all of whom have a unique story to tell. These connections help Alex grow and learn valuable skills and lessons, ultimately leading them to reevaluate their own life and community. Step 6: Climax and resolution. In the climax of the film, Alex faces a decision - either remain in the carnival or return home to help improve the impoverished neighborhood using the skills and connections they have gained. The film concludes with Alex choosing to embrace both the magic of the carnival and their responsibilities towards their friends and family. They use their newly acquired knowledge and talents to uplift the community and bring a newfound sense of hope and happiness to the neighborhood. Step 7: Conclusion. The plot of the movie serves as an inspiring story of personal growth, the power of community, and the possibility of finding magic in unexpected places.

He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.  The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog. He is accidentally killed trying to escape the authorities.

Sing Sing A:","output":"Title: Echoes of Sing Sing Genre: Crime/Drama/Mystery Plot Summary: Set in 1967, 'Echoes of Sing Sing' tells the story of Martha Bennett and Ray Turner, two deeply devoted and passionate lovers embroiled in a life of crime and deceit. Facing an unjust and twisted society, the couple unwillingly ends up on a tragic path that leads to their execution at the notorious Sing Sing Prison. Act 1: Our story begins with a flashback of Martha and Ray as idealistic, young adults living in New York City. Both struggle to make ends meet - Martha as a waitress and Ray as a mechanic. They meet at a city park, quickly fall in love, and dream of a better life outside the confines of their impoverished existence. However, unbeknownst to Martha, Ray is coerced into joining a notorious crime syndicate led by Vincent \\"The Viper\\" DeMarco. Act 2: Martha and Ray's two worlds soon collide, as they start a family and try to build a life together. They are happy for a time, despite the constant looming shadow of Ray's criminal activities. Vincent uses his leverage over Ray to force him into increasingly dangerous and morally compromised situations. Meanwhile, a detail-oriented and relentless detective named Michael Donovan starts investigating the crime syndicate after Vincent's organization is connected to several high-profile cases. Donovan is the classic straight-laced cop who lives and breathes duty, but he finds himself gaining an odd admiration for the love between Ray and Martha, which becomes apparent as his investigation continues. Act 3: With Donovan closing in, Vincent demands that Martha and Ray participate in a big heist to secure their freedom from his ever-tightening grip. Reluctantly, they agree, but the heist goes terribly wrong, and a police officer is killed in the ensuing chaos. Martha and Ray now find themselves on the run, with Donovan hot on their heels. After a thrilling chase through the streets of New York City, Donovan apprehends the couple and arrests them. In a heart-wrenching scene, they are separated and brought to stand trial. Martha and Ray maintain that love was their motivation for getting entangled in a life of crime, and they cling to the hope that the court will show leniency. Act 4: Despite all odds, Martha and Ray are found guilty and sentenced to death, spending their final days at the infamous Sing Sing Prison. Donovan, realizing that their love transcended their crimes, lobbies to have their sentences commuted. Sadly, his efforts are in vain. On the eve of their joint execution, the lovers have a poignant final meeting in which they exchange words of love and heartache, and reflect on their life together. Holding one another's hands, Martha and Ray draw strength from their love and find the courage to face their imminent and tragic end. Epilogue: Years later, Donovan retires and mourns the lost opportunity to save Martha and Ray. He visits their graves, as the movie ends, reminding the audience of the haunting echoes of Sing Sing – a testament to the couple's indomitable love, and the unforgiving nature of fate. The movie 'Echoes of Sing Sing' highlights themes of love, sacrifice, societal injustices, hope, and redemption. Capturing the somber and tragic essence of the characters' lives, it serves as a mirror to the ever-prevalent façade of a just and equal society and reminds us of the powerful, undying devotion between two souls even in the face of overwhelming despair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: On its surface, Monday night’s HBO documentary, “Larry Kramer in Love & Anger,” seems like a perfect postscript to a historic week for gay rights, marked by the Supreme Court’s affirmation of same-sex marriage. The film even culminates in a wedding, with Mr. Kramer, the AIDS activist and playwright, marrying his longtime partner, David Webster. But “In Love & Anger” strikes a very different note from the euphoria that greeted the court’s decision on Friday. From the initial scene of a furious Mr. Kramer shouting “Plague! Plague!,” to the haunting, seemingly antique images of emaciated AIDS patients, it’s a stark reminder of how different things were just two decades ago. Even the wedding scene, filmed in 2013, is bittersweet — it takes place in an intensive care unit, where Mr. Kramer is being treated for complications from a liver transplant necessitated by his H.I.V. infection. He’s so sick he can’t even say “I do” and nods instead. It’s also, of course, a perfectly timed reminder of Mr. Kramer’s outsize role in the great societal shift that led us here. The judge presiding over his wedding says, “Were it not for Larry, this ceremony, in this place, might well not be happening.” It’s a short step from there to say that the federal right to same-sex marriage might not be happening as soon as it has were it not for him. “In Love & Anger,” a brisk and concise 82-minute film, was directed by Jean Carlomusto, a friend of Mr. Kramer’s who is seen tending to him in his hospital room. It’s not hagiographic — Ms. Carlomusto’s interview subjects attest to the stridency, self-righteousness and bullying tactics that, among other things, led to Mr. Kramer’s being kicked out of Gay Men’s Health Crisis, the first of the AIDS activism groups he helped found. It’s thoroughly admiring, however, framing his excesses as a necessary response to circumstances and suggesting that on the big questions he was always right. A number of friends, colleagues and onetime adversaries speak in the film, including Mr. Webster, the writers Calvin Trillin, Will Schwalbe and Andrew Holleran and the theater director George C. Wolfe, who staged a 2011 revival of Mr. Kramer’s best-known play, “The Normal Heart,” at the Public Theater. Much of “In Love & Anger” has an archival and elegiac feeling as Ms. Carlomusto traces Mr. Kramer’s life from his 1940s Connecticut childhood to Yale and his early career in the film industry in the 1960s and ’70s. (Mr. Kramer, 80, speaks almost entirely in older interviews; post 2013 he appears only in still photographs.) When the mysterious syndrome that would be identified as AIDS appears in the 1980s and Mr. Kramer becomes the country’s most prominent activist pushing for government action against the epidemic, the film’s imagery is both achingly familiar and strangely distant — a time capsule of disco fashions and cable-access interviews. The outraged response from many gays to Mr. Kramer’s call for sexual self-discipline in the face of the disease is briefly recapitulated. His pugnacity (to put it mildly) is displayed in a televised debate in which he tells Dr. Anthony Fauci, leader of the federal effort to develop an AIDS cure, “When you say things like that, I hate you.” This primary section of the film contains an unstated corollary to current events: If the past week’s victory for same-sex marriage was predicated on the work of activists like Mr. Kramer, then it’s also true that it would not have happened when it did without the galvanizing scourge of AIDS. As Mr. Wolfe says in the film, “AIDS gave us focus.” The prosaic-sounding title “In Love & Anger” encapsulates a paradox. The film’s subject helped pave the way for marriage equality, and greater gay rights in general, by his example of relentless fury and in-your-face activism. But he also did it, perhaps inadvertently, by promoting the idea of monogamous gay love (for practical reasons) at a time when much of the rest of the country was picturing gay life as an orgiastic free-for-all. It would be interesting to know what Mr. Kramer — acerbic, funny and, by the evidence of the film, a man not possessed of a great deal of sentimentality — feels about the bland optimism of #lovewins.

The conversation started with Emily wishing Ron a happy birthday. Ron, in turn, thanked Emily. Since it was Ron's birthday, Emily jokingly asked when Ron would be treating her and others. This is a common tradition in some cultures where the person who has their birthday treats their friends or family as a way of celebration. Ron replied with 'Soon', which might suggest that he was being evasive or noncommittal about the timing of the treat. Emily humorously pointed this out, insinuating that his 'soon' never arrives, implying that he may have a tendency to procrastinate or avoid following through on commitments.  Ron then, in a teasing manner, commended Emily on her sharpness and questioned why she bothers to ask if she already knows his habits. This may suggest a close friendship between the two since they are familiar with each other's character traits and can humorously point them out without causing offense. The conversation then took a playful turn with Emily expressing mock annoyance at Ron's comment, after which Ron replied that he is 'proud to be' the way he is, thus demonstrating acceptance of his playfully criticized traits. Ron used the angel emoji to show he was making this statement in a light-hearted manner. Emily then humorously told Ron to 'get lost', to which Ron responded by reminding Emily that it was his birthday. Emily acknowledges this and showed acceptance of his behavior because it was his special day. She further encouraged him to 'enjoy', reaffirming her initial well-wishes to him. Finally, Ron expressed his gratitude to Emily for her birthday wish. Overall, the conversation was a casual and friendly exchange full of humor and playful teasing. The discussion centers around Ron's birthday, his perceived propensity to delay tasks or promises (symbolized by the promised birthday treat), and their mutual understanding and acceptance of each other's behavior."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Title: Law Abiding Citizen Movie plot: In a violent 1999 home invasion, engineer Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is forced to witness the rape and murder of his wife and young daughter by Clarence James Darby (Christian Stolte) and his unwilling accomplice Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart). Prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is unable to use DNA evidence (which had been contaminated by police handling) to securely convict both accused, leading to a possibility that he might lose the case should he support Shelton. Unwilling to take a chance on lowering his 96% conviction rate, he chooses to make a deal with Darby (the actual murderer), letting him plead guilty to a lesser charge, in return for testifying against Ames. Ames is falsely found guilty of masterminding the break-in and personally committing both murders and is sentenced to death. Shelton feels betrayed by Rice's actions, as he had pleaded with him not to make the deal and to at least try to convict both of them, and because he chose to release the actual killer. Despite this, Nick reasons that some justice is better than no justice at all. Darby serves his shortened sentence and is released just a few years later. Ten years after the conviction, Ames is executed via lethal injection. Unknown to the prosecutors and the witnesses, the pancuronium bromide used in the execution was replaced with an unknown corrosive substance, possibly strychnine, causing Ames to convulse, hemorrhage, and die an extremely painful death. Upon inspection of the potassium chloride canister, Rice and his colleague see the words, \\"CAN'T FIGHT FATE\\" written on the label. This implicates Darby, as he had spoken the same words to Nick many years before. As the police draw near to arrest an unsuspecting Darby, an anonymous caller alerts him and offers him a way to escape, directing him to a remote location nearby.

Question: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

Both fishing communities there are still prosperous, but the southern one had a couple of bad years, with fish and other marine wildlife becoming more scarce. The southern beach had erosion problems as well. The northern beach recovered, and is suitable for tourism.  and a hint : Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India.

Answer:","output":"Lawrence Boythorn and John Jarndyce are characters in the novel \\"Bleak House,\\" written by Charles Dickens. First published in a serial format from 1852 to 1853, \\"Bleak House\\" is one of Dickens' most celebrated works and a seminal piece within Victorian literature. The novel is renowned for its detailed portrayal of the English legal system, a comprehensive range of characters, and its exploration of both social and moral themes. Lawrence Boythorn is a boisterous, larger-than-life character in the novel. A man of firm principles and demonstrative manners, he is a loyal friend to John Jarndyce. Boythorn's personal history includes a romantic relationship with Lady Dedlock, which ended in heartache. Consequently, Boythorn harbors considerable animosity toward Sir Leicester Dedlock, Lady Dedlock's husband. In the story, his character provides an interesting contrast to the other restrained and rational personalities that populate the novel. John Jarndyce is a much more central character in the narrative of \\"Bleak House.\\" He is a kind and generous man who is involved in the infamous fictional legal case known as \\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\\" This case represents one of the central themes of the novel, which is a critique of the convoluted and burdensome English legal system. John Jarndyce, being the guardian to the novel's protagonist, Esther Summerson, as well as Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, takes on the responsibility of providing for and guiding these orphaned young people. Throughout the novel, John Jarndyce's compassionate nature is contrasted with the self-serving and morally corrupt behavior exhibited by various other characters. He is continuously committed to assisting and providing for those in need, ultimately relinquishing any expectation of personal gain from the \\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\" case. \\"Bleak House\\" is a complex novel, which employs a vast array of characters to explore various aspects of Victorian society.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which players caught touchdowns passes of more than 1-yard and less than 40 yards?","output":"Title: Exploring the Reign of Touchdown Passes: Stars in the 1 to 40-Yard Range Introduction Football aficionados are well aware of the breathtaking long touchdown passes that leave fans in awe. Equally fascinating are the short 1-yard touchdowns that showcase a masterful balance of strategy and precision. But what about the often overlooked, yet immensely valuable achievements of players who caught touchdown passes between 1 and 40 yards? These medium-range touchdown passes highlight the perfect blend of skill, agility, and teamwork on the field. In this article, we will celebrate some exceptional NFL stars who not only caught touchdown passes within this range but also left an indelible mark in the history of American football. Jerry Rice - The Wide Receiver Extraordinaire Recognized as a leading wide receiver in American football history, Jerry Rice dominated the NFL for two decades. Throughout his stellar career, Rice caught numerous touchdown passes within the 1 to 40-yard range, taking the 49ers, the Raiders, and the Seahawks to new heights. With three Super Bowl rings and a plethora of individual records, Rice stands out as a paragon of medium-range touchdown mastery. Larry Fitzgerald - The Ageless Wonder Exemplifying exceptional athleticism and longevity, Larry Fitzgerald carved a niche for himself in the pantheon of the game's greats. As one of the most respected wide receivers, Fitzgerald consistently performed high-level plays – many of which fall between the 1 and 40-yard range. His ability to connect with his quarterbacks, exploit defenses, and bring home touchdowns is a testament to his skills. Antonio Brown - The Dazzling Juggernaut Rapidly climbing the ranks of all-time greats, Antonio Brown continued to amaze spectators with his touchdown catches, making him one of the NFL's most dangerous weapons. Numerous touchdown catches of 1 to 40-yard range are a testament to Brown's unparalleled agility and skill, which over the years, established him as an offensive force to be reckoned with. Cris Carter - The Control Artist Known for his exceptional control on the field, Cris Carter was highly effective in the 1 to 40-yard range. As a wide receiver, his chemistry with quarterbacks resulted in a multitude of touchdowns within this range for the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings. Carter's unmatched ability to slip past defenders and make difficult catches near the sidelines led him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Marvin Harrison - The Record-Smashing Machine Another iconic wide receiver, Marvin Harrison's tandem with quarterback Peyton Manning is the stuff of legends. The duo connected for scores throughout their time in the NFL, with numerous touchdown passes falling in the desired 1 to 40-yard range. The synergy between Harrison and Manning led the latter to break the then-record for most touchdown passes in a single season. Tony Gonzalez - Tight End Titan Changing the perception of tight ends in the game, Tony Gonzalez stands out as one of the most outstanding players in his position. Gonzalez hauled in an impressive number of touchdowns within the 1 to 40-yard range while integrating athleticism and exceptional catching ability that made him one of the deadliest offensive weapons in his prime. Conclusion These aforementioned names represent some of American football's heavyweights, known for their consistently impressive medium-range touchdown passes. Be it Jerry Rice's longstanding records, Tony Gonzalez's dominance as a tight end, or the seemingly ageless Larry Fitzgerald, these players exemplify undeniable talent and the value of working within the crucial 1 to 40-yard range. Idolized and respected worldwide, their careers remind us that sometimes, it’s these medium-range accomplishments that earn a rightful place in football folklore."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A child who has once been pleased with a tale likes, as a rule, to have it retold in almost the same words, but this should not lead parents to treat printed fairy stories as formal texts. It is always much better to tell a story than read it out of a book, and, if a parent can produce what , in the actual situation of the time and the child, is an improvement on the printed text, so much the better. A change made against fairy tales is that they harm the child by frightening him or making him sad thinking. To prove the latter, one would have to show in a controlled experiment that children who have read fairy stories were more often sorry for cruelty than those who had not. As to fears, there are, I think, some cases of children being dangerously terrified by some fairy story. Often, however, this arises  from the child having heard the story once. Familiarity with the story by repetition turns the pain of fear into the pleasure of a fear faced and mastered. There also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that they are not objectively true, that giants, witches, two-headed dragons, magic carpets, etc. do not exist; and that, instead of being fond of the strange side in fairy tales, the child should be taught to learn the reality by studying history. I find such people, I must say so peculiar that I don't know how to argue with them. If their case were sound, the world should be full of mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girl-friend.

Fact 2: Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Creatures Dinosaurs are just one group of prehistoric animals.  Given the two facts above, what does heat and pressure change into natural gas?","output":"Given Fact 1 that heat and pressure change the remains of prehistoric living things into natural gas, and Fact 2 that dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are just one group of prehistoric animals, we can infer that the remains of various prehistoric living organisms can go through the process of transformation into natural gas. Natural gas is a non-renewable fossil fuel that comprises primarily methane and other hydrocarbon gas mixtures. Its formation is a result of the decomposition of organic matter, which includes not just dinosaurs but also ancient marine organisms, plants, and other prehistoric creatures. Over millions of years, these organic materials become buried under layers of sediment, such as sand, silt, and clay. The process of turning organic matter into natural gas involves several stages: 1. Accumulation: The remains of prehistoric organisms accumulate in sedimentary basins, which are areas where layers of sediment build up over time. As these organisms die, their remains fall to the bottom of the basins and mix with other sediments. 2. Burial and compaction: Over millions of years, these layers of sediment become compacted due to the weight of overlying sediments. This compaction causes the temperature and pressure within the sediments to increase. 3. Diagenesis: As the temperature and pressure rise, the buried organic matter undergoes diagenesis. During this stage, the organic material begins to undergo chemical and physical changes, gradually breaking down into simpler compounds such as kerogen. 4. Catagenesis: As the temperature and pressure continue to increase, the kerogen undergoes further transformations, becoming more carbon-rich. Catagenesis results in the formation of hydrocarbon molecules, which include various petroleum liquids (such as crude oil) and gaseous hydrocarbons (such as natural gas). 5. Migration: The newly formed hydrocarbons start moving through the porous rock layers as the temperature and pressure continue to rise. They migrate upwards towards the Earth's surface, where they sometimes become trapped in geological formations, such as anticlines or fault traps. 6. Accumulation: Once the hydrocarbons migrate to a suitable reservoir rock, they accumulate in a concentrated pocket of oil or natural gas, forming a trapped hydrocarbon reserve. 7. Extraction: Humans extract the natural gas from these reserves using various methods, including drilling wells and hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking), which involves injecting a high-pressure fluid into the rock to release the trapped gas. In conclusion, heat and pressure change the remains of various prehistoric living organisms, including dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures, into natural gas under specific geological conditions. This transformation occurs over millions of years, and the resulting natural gas becomes a vital source of energy for human consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the day Apple Inc. became the first U.S. company to close with a market capitalization above 700 billion, Chief Executive Tim Cook credited its success to its ability to sell pricey products to Chinese consumers and ignore commonly accepted beliefs about big companies.      Mr. Cook said Tuesday that Apple has grown rapidly in China by disregarding conventional wisdom that Chinese consumers were too price-sensitive for Apple’s high-end products      ... ||||| NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - Shares of Apple AAPL, -0.63% closed up 1.9% at a new record high of 122.02 on Tuesday, pushing the iPhone maker's market capitalization above 700 billion for the first time. As of Tuesday's close, the Cupertino-based company was valued at 710.8 billion, making Apple the first U.S. company to surpass the 700 billion mark. Apple first traded above 700 billion in intraday trade on Nov. 25, 2014, but this is the first time the stock has closed above it. Since Apple's IPO in December 1980, the company's market value has risen more than 50,600%, with half of that occurring since January 2012, according to Dow Jones Factoids. Apple is now double the size of Microsoft MSFT, -1.03% which is the second-largest U.S. company with a market cap of 347.5 billion. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email      The world’s largest company by market capitalization got a little bit bigger.      Apple Inc., which began flirting with a record valuation of 700 billion during midday trading in November, ended Tuesday at 710.7 billion, marking the first time a U.S. company has reached that milestone.      The stock continued its ascent Wednesday, climbing 1 percent to 123.27 in early trading.      Analysts have a 12-month average target price of 132.56, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The highest target was 165, issued by First Shanghai Securities Ltd. on Feb. 3. Were Apple to reach that mark, the company’s market value would exceed 960 billion.      At Tuesday’s close, the iPhone maker was more than twice as valuable as longtime rival Microsoft Corp. Exxon Mobil Corp., the world’s next-biggest company, has a market capitalization of 385.4 billion.      Optimism about Apple has been growing since Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook revealed larger-screened, more expensive iPhones in September, which helped fuel a record profit during the last three months of 2014. China, where revenue rose 70 percent, is helping to fuel the jump in revenue.      “Given Apple’s powerful iPhone cycle, a big 4G ramp in China and the upcoming launch of Apple Watch in April, we believe there is still plenty to look forward to at Apple during this transformational cycle,” Brian White, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, wrote in a note to investors.

Read this: The apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an \\"abominable mystery\\" by Charles Darwin. However, the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin, and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants, but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. Some older fossils, such as the upper Triassic Sanmiguelia, have been suggested. Based on current evidence, some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms in the Triassic period (245–202 million years ago). Fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the Middle Triassic (247.2–242.0 Ma) suggests an older date for their origin. A close relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes, proposed on the basis of morphological evidence, has more recently been disputed on the basis of molecular evidence that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms.[citation needed] What fossil evidence is lacking when it comes to flowers?

Do \\"them\\" and \\"chairs\\" mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, in this specific context, \\"them\\" and \\"chairs\\" refer to the same entity. The use of the pronoun \\"them\\" is replacing the noun \\"chairs\\" to avoid repetition in the sentence and improve the overall flow of the message. To provide more context and detail in my answer, I will break down the sentence structure: \\"We had hoped to place copies of our newsletter on all the chairs in the auditorium, but there were simply not enough of *them*.\\" Here, the main subject of the sentence is about placing copies of the newsletter. The object of interest, to which the newsletters should be placed upon, is mentioned as \\"chairs.\\" The prepositional phrase \\"in the auditorium\\" provides information about the location of these chairs. The second half of the sentence begins with \\"but,\\" which functions as a coordinating conjunction, used to introduce a contrasting or opposing idea. After this, the sentence continues with \\"there were simply not enough of *them*.\\" In this part, \\"them\\" is a pronoun, acting as a substitute for the noun \\"chairs\\" to prevent repeating the word \\"chairs\\" in the same sentence. Hence, in this particular context, \\"them\\" and \\"chairs\\" mean the same thing. They both refer to the chairs in the auditorium, and the use of \\"them\\" helps to make the sentence more concise, clear, and easier to understand."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

I had driven to town hoping to see the old barber shop where my hair had been cut as a child.       I parked my truck and decided to try and locate a telephone to see if the Florida Barber College had moved to a new location.     After walking about a block I saw an open shoe store. I walked inside and asked if I could use their telephone book. Unable to find a listing for the Barber College, I picked out the number of a local beauty salon, hoping they might tell me if the barber college was still in business. The number was busy, so I decided to wait and try again in a few minutes. As the salesman and I stood talking the front door opened and a young man about twenty came into the store pushing himself in a wheelchair. \\"I need a new pair of shoes,\\" said the customer. As he turned the corner, there was a blanket across his lap. I was shocked to see that the young man had no legs. \\"A gift for a friend?\\" I asked the boy. \\"No,\\" he replied. They are for me,\\" he continued, with a smile on his face. I just smiled back and watched to see what would happen next. \\"What type of shoe would you like?\\" asked the clerk. \\"How about a pair of cowboy boots?\\" The man pointed to the back wall where three or four pairs of boots were displayed. The salesman, sharply turning, headed off to the backroom.  \\"Isn't this fun?\\" the boy asked me. I moved my hand to let him know that I did not understand his question. \\"When I was a kid, my parents used to buy me a new pair of shoes every year. That was such a wonderful feeling. Something I have never forgotten. The smell of the leather and the pride I felt when I walked around the store showing off my new shoes.\\" The salesman came walking down the aisle with a large box. He sat it down on the floor, took out one boot and handed it to the young man. The boy closed his eyes. He placed the boot against his nose, and drew in a large breath.

Article:Last year the number fell by 3% compared with the previous 12 months to 1,282. NHS Blood and Transplant said fewer people were suitable for donating organs and there had been a fall in families giving consent. However, the figures are still considerably higher than a decade ago. A donated heart, kidney or liver can save a life, however, there are massive shortages. The annual Organ Donation and Transplantation Activity Report showed more than 1,200 people either died on the waiting list or were removed because of deteriorating health. Yet now the NHS is reporting a 5% drop in the number of live donors - which include people donating a spare kidney or part of their liver - and the first drop in donations after death for 11 years. The consequence was: There are many potential factors behind the fall, but doctors are being hit by a shrinking pool of potential donors and families being more likely to reject permission for donation. Out of the half a million people who die in the UK each year only a tiny fraction die in circumstances that are suitable for donation. Yet improvements in fields such as stroke and trauma mean patients are more likely to survive and as a result there are fewer donors. The pool of potential donors shrank to 7,450 in 2014-15 from 8,157 the year before. However, families giving consent has also fallen from 59% to 58% including 120 families who went against the deceased person's own wishes to donate. NHS Blood and Transplant is calling for a \\"revolution in attitudes to organ donation\\". Sally Johnson, from NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \\"The decreases we can see across all types of organ transplant will lead to more deaths if we do not reverse this trend. \\"We have always known that because the opportunities to donate are so small, it is essential to increase the number of people who say yes to organ donation. \\"If the pool of potential donors is reduced then this is even more important. \\"We understand that families are expected to consider donation in their darkest hour so we would remind everyone to tell those closest to you now if you want to donate your organs and then record that decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register.\\" Wales is due to become the first part of the UK to change their rules to a system where everyone is presumed to have given their consent for their organs to be donated. People will have to opt out from December 2015. The British Heart Foundation said the rest of the UK needed to follow suit in order to tackle the number of people waiting for a heart transplant, which has doubled in the past five years. The charity's chief executive said: \\"Tragically, these figures show that the number of available organs is outstripped by the number of heart patients waiting for a lifeline. \\"We hope the rest of the UK will follow Wales' trailblazing lead.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"The number of organ donations in the UK fell by 3% last year, according to NHS Blood and Transplant's annual Organ Donation and Transplantation Activity Report.

Summarize this article: University researchers looked at factors on which binge drinking has an effect, such as A&E admissions, road accidents and police officers on duty. The figure, from the universities of Bath and Essex, was worked out by using data from government departments. Dr Jonathan James, of the University of Bath, said he hoped the economic calculation could \\"act as a catalyst for policy makers in the UK\\". The report said more needed to be done to address the social factors leading to binge drinking, which it defined as the consumption of 12 or more units of alcohol in any one period of drinking, typically on a Friday or Saturday night among individuals aged 18 to 30. The research found binge drinking increased the average daily number of injury-related admissions to A&E by 8% - equivalent to 2,504 additional daily admissions nationally. It also caused the average number of road accidents to go up by 17% - equivalent to 82 additional accidents a day nationally - while the average number of alcohol-related arrests increased by 45%, equivalent to 786 additional arrests per day nationally. The problems associated with binge drinking also lead to the number of police officers on duty having to be increased by around 30%, equivalent to an additional 3.2 police officers on duty at the weekend for every 10,000 people in the country, researchers said. Dr Jonathan James, of the University of Bath, said: \\"Much is known about the effects and costs of sustained heavy drinking in relation to increased risks of chronic diseases, the damage to social relationships and the increased burden placed on public services. \\"However, little is known about the economic and social effects of binge drinking. \\"We hope this calculation of the economic costs can act as a catalyst for policy makers in the UK to take targeted action that reduce the cost of binge drinking to society.\\" The figure does not take the long-term costs of binge drinking into account, such as reduced productivity, lost employment and health problems. The study said to offset these costs, policy recommendations such as including a 52 pence minimum unit price for alcohol and an increase in alcohol excise duty directly in line with alcohol strength should be considered. This could see a pint of beer increase by 23 pence, and a bottle of wine by 99 pence.","output":"University researchers found out that when people drink too much alcohol, it can cause problems. They looked at things like how many people had to go to the hospital, how many car accidents there were, and how many police officers had to work because of it. They found out that when people drink a lot of alcohol, all these things go up and it costs a lot of money.

Swapping the bustling political environment of the English capital, the President opted for a more serene setting, indulging in the simple pleasures that the region has to offer. Upon arrival in the picturesque corner of England, the President was enchanted by the distinct charm and hospitality of the locals. In contrast to the intense pressure cooker environment that had come to characterize the President's time in London, visitors and residents alike in this rural region displayed an eagerness to engage in open, friendly conversation. They were delighted to welcome the President into their community, celebrating this historic visit with a warm reception. Taking advantage of the opportunity to experience the quintessential British pastime of afternoon tea, the President visited one of the many rustic tea rooms located in the area. Surrounded by a sumptuous array of scones, finger sandwiches and a selection of the finest teas, the President cheerfully engaged with fellow patrons, getting a true taste of authentic English countryside hospitality. Having satisfied their appetite, the President then proceeded to explore one of the region's iconic establishments, a traditional British pub. Boasting a rich history and a unique décor, the chosen pub epitomized the warm, alluring atmosphere which entices both locals and visitors alike. The President mingled with the patrons while sampling locally brewed ales, regaling them with tales of life in the White House. The pub's landlord greeted the President with a hearty handshake and engaged in light-hearted banter, providing a more candid insight into the daily life of the small community. This seemingly ordinary experience provided the perfect opportunity for the President to escape the high-pressure world of London politics, allowing for a brief respite in vastly contrasting surroundings. In conversations with the local pub-goers, the President demonstrated a genuine curiosity and interest in the lives of the ordinary people, taking the time to ask about their professions, families, and views on various topics. The easy-going atmosphere in the pub encouraged open dialogue, giving the President the chance to connect with the people and gain a deeper understanding of the regional concerns and aspirations. As the sun began to set on the President's short but memorable sojourn to the Northeast of England, they left behind not just the tension of London, but also gained invaluable insights into the lives of the people who call this idyllic region home. With a sense of renewed calm, the President returned to the English capital, ready to face the challenges that awaited them, armed with a newfound appreciation for the simpler things in life. In conclusion, the U.S. President's visit to Northeast England served as a much-needed break from the tensions of London politics, allowing them to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, as well as the traditions, including afternoon tea and a classic British pub experience. It was through these simple and heartfelt interactions with the locals that the President was able to establish a connection and gain valuable insights into the community's way of life. As they returned to London, there's no doubt that the experience would leave a lasting and positive impression on the President."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Can you generate a short summary of the above paragraph?","output":"The Peruvian government is hosting global news conferences, seeking international moral support to extradite former president Alberto Fujimori from Japan, as confirmed by Peru's ambassador to Mexico. These efforts represent the latest move by Peru to bring the controversial former leader back to face various legal charges in his home country. Peruvian diplomats hope that through garnering global support, they can apply additional pressure on Japanese authorities to retain and extradite Fujimori, marking a significant step in their bid for justice. From the perspective of the Peruvian government, Alberto Fujimori's return is essential for the resolution of multiple legal cases tied to his presidency. Fujimori fled to Japan amidst a cloud of corruption allegations and charges of human rights abuses, following his 10-year presidency from 1990 to 2000. His rule was characterised by an autocratic approach and he was found guilty of several charges, including bribery, illegal wiretapping, and human rights abuses, leading to his subsequent 25-year imprisonment sentence, which was delivered in absentia. This international plea for moral support is indicative of Peru's determination to resolve this long-standing issue. Through these news conferences, Peruvian diplomats are likely to emphasise the importance of international law, human rights, and the sanctity of justice, whilst painting Fujimori's evasion of Peruvian justice as a violation of these principles. By doing so, they hope to sway international opinion in their favour and create an environment where Japan might feel compelled to comply with their extradition request. However, it's important to remember that international diplomacy is often dictated by complex political considerations and strategic interests. Japan, as one of the world's most influential economies and a key player on the international stage, might resist bending to international pressure if it sees benefits in harbouring Fujimori. As such, the success of Peru's mission heavily relies on its ability to leverage diplomatic channels, global sympathies, and the rule of law to influence Japan's decision. In conclusion, Peru's ambassador to Mexico's announcement reflects an intensification of Peru's efforts in resolving one of the country's most contentious historical issues. The international news conferences serve as a platform for the Peruvian government to garner global support, apply pressure on Japan, and restore justice to their nation by extraditing former president Alberto Fujimori to face his legal charges. The success of this venture will be contingent on the interplay of international law, human rights discourses, and the diplomatic politics between Peru and Japan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Movie plot: In December 2002, Mikael Blomkvist, publisher of Millennium magazine, loses a libel case involving allegations he published about billionaire financier Hans-Erik WennerstrÃ¶m. He is sentenced to three months in prison and a hefty fine. Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but damaged surveillance agent and hacker, is hired by Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of the wealthy Vanger family, to investigate Blomkvist. Vanger then hires Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, who vanished on Children's Day in 1966. Vanger believes that Harriet was murdered by a family member. Salander, who was ruled mentally incompetent as a child, is appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, after her previous guardian suffers a stroke. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, forces Salander to perform fellatio on him in return for the money she needs to buy a new computer; he withholds the full amount she has requested. At her next meeting with Bjurman, he beats and rapes her. Having used a hidden camera to record Bjurman raping her, Salander returns to take her revenge, torturing and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control of her life and finances. She then uses a tattoo gun to brand Bjurman's abdomen with the message \\"I am a sadist pig and a rapist\\". Blomkvist moves to a cottage on the Vanger estate and meets the Vanger family, including Harriet's brother Martin and cousin Cecilia. Inside Harriet's diary, he finds a list of five names alongside what might appear to be phone numbers. He visits retired police inspector Morell, who informs him that his investigation team had been unable to decipher them.

Q:Information:  - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude.  - Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound.  - Etiology (alternatively aetiology or ætiology) is the study of causation, or origination. The word is derived from the Greek , \\"aitiologia\\", \\"giving a reason for\\" (\\"aitia\\", \\"cause\\"; and , \\"-logia\\"). The word is most commonly used in medical and philosophical theories, where it is used to refer to the study of why things occur, or even the reasons behind the way that things act, and is used in philosophy, physics, psychology, government, geography, spatial analysis, medicine, theology, and biology in reference to the causes of various phenomena.  - Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation. It has also been called \\"early ejaculation,\\" \\"rapid ejaculation,\\" \\"rapid climax,\\" \\"premature climax,\\" and (historically) \\"ejaculatio praecox.\\" There is no uniform cut-off defining \\"premature\\", but a consensus of experts at the International Society for Sexual Medicine endorsed a definition including \\"ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute\\". The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) applies a cut-off of 15 seconds from the beginning of sexual intercourse.  - \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\" is a famous phrase typically featured on the American sketch comedy show \\"Saturday Night Live\\", which runs on the NBC broadcast network. It is generally used as a way to end a cold opening sketch and lead into the opening titles/montage and cast introductions for the program.  - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic.  - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show.  - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts.  - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014).  - The Ladies Man is a 2000 American comedy film that stars actor , comedian and former Saturday Night Live cast member Tim Meadows . It was directed by Reginald Hudlin . The movie focuses on the exploits of radio host and sex therapy expert Leon Phelps .  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - Sex therapy is a strategy for the treatment of sexual dysfunction when there is no medical etiology (physiological reason) or as a complement to medical treatment. The sexual dysfunctions which may be addressed by sex therapy include non-consummation, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, low libido, unwanted sexual fetishes, sexual addiction, painful sex, or a lack of sexual confidence, assisting people who are recovering from sexual assault, problems commonly caused by stress, tiredness, and other environmental and relationship factors. Sex therapists assist those experiencing problems in overcoming them, in doing so possibly regaining an active sex life.  - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what changes from gas in the air to liquid by reducing heat energy?\\" is \\"coffee\\", given that  water changes from gas in the air to liquid by reducing heat energy? Options are: *Yes. *No. Answer:","output":"No. Based on the information provided and the context of the question, the answer should not be \\"coffee.\\" The question asks about a substance that changes from gas in the air to liquid by reducing heat energy. The given fact states that water is a substance that undergoes this transformation. Therefore, the appropriate answer should be a substance that behaves similarly. Water is composed of H2O molecules, and its phase transitions (solid, liquid, and gas) are determined by changes in temperature and pressure. When heat energy is reduced, water molecules slow down and condense, transforming from gas (water vapor) to liquid (water). This process is known as condensation. While coffee does contain water, it is a mixture of various compounds and not a pure substance. As a beverage, coffee is mostly composed of water, but it also contains other ingredients such as caffeine, acids, oils, and flavor compounds derived from coffee beans. Hence, it would be inaccurate to identify coffee as the substance that undergoes the described change in the question. Additionally, coffee is typically thought of as a liquid and not as a gas. It is true that coffee can produce steam (water vapor) when it is hot, but this is a result of the water content in the coffee rather than the coffee itself. In conclusion, the answer should not be \\"coffee.\\" Instead, water is the correct answer, as it is the substance that changes from gas in the air to liquid by reducing heat energy."},{"instruction":"Process:  - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   suppose lots of rainy weather happens, how will it affect more animals die from smoke inhalation.

(May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On holiday in Egypt with George and Emily Hacker (Christopher Connelly and Martha Taylor), her archaeologist father and journalist mother, ten-year-old Susie Hacker (Brigitta Boccoli) is approached by a mysterious blind woman who gives her an amulet. Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find.

You asked her to marry you in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I LOVED her. Does it follow that \\"I loved her but that didn't stop you from asking her to marry you.\\"?","output":"While it is evident that you loved her deeply and passionately, it does not necessarily follow that \\"I loved her but that didn't stop you from asking her to marry you.\\" The situation and intentions of both individuals involved in this love triangle must be considered and analyzed in-depth. Let's break down the factors that may influence the decisions and actions of the parties involved. 1. Emotional connection: Love is a complex emotion that can manifest in various forms within different relationships. It is possible that the person asking her to marry him also loved her or had a significant emotional connection with her. Alternatively, they might not have shared the same level of emotional intimacy as you did. 2. Intentions: The reasons for asking her to marry him could differ considerably from the emotions driving your love for her. For instance, the proposal could be fueled by factors such as financial stability, social status, family expectations, or even a desire for companionship. In some cases, individuals might not even acknowledge or realize the depth of their feelings in the situation, leading to a proposal based purely on logical reasons. 3. Relationship dynamics: The nature of the relationships in this love triangle is another crucial element to consider. Were you and her close friends or secret lovers? Were there any obstacles that prevented you from being together, such as long-distance, cultural differences, or social barriers? On the other hand, did the person who asked her to marry him have a long-standing relationship with her? Was their connection based on trust, understanding, and a shared history that made the proposal feel like a natural progression in their partnership? 4. Communication: Effective communication is key to understanding and navigating emotional situations. Did you express your feelings and intentions to her or the person asking her to marry him? If your love was a secret or not fully acknowledged by all parties involved, this could have significantly impacted the resulting actions. The person proposing might be unaware of your feelings for her or the intensity of your relationship, thereby making the assumption that they were not encroaching on another person's emotional territory. 5. Timing: The timing of the proposal and your expression of love can also play a critical role in determining whether both actions can coexist. If you waited too long to convey your feelings or hesitated to take the leap of proposing to her, this delay could have opened the opportunity for someone else to take the initiative. Conversely, if the person asking her to marry him was aware of your feelings and chose to propose regardless, this could signal a disregard for your heartfelt emotions. In conclusion, while your love for her might have been genuine and intense, it does not necessarily imply that it precluded the person from asking her to marry him. Several factors such as emotional connection, intentions, relationship dynamics, communication, and timing, can influence individual decisions and actions in such intricate situations. It is essential to reflect on these aspects to fully comprehend the choices made by all parties in this love triangle, and understand the ways in which your love for her and the marriage proposal may or may not have been mutually exclusive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brexit minister Michael Russell said it would include plans to retain a place for Scotland in the single market and new devolved powers for Holyrood. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is \\"willing to listen to options\\", but Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested a special deal is \\"not realistic\\". The Scottish government has been studying its options around Brexit, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon setting up a \\"standing council\\" of experts for advice. Ms Sturgeon has outlined five key interests for Scotland in the process, including access to the European single market, protection for workers' rights, a say in shaping rules and the need to \\"make sure Scotland's voice is heard\\". In June's EU referendum, 62% of those who turned out in Scotland backed remain, to 38% for leave. Mike Russell said the paper would target a \\"substantial transfer of new powers to Holyrood\\", reflecting the fact that Brexit will see powers come back to the UK from Brussels. He also cautioned against any attempts to use Brexit as cover for a \\"Westminster power grab\\". He said the SNP government's ideal position would be for Scotland to be an independent EU member state, but said it had committed to putting forward \\"compromise proposals\\" to \\"mitigate the Brexit damage\\". Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond said concerns about the impact of Brexit and future access to the single market could prove decisive in any future referendum on independence. He said: \\"Nicola Sturgeon has said, I think quite correctly, we want the UK to stay in the single market place with the other protections. \\"If that's not possible we're publishing a strategy which shows how Scotland could do that. And if the UK government says 'oh, we're not interested in what Scotland has to say' - if they have a Philip Hammond-type of attitude as opposed to Theresa May's initial words on this, then of course we'd be in a different context, and I think a strong position to have that independence campaign.\\" He also set out what issues were important to the first minister in the context of Brexit. He said: \\"Nicola Sturgeon has put forward her priorities - staying in the single market, proper and equal treatment for other Europeans and the rights of Scottish workers - the protections which are currently bestowed by European law legislation. \\"I'm sure in the strategy document that's to be published this week, she'll be outlining a range of other things that Scotland requires, particularly the powers that we will need to secure Scotland's position. \\"Of course there are certain powers, for example fishing, agriculture, but also some control of immigration, that would be required within the single market place for Scotland to operate within it, as well as the full powers of Scottish independence.\\" It is expected that the proposals will also be announced to MSPs at Holyrood. The UK government has repeatedly pledged to listen to options and engage with the devolved administrations, but has warned their leaders not to \\"undermine the UK's position\\". After Chancellor Philip Hammond visited Edinburgh earlier in December, the Scottish government insisted that he indicated he \\"looked forward to hearing our proposals\\" and said they would be \\"considered fully\\". However, Mr Hammond himself appeared to rule out a special Brexit deal for Scotland, saying it was \\"not realistic\\". He told reporters that it was \\"clear that we can't have a different deal or different outcomes for different parts of the UK\\", and added that it would be a \\"disadvantage\\" for Scotland to be outside whatever new relationship the UK negotiates with the EU. This echoed earlier comments from Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who told MSPs that while Scotland's concerns would be \\"right at the heart of the process\\", there would be no \\"special deal\\". Mr Hammond said he wanted to work closely with the Scottish government and the other devolved administrations in order to \\"secure the best possible deal\\" for all parts of the UK, and also called for \\"sensible discussions\\" over what new powers are devolved to Holyrood post-Brexit. Ahead of the publication of the latest Scottish government's EU proposals, Mr Mundell said: \\"We'll consider the Scottish government's proposals carefully. \\"I hope to see plans that are credible and backed up by evidence. I also hope they commit to working closely with us - a Team UK approach - to get the best possible deal. \\"That is how we will get the right deal for the whole of the UK - and the right deal for the UK will be the right deal for Scotland\\". Scottish Labour's Europe spokesman Lewis Macdonald said his party had been calling for full transparency from the SNP for months. He added: \\"We want a close relationship with Europe, which should mean access to the single market. But it important to realise that access is different to membership. \\"Britain is leaving the EU, and it is very hard to see any way in which Scotland could remain in both the United Kingdom and the single European market. Expert after expert has said as much since summer. \\"Scottish Labour will categorically reject any proposal that would put our place in the UK at risk, or could lead to a hard border with England.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie MSP said his party would examine the SNP's plans when they were published. He added: \\"Unlike all the others, Liberal Democrats want Scotland to remain in the UK and the UK to remain in the EU. \\"The best route to remain in Europe is through a Brexit deal referendum. People should be given a say on the detail of the Brexit deal rather than hand the prime minister a blank cheque to agree anything she likes no matter the consequences. \\"If the SNP are so much in favour of the EU they should join us in that campaign.\\" The Scottish Greens said the government's plans needed to be comprehensive and feature key areas of policy. The party's external affairs spokesman Ross Greer said: \\"The Scottish government has been robust in defending our interests so far. \\"Nevertheless, the much anticipated options paper must include certain guarantees if the government wants the support of Green MSPs. \\"It must have a focus on free movement, workers' rights and environmental protections. And it must make the case for Scottish - or continued UK- membership of the Single Market.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"A paper detailing Scotland's plans to stay in the single market and receive new devolved powers will be published on Tuesday, Brexit minister Michael Russell has said.

Understand the task requirements: You need to find the product of all even numbers within each inner list and create an output list with the same length as the number of inner lists in the input list. 2. Make sure to handle cases where there are no even numbers in an inner list. In such cases, the output for that list should be 0. Here's how to approach this task step by step: 1. Create an empty list called 'output' to store the final results. 2. Iterate through each inner list in the input list:   a. Initialize a variable called 'product' and set it to 1 initially. This variable will store the product of the even numbers.   b. Iterate through each number in the inner list. Check if the number is even (number % 2 == 0).      i. If the number is even, multiply it by the 'product' variable.   c. Once the inner-loop is finished, check if the 'product' variable is still 1 (meaning no even numbers were found in the inner list). In that case, set the 'product' variable to 0, as the task specifies.   d. Append the 'product' to the 'output' list. 3. After iterating through all the inner lists, return the 'output' list which now contains the product of even numbers of each inner list or 0 if there were no even numbers.

Logic test: Jake heard a lion roaring in the distance and as he got closer to the lion the roar got (A) quieter (B) louder The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the logic step-by-step: 1. The initial scenario is that Jake heard a lion roaring in the distance. 2. As he got closer to the lion, the roar got either (A) quieter or (B) louder. Now, we need to use our understanding of how sounds work to determine the correct answer. 3. When a person gets closer to a sound source, the sound generally gets louder because the distance the sound waves have to travel is decreased, and there is less opportunity for the sound to be absorbed or dissipated by the surrounding environment. 4. Based on this understanding, as Jake got closer to the lion, the roar would have gotten louder, not quieter. 5. Therefore, the answer to the logic test is (B) louder. Now let's consider the options given for the answer: \\"Lion Roar Near\\" and \\"Lion Roar Far\\". \\"Lion Roar Near\\" implies that the lion's roar would be louder as the distance between Jake and the lion decreases, which aligns with our answer determined through logic.

Article: Revenge porn: Facebook teaming up with Government to stop nude photos ending up on Messenger, Instagram      Updated      If you've had a nude photo taken, you might be nervous about where it could end up.      Key points: Facebook working with e-Safety Commissioner to block image sharing      You could flag photos of you don't want circulated, then they cannot be uploaded again      Images sent to database won't be stored      Your phone may be hacked or a relationship turn sour, meaning the \\"revenge porn\\" picture could be made public without your say so.      Now, Facebook is partnering with a small Australian Government agency to prevent sexual or intimate images being shared without the subject's consent.      e-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said victims of \\"image-based abuse\\" would be able to take action before photos were posted to Facebook, Instagram or Messenger.      \\"We see many scenarios where maybe photos or videos were taken consensually at one point, but there was not any sort of consent to send the images or videos more broadly,\\" Ms Inman Grant said.      One in five Australian women aged 18-45 and one in four Indigenous Australians are victims of that abuse, she said.      How will it work?      If you're worried your intimate photos will end up on Instagram or Facebook, you can get in contact with the e-Safety Commissioner. They might then tell you to send the images to yourself on Messenger.      Yep, you heard that right. Send your own nudes … to yourself.      \\"It would be like sending yourself your image in email, but obviously this is a much safer, secure end-to-end way of sending the image without sending it through the ether,\\" Ms Inman Grant said.      Once the image is sent via Messenger, Ms Inman Grant said Facebook would use technology to \\"hash\\" it, which means creating a digital fingerprint or link.      \\"They're not storing the image, they're storing the link and using artificial intelligence and other photo-matching technologies,\\" she said.      \\"So if somebody tried to upload that same image, which would have the same digital footprint or hash value, it will be prevented from being uploaded.\\"      If the program goes according to plan, the photo will never show up on Facebook, even if a hacker or your ex tries to upload it.      Facebook's head of global safety, Antigone Davis, said Australia was one of four countries taking part in the \\"industry-first\\" pilot which uses \\"cutting-edge technology\\" to prevent the re-sharing on images on its platforms.      \\"The safety and wellbeing of the Facebook community is our top priority,\\" Ms Davis said.      Richmond medal photo recent example      Ms Inman Grant said image-based abuse could be an \\"incredibly devastating experience\\" for victims.      \\"A very recent example is of course what happened with the Richmond Football Club and the image of the young girl with the sports memorabilia on her bare chest. She had asked the player to delete it, he said he did, instead it was sent to a few mates and ended up on the internet,\\" she said.      Richmond's Nathan Broad was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 AFL season, after the photo went viral.      The e-Safety Commissioner said safeguards would ensure the photos would be secure inside Facebook.      \\"They thought of many different ways about doing this and they came to the conclusion as one of the major technology companies in the world that this was the safest way for users to share the digital footprints,\\" Ms Inman Grant said.      \\"We have a great deal of comfort that they have chose the most secure route … we want to empower people to be able to protect themselves and take action, we don't want to make them vulnerable.\\"      Topics: government-and-politics, federal-parliament, federal---state-issues, sexual-offences, people, social-policy, computers-and-technology, internet-technology, australia      First posted ||||| Facebook is testing a new preemptive revenge porn defense in Australia that may, at first blush, feel counterproductive: uploading your nude photos or videos directly to Messenger. According to the Australia Broadcasting Corporation, Facebook has partnered with the office of the Australian government’s e-Safety Commissioner, which works primarily to prevent the online abuse of minors, to develop the new system for combating the nonconsensual sharing of explicit media.      By uploading the images or videos you fear may be shared in the future in an attempt to shame or harass you online, Facebook can digitally “hash” the media, effectively giving it a digital footprint. This allows the social network to track the media using the same artificial intelligence-based technologies it uses in its photo and face matching algorithms, and then prevent it from being uploaded and shared in the future. This works only if you’re in possession of the original file, but it would seem to bypass any attempts from a malicious third party to alter the metadata by analyzing and tagging the actual content of the image or video.      Facebook can digitally tag uploading photos or videos to prevent future uploading      Facebook first implemented a similar, although less preemptive, mechanism for preventing the proliferation of revenge porn back in April, with the implementation of a photo-matching system to prevent the spread of images that have already been reported and taken down. The company has also liberally banned accounts for revenge porn activities. But now Facebook seems to be asking users to think ahead and play it safe if they feel particularly vulnerable, which could be the case in a relationship that becomes abusive over time or only after it’s ended.      \\"We see many scenarios where maybe photos or videos were taken consensually at one point, but there was not any sort of consent to send the images or videos more broadly,\\" e-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant told ABC. “They're not storing the image. They're storing the link and using artificial intelligence and other photo-matching technologies. So if somebody tried to upload that same image, which would have the same digital footprint or hash value, it will be prevented from being uploaded.”      Of course, there are a few concerns here worth mentioning. Although Facebook is using a hashing system to avoid storing the photos or videos directly on its servers, that the company has a bad reputation with regards to privacy and consumer trust means everyday users might think uploading directly to Messenger is the equivalent of posting revenge porn against themselves. And because it’s just a test right now, there’s no telling whether the system can be easily tricked by altering aspects of the photo, sometimes in subtle and even imperceptible ways, to trick Facebook’s filters.      Successful attempts at tricking machine vision systems are well documented. Hackers and researchers alike have been known to use what are called “adversarial images” that use digital manipulations to trick AI algorithms, either by making a facial recognition system think someone looks like someone else, or by forcing a piece of image recognition software to think it’s looking at an one object that is in reality just a noisy mess of geometric shapes. It’s not farfetched to think Facebook’s automatic revenge porn filtering system could be bypassed in similar ways, by inserting enough hidden data in between the lines of an image to make it seem different enough from the source to the eyes of an algorithm.      Update at 5:02PM ET, 11/7: Clarified that Facebook’s hashing system means it can recognize files without needing explicit access to them on its servers. ||||| By Antigone Davis, Head of Global Safety      Today, we are announcing new tools to help people when intimate images are shared on Facebook without their permission. When this content, often referred to as “revenge porn,” is reported to us, we can now prevent it from being shared on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. This is part of our ongoing effort to help build a safe community on and off Facebook.      According to a study of US victims of non-consensual intimate images, 93% report significant emotional distress and 82% report significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of their life.      We’ve designed our tools to help people in these situations. Here’s how it works:      If you see an intimate image on Facebook that looks like it was shared without permission, you can report it by using the “Report” link that appears when you tap on the downward arrow or “…” next to a post.      Specially trained representatives from our Community Operations team review the image and remove it if it violates our Community Standards. In most cases, we will also disable the account for sharing intimate images without permission. We offer an appeals process if someone believes an image was taken down in error.      We then use photo-matching technologies to help thwart further attempts to share the image on Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. If someone tries to share the image after it’s been reported and removed, we will alert them that it violates our policies and that we have stopped their attempt to share it.      We also partner with safety organizations to offer resources and support to the victims of this behavior.      These tools, developed in partnership with safety experts, are one example of the potential technology has to help keep people safe. Facebook is in a unique position to prevent harm, one of our five areas of focus as we help build a global community.      We are grateful for all of the advice and assistance we received in developing these tools and resources. We worked with the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and other companies to create a one-stop destination for victims and others to report this content to the major technology companies. We also launched a guide specific to Facebook. Additionally, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Center for Social Research, the Revenge Porn Helpline (UK) and the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative provided input and feedback throughout the product-development process.      We convened over 150 safety organizations and experts last year in Kenya, India, Ireland, Washington DC, New York, Spain, Turkey, Sweden and the Netherlands to get feedback on ways we can improve. Their feedback helped drive us to today’s announcement.      We look forward to building on these tools and working with other companies to explore how they could be used across the industry.

Individuals who have shared intimate, nude or sexual images with partners and are worried that the partner (or ex-partner) might distribute them without their consent can use Messenger to send the images to be “hashed”. This means that the company converts the image into a unique digital fingerprint that can be used to identify and block any attempts to re-upload that same image.      Facebook is piloting the technology in Australia in partnership with a government agency headed up by the e-safety commissioner, Julia Inman Grant, who told ABC it would allow victims of “image-based abuse” to take action before pictures were posted to Facebook, Instagram or Messenger.      “We see many scenarios where maybe photos or videos were taken consensually at one point, but there was not any sort of consent to send the images or videos more broadly,” she told the Australian broadcaster.      Carrie Goldberg, a New York-based lawyer who specializes in sexual privacy, said: “We are delighted that Facebook is helping solve this problem – one faced not only by victims of actual revenge porn but also individuals with worries of imminently becoming victims.      “With its billions of users, Facebook is one place where many offenders aggress because they can maximize the harm by broadcasting the nonconsensual porn to those most close to the victim. So this is impactful.”      In the Australian pilot, users must first complete an online form on the e-safety commissioner’s website outlining their concerns. They will then be asked to send the pictures they are concerned about to themselves on Messenger while the e-safety commissioner’s office notifies Facebook of their submission. Once Facebook gets that notification, a community operations analyst will access the image and hash it to prevent future instances from being uploaded or shared.      Facebook will store these images for a short period of time before deleting them to ensure it is enforcing the policy correctly, the company said.      Roughly 4% of US internet users have been victims of revenge porn, according to a 2016 report from the Data & Society Research Institute. The proportion rises to 10% when dealing with women under the age of 30.      This builds on existing tools Facebook has to deal with revenge porn. In April the social networking site released reporting tools to allow users to flag intimate photos posted without their consent to “specially trained representatives” from the site’s community operations team who “review the image and remove it if it violates [Facebook’s] community standards”. Once a picture has been removed, photo-matching technology is used to ensure the image isn’t uploaded again.      Facebook and other technology companies use this type of photo-matching technology where images are “hashed” to tackle other types of content including child sex abuse and extremist imagery.      The technology was first developed in 2009 by Microsoft, working closely with Dartmouth and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to clamp down on the same images of sexually abused children being circulated over and over again on the internet. There was technology that could find exact matches of images, but abusers could get around this by slightly altering the files – either by changing their size or adding a small mark.      PhotoDNA’s “hash” matching technology made it possible to identify known illegal images even if someone had altered them. Facebook, Twitter and Google all use the same hash database to identify and remove illegal images.      Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth who helped develop PhotoDNA, described Facebook’s pilot as a “terrific idea”.      “The deployment of this technology would not prevent someone from sharing images outside of the Facebook ecosystem, so we should encourage all online platforms to participate in this program, as we do with PhotoDNA,” he said.      A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was exploring additional partners and countries.

Both lived, and went on to even stranger misadventures than before.We flashback to scenes from Frankenstein (1931), which lead up to our new story. After the mill collapses, and it seems the Monster has been destroyed, the burgomeister (E.E. Clive) urges everyone to return to their homes. But the father (Reginald Barlow) of the little girl whom the Monster had killed (accidentally) in the first film, wants to see the creature's dead body with his own eyes before he can have peace. His wife (Mary Gordon) tries to stop him; but when the man wanders through the still-burning debris, he falls through a hole that leads to a flooded cavern below the mill. The Monster rises out of the water and kills the poor man, later doing the same for his wife. The Frankensteins' hysterical servant Minnie (Una O'Connor) also meets with the Monster, but manages to escape with her life. But no one believes her when she screeches that the Monster is still on the loose.Henry wants nothing more than to settle into a peaceful life with his new bride (Valerie Hobson).

Four Arrested in Moberly Drug Operation MOBERLY - Officers found marijuana, meth paraphernalia, money and other items used to distribute and use narcotics in Moberly on Tuesday. Two men and two women were taken into custody where they are awaiting formal charges. Three juveniles were removed from the house and placed with a family member. The Officers with the North Missouri Drug Task Force, the Randolph County Sheriff's Department and the Moberly Police Department executed the search warrant at 716 North Ault Street in Moberly. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Moberly does not have a drug crime problem.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclusively determine that \\"Moberly does not have a drug crime problem.\\" The paragraph reports a single incident in which officers carried out a drug operation at a specific address in Moberly, resulting in the arrest of four people and seizure of drugs, money, and paraphernalia. However, this one incident cannot be used to generalize the entire city's situation with drug crime. To provide a comprehensive analysis of Moberly's drug crime problem, we would need to consider various factors including long-term trends in drug-related arrests, the prevalence of drug usage within the community, drug-related deaths or overdoses, and existing efforts to combat drug-related issues. Additionally, comparing Moberly's drug crime statistics with surrounding areas or similar-sized cities could offer a better understanding of the extent of the problem. In conclusion, while the paragraph indicates that a drug operation occurred and resulted in arrests and seizures in Moberly, this single event does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement about the city's overall drug crime problem.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device Beneath the gloss provided by Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and N'Golo Kante, there is an unheralded efficiency to this Chelsea side. BBC Sport takes a look at the players who have had a quiet impact on a title-winning season, and the unexpected areas that have sealed the championship for the Blues. All statistics are correct as of 22:00 BST on 12 May, with Chelsea having played 36 games. Once you have taken a look, consider how many of this current crop of Chelsea players would make it into the squad that won the club's first Premier League title in 2004-05. Use our team selector below to find out. Pick your best XI from Chelsea's Premier League winners in 2004-05 and 2016-17. Cesar Azpilicueta has proven his adaptability this season, moving from right-back to a position in a central-defensive three. One thing has not changed though - his reliability. The Spain defender is one of only three outfield players to have featured in every minute of every Premier League game this season - clocking up 3,240 minutes. His defensive colleague Gary Cahill has only missed six minutes of action, giving boss Antonio Conte a dependable duo at the back. When it comes to minutes played, Cesc Fabregas is way, way down the pecking order. The former Arsenal midfielder, who has said he could have left Stamford Bridge in the summer, has started only 12 league games this term, but his impact has been substantial. Only three players have provided more than his 11 assists in the top-flight campaign - Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne leads the way with 15, while Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea) and Christian Eriksen (Spurs) have 12. That trio have played much more football than Fabregas, so it is no surprise that the averages show the Spaniard far outshines his rivals, with an assist every 111 minutes he has been on the pitch. And having seen his reaction when he was told he might lose one of his assists - which Opta later gave him back - we think he'll be pretty pleased. You know where you stand with Gary Cahill - block it, head it, get rid of it. Right? Wrong. The England centre-half fancies himself as a bit of a ball player, it seems. Of all the Premier League defenders to have played at least 20 games this term, only Manchester City's John Stones has a better passing accuracy. Not only has Cahill been composed in front of his own goal, he has been deadly at the other end too. The same can be said for Marcos Alonso who, until joining Chelsea in the summer, was best known in England for spells with Bolton and Sunderland. The pair have six goals each this season - the only defender with more is Liverpool's James Milner, and all seven of his were from the penalty spot. So while Costa has been grabbing the headlines for being on target 20 times, maybe his defensive team-mates deserve a bit of recognition. Though Alonso has scored those six goals, it is the wing-back on the opposite flank who has been the more adventurous this season. No Chelsea player has seen their career revitalised so sharply under Conte than Victor Moses. The Nigeria international, previously recognised as a forward in four unspectacular years at Stamford Bridge, has flourished as a right wing-back. The 26-year-old has had 99 touches in the opposition area this season, more than any other Blues defender. In fact, the only defender to have had more touches in the opposition box this term is Michail Antonio (122), who plays in a similar role for West Ham. The old adage of not scoring if you do not shoot has been very apt for Chelsea this season. Their tally of 12 goals scored from outside the box is a league high, with Liverpool closest on 11. And Spain international Pedro, who leads the way for the Blues, has found the net three times from long distance. Costa, Fabregas and Alonso have each pitched in with two. It must be tough playing alongside the best defensive midfielder in the world. Kante is considered the king of Hoovering up, the emperor of the track back and the don of mid-pitch duels. Nemanja Matic gives his partner-in-midfield-hustling a run for his money, though, particularly when it comes to discipline. Matic has been shown yellow cards to Kante's nine, and given away 33 free-kicks to 52. And when it comes to recoveries [the number of times a player has picked up a loose ball], he is only 22 behind Kante's tally of 263. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article focuses on the unheralded efficiency of the Chelsea football team and highlights the contributions of various players during their title-winning season. Cesar Azpilicueta demonstrated his adaptability, becoming a key figure in the defensive lineup, featuring in every minute of every Premier League game that season. Gary Cahill boasted exceptional passing accuracy and contributed six goals. Victor Moses revitalized his career under manager Antonio Conte, with 99 touches in the opposition area. Chelsea's notable outside-the-box goal-scoring ability led the league with 12 goals, with Pedro contributing three. Nemanja Matic showcased discipline and impressive recovery and loose ball handling that rivaled N'Golo Kante's performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","output":"c). are talking to the camera about the instrument. Explanation: The original sentence describes a scene where a man and a woman are using a plastic instrument to put on their socks. Since the plastic instrument was mentioned in the sentence, it's most likely that the continuation of the scene would involve people talking about the instrument (option c).  Option a is irrelevant as it mentions putting a tile and running in the street, which is unrelated to the scene described. Option b involves doing shoes and making some unclear actions with a nail clipper, which also doesn't fit the situation. Option d mentions playing drums and blowing the air, which is not related to the use of a plastic instrument for putting on socks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: How could I turn down an opportunity for a weeklong cruise on a luxury motorsailer in the Andaman Sea? Without a second thought, I packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Singapore, and the following day I found myself looking out the airplane window at the beautiful waters surrounding the island of Langkawi off the coast of Malaysia. The last time I was in Langkawi was in 2001, when it was relatively quiet. Langkawi has come a long way since then; there are 4, 5, and even 6-star hotels, as well as spas, golfing, horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island. At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty-free goodies. Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty-free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island. A luxurious yacht tender picked us up. Phillipe, the first mate, maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was, S/V Blue Gold. This majestic 10-passenger sailboat--all 165 feet of her--had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit. Once aboard, the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles. Before we got too comfortable and settled into the plush comforts of the boat, Alain, the captain, took us on a tour of Blue Gold's impressive accommodations. The master suite had a king-size bed, with a lounge area and \\"his & hers\\" wardrobes. The VIP cabin had a queen-size bed, also with a lounge area. Both had ensuite bathrooms. The first evening aboard was the perfect start to our voyage--a small cocktail party followed by a light meal of seared tuna salad. It was exactly what our jet-lagged bodies craved, and we all slept very well aboard what would become our new home for the next 7 days. In the morning after breakfast, we sailed to Pulau Ta Ngah (also spelled \\"Pulau Tengah\\"; pulau means island in Malay). In the 1970s the site had been a Vietnamese refugee transit camp. Not...

Here are two sentences: A DOD team is working to determine how hackers gained access to the system and what needs to be done to fix the breach . A DoD team is on site to determine how this happened and what needs to be done to fix the breach , the release stated . Do they have the same meaning? Options:  (1). no  (2). yes","output":"(2). yes Both of these sentences convey the same meaning, although they are worded differently. Let's break down each sentence to understand their meanings effectively. 1. A DOD team is working to determine how hackers gained access to the system and what needs to be done to fix the breach. 2. A DoD team is on site to determine how this happened and what needs to be done to fix the breach, the release stated. Looking at these sentences, we can see that they both involve a DoD (Department of Defense) team. Both sentences mention that the team is focused on two primary tasks: determining how the breach or unauthorized access happened, and figuring out what must be done to fix the issue. In sentence 1, the cause of the breach is mentioned explicitly as \\"hackers gaining access to the system.\\" In sentence 2, it refers to the same cause by saying \\"how this happened,\\" without specifying hackers. However, the context and meaning are still the same, as both sentences mention a breach that needs to be fixed. The only difference in information between these two sentences is that sentence 2 adds that the DoD team is on site to accomplish these tasks, while sentence 1 does not explicitly mention their location. However, this is implicit in the context. Moreover, the second sentence also cites a \\"release\\" as the source of this information. In summary, these sentences primarily convey the same overall meaning, even though they are phrased differently. The minor difference in location and source information does not change the essence, which is that a DoD team is engaged in addressing and rectifying a security breach. Thus, the answer is (2). yes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"did this to be friendly\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" in the context of Bailey playing baseball with a friend for the last time today, the answer \\"did this to be friendly\\" may not be entirely appropriate. This is because the question is about what the other person wants to do next, while the answer provided suggests a rationale for their previous action. Additionally, it is important to understand that the question is looking for a more detailed response to forecast the other person's future actions or desires. I will provide a more comprehensive answer below. To develop a more valid answer, we must first consider a few factors, such as the specific reasons behind this being the \\"last time\\" for Bailey and his friend to play baseball, their shared interests, the nature of their relationship, and the emotions involved. Additionally, recognizing the context of the question and understanding the situation can help us determine the possible actions taken by Others. For example, if the reason behind this being the last time they played baseball is due to a geographical constraint—such as one of them moving away or relocating—the answer could be something along the lines of: \\"While Others may have played baseball as a friendly activity with Bailey today, given that this is the last time they will be doing so, their next actions might involve maintaining their friendship through long-distance communication means such as phone calls, video chats, and online messaging. They may also choose to visit each other occasionally or plan trips together to keep the bond they share alive.\\" However, if it is the last time they play baseball due to an injury or a change in either of their interests, the answer could evolve accordingly: \\"If Others are choosing not to play baseball anymore due to an injury, they may look for alternative hobbies or activities to maintain their connection with Bailey. This could involve exploring a new sport, joining interest clubs, or participating in non-sports-related activities such as art or music. The focus for Others would be on seeking out new opportunities or experiences that match their changing interests or physical capabilities.\\" Overall, the response to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" should ideally revolve around assessing factors such as the reason behind the last baseball game, personal choices/preferences, and the dynamics of the friendship. The response should be specific, detailed, and relevant to the context, providing possible future actions for the friend to explore. \\"Did this to be friendly\\" does not adequately answer the question, as it is more focused on explaining the previous action rather than anticipating future desires or activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this fact: \\"An example of a chemical change is acid breaking down substances\\" Now answer this question: \\"Which would likely result in a chemical change?\\"","output":"A chemical change involves a process in which one or more substances are transformed into new substances with different chemical properties. The original substances lose their original properties, and new substances with distinct chemical structures and properties are formed. In the given fact, acid breaking down substances is an example of a chemical change, as the acid reacts with the substances and forms new products. Now, consider the following situations that would likely result in a chemical change: 1. Combustion: The process of burning a substance in the presence of oxygen is called combustion, which results in the formation of new compounds, such as carbon dioxide, water, and ash. For example, when you burn wood or fossil fuels like coal, gasoline, or natural gas, a chemical change occurs. 2. Electrolysis: The process of using electricity to cause a non-spontaneous chemical reaction is called electrolysis. It involves breaking down ionic compounds by passing an electric current through a solution containing the compound. For example, the electrolysis of water results in the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases, which are chemically different from the water molecules. 3. Rusting: The slow oxidation of a metal, such as iron or steel, in contact with atmospheric oxygen and moisture is called rusting or corrosion. The rust formed is a new substance called iron oxide, which has different chemical properties than the original metal. 4. Digestion: The process by which our body breaks down ingested food into simpler substances for absorption and utilization involves several chemical changes. Enzymes present in our digestive system break down complex carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller, absorbable nutrients like sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids. 5. Photosynthesis: The process by which green plants and certain other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose is called photosynthesis. Light absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in plant cells triggers a series of chemical reactions, which convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen gas. This process represents a chemical change, as new substances are formed with different properties. 6. Acid-Base Neutralization: The reaction between an acid and a base to produce a salt and water is called neutralization. For instance, hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacting with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O). The products formed are chemically different from the reactants. In conclusion, several situations can result in a chemical change, including combustion, electrolysis, rusting, digestion, photosynthesis, and acid-base neutralization. Each of these processes involves the formation of new substances with distinct chemical properties from the original reactants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Let Children Roam  Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \\"culture of fear\\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars.

When the act is assented to by the sovereign in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given at the moment when the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent. Royal Assent is considered not given at what moment? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Royal Assent is considered not given at the moment when the letters patent signifying the assent are merely signed or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house. Royal Assent is also not considered given if only one of the presiding officers has announced the assent to their respective house. It is only considered given when both presiding officers of the two houses have formally received the letters patent from the sovereign and have notified their respective houses of the grant of Royal Assent. Hence, even if the letters patent are signed and delivered to the presiding officers, the Royal Assent is not deemed granted unless both houses have been officially informed of the assent. If these conditions are not met, the act does not take effect under British law, as it is stipulated that an act comes into force on the date it receives the Royal Assent, and this date is deemed to be when both houses have been formally notified of the assent.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who held a position for 33 years?, using the article: Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune.  It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440.  Furthermore,  when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s.  The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages. In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily.  Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,..., what would be the answer ?

Background: Katherine Anne \\"Kitty\\" Pryde is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980) and was co-created by writer-artist John Byrne and Chris Claremont. A mutant, Pryde possesses a \\"phasing\\" ability that allows her, as well as objects or people she is in contact with, to become intangible. This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate levitation. Context: Kitty Pryde was introduced into the X-Men title as the result of an editorial dictate that the book was supposed to depict a school for mutants. Uncanny X-Men artist John Byrne named Kitty Pryde after a classmate he met in art school, Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary in 1973. He had told Pryde he liked her name and asked for permission to use it, promising to name his first original comics character after her. Byrne drew the character to slightly resemble an adolescent Sigourney Weaver.  The fictional Kitty Pryde first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980), by writer Chris Claremont and artist Byrne, as a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. Claremont said several elements of the character's personality were derived from those of X-Men editor Louise Simonson's daughter, Julie. Claremont and Byrne made the new character a full-fledged X-Man in issue #139, where she was codenamed \\"Sprite\\". She was the main character in issues #141-142, the \\"Days of Future Past\\" storyline, where she is possessed by her older self, whose consciousness time travels to the past to prevent a mass extermination of mutants. The six-issue miniseries Kitty Pryde and Wolverine (1984-1985), written by Claremont, is a coming-of-age storyline in which she matures from a girl to a young woman, adopting the new name \\"Shadowcat\\".  In the late '80s, she joined the British-based super team, Excalibur, where she remained for roughly ten years before coming back to the X-Men. In the early 2000s, she disappeared from the spotlight after semi-retiring from superhero work. She was featured in the 2002 mini-series Mekanix and came back to the main X-Men books in 2004 under the pen of Joss Whedon in Astonishing X-Men. She remained a part of the X-Men books until 2008 when she left again for roughly 2 years. After coming back, she was featured in Jason Aaron's Wolverine and the X-Men and Brian Michael Bendis' All-New X-Men books.  In early 2015, she joined the Guardians of the Galaxy. After the Secret Wars event, she adopted her new alias, Star-Lord (first believed to be Star-Lady).  Shadowcat's popularity had a profound effect on the real-life Kitty Pryde: the latter became so overwhelmed by attention from Shadowcat fans, she abbreviated her name to K.D. Pryde to avoid association with her fictional counterpart. She has since stated she has mixed feelings about her fame, saying she values Byrne's comics for their entertainment and artistic value, but wishes more people would appreciate her as more than just Shadowcat's namesake. Question: What is the story behind the name Kitty Pryde?

When Kitty Pryde, the fictional superhero, was created by Byrne and Chris Claremont and introduced in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980), they named the character after the real-life Kitty Pryde.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is used to move people?\\" is \\"air\\", given that  rafts are used for moving people? Answer:","output":"No, it would be incorrect to say that \\"air\\" is the right answer to the question, \\"what is used to move people?\\" with the explanation that rafts are used for moving people. The reasoning here needs some clarification. When we discuss 'moving people', it generally refers to methods of transportation that humans use to go from one place to another. The term 'raft' belongs to this context, as rafts are a kind of water transportation - a buoyant structure designed to carry people or goods over water bodies. Arguably, there could be several other possible answers as well - bicycles, cars, buses, trucks, trains, planes, and even walking, among others. These are all different means of transportation that directly move people from one place to another. On the contrary, \\"air\\" doesn't directly provide transportation in the same vein. Though you could make an argument that air is used for air travel, this would be a misrepresentation - the airplane, constructed and operated by humans, is what's essentially moving people, not the air itself. Though the air does play a crucial role in providing lift and facilitating flight, it cannot be considered a mode of transportation in itself. Yes, air travel is a crucial part of modern transportation, but it's primarily the aircraft, not the air, that's serving as the transport here. Additionally, if we try to draw a parallel between air and water (since rafts move on water), it's still not entirely accurate. Air, unlike water, can't buoy or support structures like a raft without specific engineering interventions - such as designing an airship or an aeroplane. However, water can naturally support many structures without requiring special design considerations. Rafts, boats, and a lot more types of vessels can float and move on water due to its properties. In conclusion, while air and rafts both play vital roles in the overall subject of transportation, they aren't equivalent when answering the question, \\"what is used to move people?\\" The answer would more aptly be \\"modes of transportation\\" such as cars, trains, planes, rafts, etc."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Francis last month took the helm of a Roman Catholic Church that has been rocked in recent years by allegations of priests sexually abusing minors. Francis recommended that the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith \\"act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse, first of all by promoting measures for the protection of minors, as well as in offering assistance to those who have suffered abuse, carrying out due proceedings against the guilty,\\" the Vatican said. The statement does not specify who \\"the guilty\\" are. But in recent years, priests, nuns and other people connected to the Catholic Church have been accused of sexually abusing children. Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward His instructions to move decisively, \\"continuing along the lines set by Benedict XVI,\\" came in an audience with Archbishop Gerhard Ludwig Muller, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith -- or the Vatican's main doctrinal enforcer. Benedict held that role before he became pope. Francis called for the Church hierarchy to \\"formulate and implement\\" the necessary directives to address an area he described as \\"so important\\" to the Church's credibility and worship. The pope said that the \\"victims of abuse are present in a particular way in his prayers for those who are suffering,\\" the Vatican said. It's the first time Francis has publicly addressed the issue since becoming pope. Opinion: Next pope must tackle sex abuse The U.S.-based group SNAP, or the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, reacted with skepticism to the news from the Vatican. Barbara Dorris, victims outreach director for SNAP, said there was a need for action rather than words. \\"Once again, as has happened hundreds of times already, a top Catholic official says he's asking another top Catholic official to take action about pedophile priests and complicit bishops,\\" she said in a statement. \\"Big deal.\\" The new pope should be ordering a change of track rather than a continuation on the same course, Dorris said. \\"It's tragic that Pope Francis is asking a top aide to stay on the irresponsible path charted by Pope Benedict,\\" she said. \\"It's tragic that a pope who's shown a willingness to send signals that hint at change in several ways is not signaling that he wants no change in how the church deals with child sex crimes and cover ups.\\" She called for concrete action to protect vulnerable children, \\"not old vague pledges that help a widely-discredited institution protect its reputation.\\" 5 things to know about the new pope Benedict XVI said many times that abusers should be prosecuted, but was accused by SNAP and other victims' groups of doing too little. He stepped down as pontiff at the end of February. Benedict spoke with some victims of sexual abuse by priests on papal visits to countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, where he expressed his \\"deep sorrow\\" over the scandal. The Vatican selected those whom he met. Members of SNAP in Illinois have asked Francis to meet with survivors of abuse by priests. Last month, one alleged victim of priest sex abuse in Los Angeles, Michael Duran, urged Francis to give Catholics new hope and make priests and cardinals accountable for their actions in cases where children have been sexually abused by clergy. Duran said he was sexually abused for three years by a Los Angeles Archdiocese priest beginning in 1983, when Duran was 11. The priest has since been defrocked and a lawsuit against him and the archdiocese has been settled. CNN's Livia Borghese reported from Rome. Richard Allen Greene reported and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.","output":"Title: Global Perspectives Emerge as Pope Francis Addresses Sexual Abuse in the Catholic Church In an unprecedented public statement, Pope Francis has urged senior Vatican officials to \\"act decisively\\" in cases of sexual abuse, promoting measures to protect minors and extending support to victims. The recent statement is the first time Pope Francis has addressed the issue since becoming pope and marks a significant shift in the Roman Catholic Church after numerous allegations involving priests sexually abusing minors.  The pope has directed the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to prioritize child protection alongside ensuring due proceedings against the guilty parties. Although the statement does not explicitly identify who \\"the guilty\\" are, in recent years, priests, nuns, and associated individuals have faced multiple accusations involving child abuse.  Catholics worldwide have shared their thoughts on how the church should move forward under Pope Francis's leadership, fostering a recognition that addressing the issue is crucial to maintaining the Church's credibility and worship. Pope Francis has called for the Church hierarchy to develop and enforce the necessary directives to confront an area he described as \\"so important.\\" While the pontiff's stance on the issue has gained support, the U.S.-based group SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests) remains skeptical about the Vatican's announcement. They argue that concrete actions should be prioritized to protect children rather than continuing on the established path of previous popes, such as Benedict XVI. Critics emphasize the need for tangible change in the church's handling of child sex crimes and accompanying cover-ups. As more global perspectives emerge in response to the pope's stand against sexual abuse, finding a balance between forgiveness and justice remains vital in maintaining the Church's integrity while ensuring the protection and support of victims."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Who should break weight loss down into long term goals? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B. The author.  C. The Mayo Clinic.  D. A dieter. Answer:","output":"D. A dieter.  Step 1: Understanding the question - The passage discusses the importance of breaking down weight loss into weekly goals rather than focusing only on the long-term goal. This helps in managing the weight-loss program better and keeping motivated.  Step 2: Identifying the options - Here, the options provided are related to who should use this method of breaking long-term goals into week-by-week targets.  Step 3: Evaluating the options in relation to the context of the passage - The passage is providing advice on how to stick to a diet and achieve weight loss goals. This advice is meant for people who are planning to lose weight- referred to as 'dieters'.   Step 4: Drawing a conclusion - Based on the passage, the one who should break weight loss into long-term goals would be the individual on a diet (D.

The phrase \\"personal tragedy\\" has a negative sentiment. The word \\"tragedy\\" evokes feelings of sadness, loss, and grief. As it is a personal tragedy, the emotional impact is likely to be even more pronounced, as it directly affects the individual on a deep, personal level. The phrase \\"the human comedy,\\" on the other hand, has a positive sentiment. It refers to the lighter, more humorous side of life and human behavior. This phrase likely brings about feelings of amusement, joy, and lightheartedness. So, when looking at the sentence as a whole, we can see that it contains both negative and positive sentiments: Negative sentiment: \\"personal tragedy\\" Positive sentiment: \\"the human comedy\\" The sentence seems to be trying to express the duality and complexity of human emotion and experience. While personal tragedies can bring about negative feelings, we are reminded that life also offers the warmth and laughter of the human comedy.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

David had trouble breathing after he ate the cookie, but his mother knew what to do and she quickly gave him medicine that helped him feel better almost right away. The body's reaction to certain foods can be quite severe, resulting in breathing problems, as in David's case, or loss of consciousness for some. There are many things we eat may cause our bodies to react badly if we have a food allergy . The most common food allergies seem to be related to milk, soy, eggs, wheat flour, peanuts, nuts, and seafood. In fact, these kinds of foods account for 90% of food allergies. According to some studies, the number of children who have a food allergy is growing. But some people now argue that test results might not actually be accurate, so food allergies are not really as common as they may appear. There are three typical ways that doctors test for food allergies. Probably the most accurate way is for a doctor to give a child a  food challenge\\", For this, the doctor watches the child eat small amounts of certain foods to see if the child has an allergic reaction or not. This method is very time consuming so it is used less often than the other two methods: skin tests and blood tests. In a skin test, a doctor puts very small amounts of the parts of the foods that the child may be allergic to under the child's skin, then watches to see if the child's skin reacts to the allergens . In a blood test, doctors take some of the child's blood and add possible allergens to it and then look for chemicals in the blood that indicate a possible allergic reaction. A problem with both the skin test and the blood test is that neither will show how severe an allergic reaction might be.

One in five Brits don't  realise make-up has a recommended use-by date.","output":"Title: The Hidden Dangers of Outdated Mascara: How Clued Up Are You on Makeup Expiration Dates? Introduction As we delve into the world of beauty products, it's no secret that mascara can hold a special place in our makeup bags. However, are we aware that, like other products, mascara has an expiration date? According to recent findings, 70% of British women are using mascara that is over a year old, while one in five Brits are unaware that makeup has a recommended use-by date. Let's delve deeper into the potential risks of using outdated mascara and ways to stay informed about makeup expiration dates. Why Does Mascara Have an Expiration Date? Step 1: Explain the need for expiration dates in beauty products Makeup products, including mascaras, contain preservatives that help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and mold. Over time, these preservatives lose their potency, leaving the product susceptible to contamination. In the case of mascara, the risk is heightened since the wand is frequently exposed to air, allowing for bacteria to enter and multiply. Typically, mascara has a shelf life of about three months once opened. The Risks of Using Outdated Mascara Step 2: Explain the dangers and health risks associated with using expired mascara Expired mascara not only loses its effectiveness in terms of performance, but it also poses a risk to your eye health. Using outdated mascara can lead to bacterial infections, such as conjunctivitis and styes, and even cause irritation, redness, and allergic reactions. In severe cases, using contaminated mascara can threaten your vision. To maintain healthy eyes and optimal mascara performance, it's crucial to replace the product regularly. Staying Informed About Makeup Expiration Dates Step 3: Highlight ways to determine and keep track of expiration dates While one in five Brits don't realize that makeup has a recommended use-by date, you can stay informed by following these tips: 1. Check the label: Many makeup products feature a small symbol, usually a jar with a number inside, that indicates the shelf life. For example, \\"6M\\" means the product will last six months after opening. 2. Mark the opening date: Using a permanent marker, write the opening date on the product's packaging. This will help you keep track of when it's time to replace it. 3. Use your senses: If your mascara starts to develop an unusual smell, texture, or color, it's likely time to toss it and buy a new one. 4. Stick to a routine: Make it a habit to replace your mascara every three months or whenever you notice a change in its consistency or performance. Conclusion In conclusion, being mindful of the expiration dates for makeup, particularly mascara, is crucial for maintaining a healthy beauty routine.

Please answer the following question: Q: Higher temperatures increase the rate of reaction in a lot of chemical reactions because they increase the frequency of what interaction between reactant particles?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: The woman said she might show up, but being as she was committed, what is the likelihood she would show up?  Choices:  - wont - unlikely - will - weakness - definitely  The rationale to choose \\"definitely\\" as the answer is that:","output":"The rationale to choose \\"definitely\\" as the answer can be broken down into several points that touch on various aspects such as commitment, human behavior, and the importance of context while interpreting the given information. 1. High level of commitment: When a person is committed to a task or an event, they are likely to have a strong motivation to fulfill their obligations towards that commitment. In the case of the woman, being committed implies that she values her promises and will make an effort to keep them. Therefore, choosing \\"definitely\\" as the answer would suggest that her commitment increases her likelihood to show up. 2. Potential consequences of not showing up: One possible reason to select \\"definitely\\" as the answer could also stem from the repercussions of not showing up to the event. The woman's absence might have negative consequences for herself or others involved in the event, causing her to prioritize her attendance. In this context, her commitment serves as a driving factor to ensure her presence. 3. The power of intent: The woman's statement about possibly showing up demonstrates her intent to attend the event. While it is not an absolute guarantee, it does indicate a more positive inclination, as opposed to the other choices, such as \\"won't\\" or \\"unlikely.\\" The expression of intent serves as a motivating factor and can be taken into account while choosing \\"definitely\\" as the answer. 4. Interpreting the context: It is crucial to understand the context in which the woman made the statement about showing up. If her words were deemed sincere and genuine, the probability of her actually attending the event could be quite high. In this scenario, selecting \\"definitely\\" as the answer would be more fitting than the other alternatives. 5. Social aspect: Humans are social beings and often fulfill commitments to maintain harmony and relationships. Given this understanding, the woman might be more inclined to show up to maintain her reputation and connections with other people involved in the event. In this sense, choosing \\"definitely\\" reflects an understanding of typical human behavior associated with commitment and social belonging. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"definitely\\" as the answer revolves around the high level of commitment portrayed by the woman, potential consequences if she fails to attend the event, her intent and the context in which the statement was made, and the social aspect of fulfilling commitments. While uncertainties still remain, these factors combined indicate a strong likelihood of the woman showing up, leading to the selection of \\"definitely\\" among all given choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois to Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an advertising executive and former actor, and Dorothy (nee Nidelman), a former radio actress. His father is Irish and his mother is Jewish. A younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Ford's paternal grandparents, John Fitzgerald Ford and Florence Veronica Niehaus, were of Irish Catholic and German descent, respectively. Context: In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin, Ford traveled to Los Angeles to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a 150-a-week contract with Columbia Pictures' New Talent program, playing bit roles in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking roles (or \\"extra\\" work) in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy. Ford managed to secure other roles in movies, such as A Time for Killing (The Long Ride Home), starring Glenn Ford; George Hamilton; and Inger Stevens.  His speaking roles continued next with Luv (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as \\"Harrison J. Ford\\" in the 1967 Western film A Time for Killing, but the \\"J\\" did not stand for anything, since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the \\"J\\" and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Gunsmoke, Ironside, The Virginian, The F.B.I., Love, American Style, and Kung Fu. He appeared in the western Journey to Shiloh (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film Zabriskie Point as an arrested student protester. Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two young sons.  Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in American Graffiti (1973). Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now (1979); in the latter film he played an army officer named \\"G. Lucas\\". Question: Did he play any other roles. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Harrison Ford played many other roles throughout his career. After his early work in the late 1960s and 1970s, Ford's career took off with roles in successful films like the Star Wars series, where he portrayed Han Solo, and the Indiana Jones franchise, where he played the titular character. Some of his other well-known roles include playing Rick Deckard in Blade Runner (1982) and its sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Jack Ryan in Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994), Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1993), and President James Marshall in Air Force One (1997). Ford has had a long and varied acting career, and these roles are just a selection of the many characters he has brought to life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Andy is participating in this years science fair. He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust.  Which will rust faster given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder?  Hint: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and the hint, the sheet will rust faster than the cylinder. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the sheet has a larger surface area available to react with oxygen in the air, allowing it to rust faster. We can confirm this by observing the experiment in which the sheet took only 2 days to fully rust as compared to the cylinder, which took 4 days to rust. Since the sheet has a greater surface area exposed to other reactants, its reaction rate is higher than that of the cylinder, even though they both contain the same amount of iron."},{"instruction":"Information:  - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA).

The BBC reports diabetes is typically separated into type 1—an immune system disease—and type 2—mostly seen as the result of an unhealthy lifestyle. About 90% to 95% of diabetics are classified as type 2, according to Medical News Today. But: “Diabetes is not the grey mass we have been calling type 2,\\" researcher Leif Groop tells the Guardian. \\"There are really subsets of the disease that require different treatment.\\" Groop's team studied 14,775 diabetics and determined diabetes should actually be broken into five \\"genetically distinct\\" clusters. They are: Cluster 1: Severe autoimmune diabetes. Essentially the same as type 1. Cluster 2: Severe insulin-deficient diabetes. As in cluster 1, strikes young and healthy people, but the immune system isn't at fault. Cluster 3: Severe insulin-resistant diabetes. Bodies of largely overweight people no longer respond to insulin being produced. Cluster 4: Mild obesity-related diabetes. Patients are very overweight but have metabolisms closer to normal than patients in cluster 3. Cluster 5: Mild age-related diabetes. Mild form of diabetes developed by older people. The most common cluster. Each cluster has different risks associated with it, and patients could respond better to different treatments, researchers say. \\"I think it will mean a more individualized therapy [and] a better quality of life,” Groop says. (A study found moderate drinking may lower the risk of diabetes.) Expand this summary.","output":"A recent study published in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology concluded that our understanding of diabetes as being categorized into type 1 and type 2 might be incorrect. Instead, the researchers argue that the disease should be classified into five genetically distinct clusters, each with its own characteristics and treatment requirements. This revised view of diabetes could lead to more targeted and personalized therapies, potentially improving patients' quality of life. Traditionally, diabetes has been split into type 1—or an immune system disease—and type 2, which is often associated with an unhealthy lifestyle. Approximately 90% to 95% of diabetics are classified as having type 2 diabetes. However, the new study, which examined 14,775 diabetics, suggests that the condition is more complex than previously believed. The research team, led by Leif Groop, identified the following five distinct clusters of diabetes: 1. Severe autoimmune diabetes: This cluster is essentially the same as the previously recognized type 1 diabetes, characterized by the immune system attacking cells that produce insulin. 2. Severe insulin-deficient diabetes: Similar to cluster 1, this form of the disease affects young and healthy people but does not involve the immune system. Instead, it is characterized by poor insulin secretion due to other factors. 3. Severe insulin-resistant diabetes: People with this form of diabetes are typically overweight, and their bodies no longer respond effectively to the insulin being produced. This group may be more susceptible to kidney-related complications. 4. Mild obesity-related diabetes: Individuals in this cluster are also highly overweight, but have metabolisms that are closer to normal than those in the severe insulin-resistant group (cluster 3). They often have high insulin resistance but normal insulin secretion capacity. 5. Mild age-related diabetes: This cluster refers to a milder form of diabetes that develops in older people, making it the most common form of the disease. The identification of these five clusters has important implications for diabetes care, as it highlights the different risks, genetic factors, and potential treatments associated with each group. By tailoring treatment plans according to the specific needs of each cluster, healthcare providers can better manage patients' conditions and improve their quality of life. For instance, patients in cluster 2 may benefit from a treatment approach that targets insulin secretion, while those in cluster 3 may require medications that address insulin resistance. Overall, this more nuanced understanding of diabetes has the potential to transform the way the disease is diagnosed, managed, and treated, leading to better patient outcomes. While further research is needed to fully understand these different clusters and their implications, this study represents an important step forward in our understanding of diabetes and its underlying causes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  Now, I have a new situation: Ian is looking to buy a new pair of glasses. When he goes to the eye doctor he is told he is Farsighted.

With his new glasses he is now able to see things that are near him because they focus what he sees farther forward in his eyes,  Answer this question please: Given two objects of differing distances which would be easier for Ian to see, the close object or the far object? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, Ian has farsightedness (hyperopia), which means he can see distant objects clearly but has difficulty seeing nearby objects. Therefore, given two objects of differing distances, it would be easier for Ian to see the far object without his glasses. However, with his new glasses, which are designed to correct his hyperopia by focusing images farther forward in his eye, Ian should be able to see both nearby and distant objects more clearly. So, while wearing his new glasses, Ian would be able to see both the close object and the far object with ease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Process:  - People separate different materials to be recycled - The recyclable materials go to a recycling center - The recycling center further separates the materials - Large equipment compacts the materials into bales - The recyclable materials are shipped to other recycling centers - The other recycling centers further process the materials that center specializes in - The materials are purchased by manufacturers - The manufacturers process the recycled materials the same way they would use new materials - The recycled materials are incorporated into new products.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more landfill sites created happens, how will it affect fewer people are inclined to recycle.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis presented suggests that if more landfill sites are created, it may lead to fewer people being inclined to recycle. This change can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the recycling process. Direct Effects: 1. Decreased recycling rates: With more landfill sites available and fewer people inclined to recycle, there would likely be a reduction in the quantity of materials brought to recycling centers. This would lead to a diminished demand for recycling services and potentially less investment in recycling infrastructure and technology. 2. Reduced recycling efficiency: The recycling process relies on economies of scale to efficiently separate and process materials. A decline in the volume of recyclables could mean that recycling centers are less efficient in their operations due to the loss of these economies. 3. Lower revenue for recycling centers: With a decreased volume of materials being brought to recycling centers, there will be fewer items to be processed and sold to manufacturers, ultimately reducing revenue for these centers. This may lead to the closure of some recycling centers, further exacerbating the problem. Indirect Effects: 1. Environmental impact: An increased number of landfill sites and a decline in recycling rates would most likely result in a higher volume of waste being sent to landfills. This, in turn, can lead to increased methane emissions, groundwater contamination, and other negative environmental consequences. 2. Resource depletion: When fewer materials are recycled, there is a greater need for raw materials to be extracted from the environment to meet manufacturing demand. This can lead to resource depletion, such as deforestation, and increased energy consumption, which would contribute to environmental degradation and climate change. 3. Change in consumer behavior: The perturbation could also result in a shift in consumer behavior. With the increased availability and convenience of landfill sites, individuals may develop an out-of-sight, out-of-mind mentality regarding waste disposal and may become less concerned with recycling. This attitude change could result in increased waste generation and further exacerbate environmental problems. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in landfill sites, combined with a subsequent decline in recycling rates, would have significant direct and indirect effects on the recycling process. There would be negative impacts on the efficiency and effectiveness of recycling centers, as well as broader environmental and societal consequences. Therefore, it is essential to promote recycling and pursue sustainable waste management strategies to minimize these potential adverse effects."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Confessions Context: Junior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi (Takako Matsu) announces to her class that she will resign before spring break. Moriguchi reveals that because the HIV-positive biological father of her daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring Manami (Mana Ashida) to school with her. One day, after school, she returned to the room where Manami was but found her gone. Her daughter was later found drowned in a school swimming pool. She then explains that two pupils in her class, whom she dubs \\"Student A\\" and \\"Student B\\", have murdered her four-year-old daughter. She had found a small bunny purse amongst Manami's belongings which should not have belonged there, which led her to question Shuya, one of her students. Shuya, who immediately admitted killing Manami, mocked her compassionate reaction to his feigned expression of remorse with \\"just kidding\\". Having revealed their identities, she explained that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the Juvenile Law of 1947, turning them in wouldn't make a difference. So to exact revenge on them, she admits injecting her late daughter's biological father's HIV-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Moriguchi's confession and the events before the confession through a series of first-person narratives from Moriguchi and her three students. Naoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara), Student B, becomes a shut-in because he believes he has acquired AIDS from drinking HIV-contaminated milk. His mother (Yoshino Kimura), after spotting the hidden malicious messages in well-wishes cards from Naoki's classmates, realizes her son was somehow involved with an earlier incident. She decides to commit murder-suicide to free her son and herself from torment, but in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills her. The police arrest him for the murder.

Earthquakes seemed to outline a special feature of earth's crust. Earthquakes let scientists know where the crust was moving. This led to the discovery that the Earths crust was broken up into regions, or plates. Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries. This was evidence that continents can move. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Scientists know he plates are in motion. They now know the direction and speed of this motion . Plates dont move very fast. They move only a few centimeters a year. This is about the same rate fingernails grow. So you might wonder, what could cause this motion? What supplies the energy to cause this change?

Movie title: The Bravados Movie plot: Jim Douglas (Gregory Peck) is a rancher who has been pursuing the four outlaws who he believes murdered his wife six months earlier. He rides into the town of Rio Arriba, where four men, Alfonso Parral (Lee Van Cleef), Bill Zachary (Stephen Boyd), Ed Taylor (Albert Salmi) and Lujan (Henry Silva), fitting the description of the men he seeks, are in jail awaiting execution. The town has issued instructions to only allow the hangman Simms (Joe DeRita) to enter the jail, so Douglas is taken to Sheriff Eloy Sanchez's (Herbert Rudley) office to state his business. The town has never had an execution before, so they have brought in a man from another town for do the job. The sheriff allows Douglas into the jail to see the men. They claim they had never seen him before, but he isn't persuaded.In town Douglas sees Josefa Velarde (Joan Collins), who he had met five years previously while in New Orleans. When Douglas originally met her, Josefa had been husband hunting. Since then, she has been looking after her father's ranch after his death. Douglas reveals to her that he has a daughter (Maria Garcia Fletcher). Other inhabitants of the town include businessman Gus Steimmetz, his daughter Emma (Kathleen Gallant) and her fiancé Tom (Barry Coe).Simms, the executioner, arrives the same day.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Linus Pauling,the only person who has won two undivided Nobel Prizes,was born in Portland,Oregon. He attended Washington High School but because of an unimportant detail he did not receive his diploma until 1962,long after he had received his Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Orgon State College in 1922. He had chosen to study his major because he could get a good job with it. He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substance. His interest in the \\"behavior\\" of molecules  led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts,the amino acids ,which are called the\\"building blocks of life\\".In 1950,he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule,a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell. During World WarII,Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security,for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948. However,the use of the atomic bomb near the end of the war turned Pauling in a new direction. Having long worked on the structure of molecules,he took an immediate interest in the deadly effects of nuclear fallout on human molecular structures. From then on,Pauling protested the production of the hydrogen bomb and supported the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. Through his efforts,The NuclearTestBan Treaty,declaring all nuclear tests to be illegal except underground ones,came into effect on October 10,1963,the same day Linus Pauling was awarded the Nobel Peace.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water - The water breakes into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons - Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH - Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis - The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is the absorption of light energy by photosynthetic pigments, primarily chlorophyll, in the chloroplasts of plant cells.  The detailed process can be described as follows: 1. Absorption of light energy: In the first step of photosynthesis, the chloroplasts within the plant cells contain light-absorbing pigments known as chlorophyll. These pigments absorb light energy in the form of photons, primarily from the blue and red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Accessory pigments such as carotenoids and phycobilins are also present to assist with the absorption of light energy. This absorbed energy is used to initiate the process of photosynthesis. 2. The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water: After the absorption of light energy, the water molecules inside the chloroplasts of the plant cells are broken down by specific enzyme-mediated reactions. This process, called photolysis, takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and generates molecular oxygen (O2), hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons (e-). 3. The water breaks into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons: As a result of photolysis, the oxygen gas produced diffuses out of the plant as a waste product, while the hydrogen ions and electrons are used as fuel in the subsequent stages of photosynthesis. 4. Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH: The hydrogen ions and electrons, which were energized by the absorbed light energy in the first step, participate in an enzymatic reaction involving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). This molecule accepts the hydrogen ions and electrons, resulting in the formation of NADPH, a crucial molecule that carries potential energy for the next stage of photosynthesis. 5. Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis: The molecular oxygen (O2) produced during the water breakdown in step 2 diffuses out of the plant through stomata, which are microscopic openings in the plant's leaves that regulate gas exchange. These steps represent the initial phase of photosynthesis, known as the light-dependent reactions, which primarily produce oxygen, NADPH, and an energy-carrying molecule called ATP. These products are subsequently utilized in the second phase of photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), in which carbon dioxide is fixed into carbohydrates that fuel the plant's growth and metabolism."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Generate a question which can yield the answer mentioned in the input.

Kyle had a lot of neck pain compared to Nelson because  Select from the following. * Kyle slept in a straight position.; * Nelson slept in a straight position.;","output":"Kyle slept in a straight position. Kyle and Nelson were close friends and roommates for several years. They were both dedicated and hard-working individuals who rarely took the time to pause and think about their well-being. However, with their busy lives and working hours, they often found themselves in need of a good night's sleep to rejuvenate and face the challenges of the next day. One particular night, both Kyle and Nelson decided to turn in early after a rather taxing day at work. Nelson, being the more mindful and health-conscious of the two, slept in a straight position with his mattresses and pillows aligned to provide proper support to his spine and neck. He had read that this would minimize stresses on his body and help him wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day ahead. On the other hand, Kyle, who had a habit of ignoring the importance of a good sleeping position, lay straight with his arms by his side on a firm mattress without adequate pillow support. Unbeknownst to him, this caused the natural curvature of his neck to become misaligned, increasing pressure on his bones, joints, and muscles throughout the night. As the night wore on, Nelson's body slowly adapted to the comfortable position, allowing him to sink into a deep, restorative sleep. Meanwhile, Kyle's body fought against the unnatural position, causing him to toss and turn and unknowingly exacerbating his neck pain. When morning came, Nelson awoke feeling energized and refreshed. He could hardly tell that his body had been through a strenuous day before. He stretched his limbs and felt the satisfying release of tension from his muscles. His neck felt as good as new, ready to take on the day's challenges. Kyle, however, woke up feeling less than refreshed. His neck pain had only worsened overnight, leaving him with a stiff and uncomfortable sensation. He struggled to lift his head from the pillow, as the stiffness in his neck made simple movements painful and difficult. Concerned for his friend, Nelson offered some helpful advice. He shared his knowledge of the benefits of maintaining proper sleep posture and suggested that Kyle invest in an ergonomic pillow to support the natural curve of his neck. He also recommended some gentle neck stretches and exercises that could help alleviate some of the discomfort Kyle was experiencing. Taking Nelson's advice to heart, Kyle decided to make some changes to his sleeping habits. He purchased an ergonomic pillow designed to support the natural curvature of his neck and practiced proper sleep positioning. Over time, his neck pain subsided, and he too began to wake up feeling revitalized and pain-free. Kyle and Nelson continued to lead their busy lives, but now they both prioritized their health and well-being. They understood the importance of maintaining proper sleep posture, and the impact it had on their overall quality of life. And though their days remained hectic and filled with challenges, their nights were spent enjoying the restorative power of a good night's sleep."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

But, after the nightmare of shopping on Black Friday last year (I had a certificate that I could only use that weekend, so had no choice), this time I planned.  This was last weekend.  I stared shopping at 10:40 in the morning.  Hardly anyone was there.  Merchandise was organized.  Not a single shopping bag to be found!  I found everything I needed.  Somehow, 4 items!! FOUR OF THEM!    Since I was using a gift certificate, I couldn't return or exchange items, so I didn't keep the receipt (that I know of).  One of these items was a gift:-(    Somehow, this didn't happen during the Black Friday from hell with tons of people.  Also, they let people bring their alcohol in there.  Bad idea.

On the positive side, the reviewer appreciates the amazing selection the store offers, emphasizing that they found everything they needed. The merchandise was well-organized, and shopping atmosphere was relatively calm due to the time of day. On the negative side, the reviewer recounts their previous bad experience during Black Friday and mentions a number of issues during their recent shopping trip. They express frustration over the absence of shopping bags, mystery of missing items (four of them) which is a disappointment, and not being able to return or exchange items without a receipt. They also highlight the issue of allow customers to bring alcohol into the store, as they observed an intoxicated girl going up an escalator the wrong way.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: stick How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of obtaining or creating a stick, we can follow several steps and consider various factors that contribute to the process. A stick can be a simple piece of wood or a more elaborate object, like a walking stick or a magic wand. Based on your intention, here's a detailed plan to accomplish this goal: 1. Determine the purpose of the stick: Before obtaining or creating a stick, it is essential to know the purpose it will serve. Is it a walking stick, a decorative piece, a tool, or a toy? Knowing the purpose will allow you to select the appropriate materials, size, and design for the stick. 2. Choose your materials: Depending on the intended use of the stick, you may need different materials such as wood, metal, plastic, or a combination of these. For a natural, wooden stick, consider a hardwood like oak, maple, or hickory for durability. For a decorative or magical stick, you might prefer materials such as gemstones, glass, or metal accents. 3. Find a suitable source for the materials: If you want a natural wooden stick, you can find one in a local park, forest, or your own backyard. Look for fallen branches, ensuring they are not rotten or infested with insects. For a more refined stick, you can visit a lumber yard, woodworker's store, or online retailers that supply various materials. 4. Gather tools and equipment: Based on the materials you have chosen and the level of refinement desired, gather all the necessary tools and equipment. These may include a saw, knife, sandpaper, wood carving tools, a lathe, metalworking tools, drills, or glue guns. 5. Learn the necessary techniques: If you’re unfamiliar with wood carving, metalworking, or crafting techniques, do some research and learn the necessary skills. There are numerous books, videos, and online tutorials to guide you through the process. 6. Design your stick: Sketch out a design for your stick, considering factors such as length, thickness, handle design, and any decorative elements you'd like to include. This sketch will serve as a blueprint during the creation process. 7. Prepare the materials: If you've chosen a natural wooden stick, you'll need to clean and strip off the bark. For refined materials like lumber or metal, cut them to the appropriate length and width, following your design. 8. Carve and shape the stick: Using your carving tools, carefully shape the stick according to your design. Ensure the handle is comfortable to grip and all the edges are smooth. If you're adding decorative accents or functionality (such as a walking stick with a concealed storage compartment), focus on these details during this step. 9. Finish and protect the stick: Sand the stick with finer grit sandpaper to get a smooth finish. Apply wood stain, paint, or varnish to enhance its appearance and protect it from wear and tear. For additional protection, you can use a sealant. 10. Add decorative elements or accessories: Attach any additional materials, such as gemstones, metal accents, or other decorative pieces, using appropriate adhesives or hardware. You can also add accessories like a lanyard, wrist strap, or a rubber tip for a walking stick. 11. Inspect the final product: Once your stick is complete, give it a thorough inspection to ensure it is safe to use and free from any defects. Test it for its intended purpose, making sure it meets your expectations and requirements. By following these steps and considering the purpose, materials, and design, you'll be able to successfully accomplish the goal of obtaining or creating a stick suited to your needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January. President Bush's dog Barney, left, plays in 2001 with Spot, the offspring of George H.W. Bush's dog Millie. It's a good thing Obama said \\"Yes, we can\\" to the girls' request to getting a dog; for all of his charm, ability, and oratorical flair, he could never be our nation's chief executive without a White House pet. Counting Obama, the country has had 44 Presidents, and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets. Like Obama himself, the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill. Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high. iReport.com: What pet would you want if you lived in the White House? Here are a few of our favorites:  Watch Obama on \\"mutts like me\\" ». 1. Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus. Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets. After taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections. He had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo ». Billy was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age. He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.) Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success. He sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring. Mental Floss: 7 crafty zoo escapes. 2. The White House gators. Herbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, and ... a gator in the Oval Office? It's true. Hoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds. Sound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests. 3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion. What do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog. In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend. FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala. After that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went. The dog \\"gave\\" 1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala. Fala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone. \\"You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious. \\"He has not been the same dog since!\\" Fala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952. Mental Floss: 6 utterly loyal dogs. 4. Millie: Literary sensation. When George H.W. Bush took office in 1989, he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House. The bubbly canine won over the nation's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush. Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989. Just as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House, so did Millie: when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office, so did his dog, Millie's son Spot Fetcher. 5. Barney, Miss Beazley & India: The current residents. Sadly, Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004, but the Bushes aren't pet-deprived now. They have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley, both of whom have websites and appear in White House-produced web videos. (Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by \\"Willie.\\"  Watch Barney bite a reporter ». The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs \\"Bush.\\" The name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben \\"El Indio\\" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher. Other first pets of note:. Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers. Pauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption. Old Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco. Laddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 \\"interview\\" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs. Liberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations. Socks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie. Gamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House. Two tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo. Satan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno. Jonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name, he wrote to a friend, \\"partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear's character.\\" Dr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs. Josiah -- Roosevelt also had a pet badger, of course. Bonus trivia: Checkers. Nixon's dog was immortalized in the \\"Checkers speech,\\" which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions. He said the only gift he'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters. Mental Floss: Why was the 'Checkers speech' so important? Checkers, however, was never the White House dog. This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 election, and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket. Although the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House, Checkers never got to be First Dog; he passed away in 1964. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com.

A website is offering a bounty of more than 16,000 in cash and other prizes for the first person to successfully hack the Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the new iPhone 5S. The site, IsTouchIDHackedYet, was created by Nick DePetrillo, an independent computer-security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones, and Robert David Graham, owner of Errata Security, a cybersecurity firm. It invites donors to contribute to the bounty, which so far includes an assortment of cash, bitcoins (a form of digital currency), several bottles of booze and \\"a dirty sex book.\\" A successful hack of the phone had not been verified as of Monday morning, although a German hackers' group claimed over the weekend to have bypassed the biometric security of the iPhone 5S by photographing a fingerprint left on a glass surface and using the image to create a fake finger to unlock the phone. They demonstrated their exploits in this video. \\"We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you canÂ´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token,\\" said Frank Rieger, a spokesperson for the group, the Chaos Computer Club, in a post online. How secure is your iPhone 5S fingerprint? According to terms DePetrillo posted on Twitter, to collect the bounty a hacker must lift a fingerprint from the phone or elsewhere and reproduce it in such a way that will allow them to unlock an iPhone 5S in less than five tries. All the steps must be documented on video. \\"The whole point of #istouchidhackedyet was to put up or shut up with regards to criticisms of Apple's Touch ID security and implementation,\\" DePetrillo said Saturday on Twitter. \\"I personally believe (for once) a company has implemented a unique feature (Touch ID) in a reasonably secure way,\\" he added in another tweet. DePetrillo tweeted Sunday that he had been in contact with the Chaos Computer Club and was \\"waiting on a complete video documentation of the process (of their hack) before declaring valid.\\" The iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday, has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Apple calls the new security system Touch ID. Phone owners must \\"register\\" their print with the device, after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button. Other users' fingerprints will not unlock the phone, which protects it from thieves. The Touch ID system is meant for human fingerprints, of course, but it apparently works with animals, too. A Minnesota man posted a video Friday to CNN iReport that showed him using the paw of his pet Chihuahua to unlock his new iPhone. DePetrillo and Graham are so-called \\"white hat\\" hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems. Tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues, which they can then patch before users' personal information is compromised. Apple did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment.

The Fast and the Furious has yet again defied expectations with this fifth installment, quickly securing a spot in the hearts of series veterans and newcomers alike. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone unapologetically confesses his newfound love for the film, stating, \\"Bless me, father of all critic gods, for I have sinned: I liked Fast Five. I watched the cars smashing in IMAX and smiled.\\" While the acting in the film may not be winning any Oscars, it seems that the cast has embraced the sheer fun of it all and allowed their endearing ineptitude to create a truly immersive experience that is simply enjoyable. According to Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe, Fast Five is “the most honest Hollywood movie of the year,” offering fun and excitement without even a hint of pretentiousness. The chemistry between Vin Diesel and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has been praised as well, as Morris describes them as \\"the Pacino and De Niro of absurdly muscled, totally bald, racially mixed action heroes.\\" Chicago Sun-Times' renowned critic Roger Ebert, although not entirely in love with the film, admits to the undeniable appeal of Fast Five's relentless action sequences and borderline ridiculous stunts. The movie is made up of \\"sheer, preposterous, and nonstop impossible action, muscular macho guys, hot chicks,\\" and ultimately incompetent villains. While Ebert laments the lack of laughs in the film, audiences will undoubtedly find joy in the film's electrifying energy and fast-paced nature. Kyle Smith of the New York Post has one minor complaint about Fast Five: \\"Until the finale, it has no car chases to speak of,\\" leaving viewers with \\"a lot of dull caper-plotting.\\" While this may be true, the film's explosive finale more than makes up for any lulls in the action. Moreover, Fast Five's two-hour runtime might seem extensive at first, but Smith notes that it's \\"because it takes that long to read every item in the cliché dictionary.\\" The familiarity with classic action tropes lends a sense of comfort to audiences while still maintaining the thrill Fast Five delivers. In conclusion, Fast Five has firmly established itself as a standout in the sea of sequels, offering fans a thrilling, action-packed experience that defies traditional expectations for a fifth installment. Critics who may have initially dismissed the film have found themselves caught up in the undeniable fun of the franchise, proving that even seasoned reviewers can't help but smile at the absurdity and excitement the Fast and the Furious series continues to bring. With Fast Five, it seems that the iconic characters and their gravity-defying stunt sequences have captured hearts all around, providing viewers with a much-needed dose of enjoyable entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A 34-year-old employee, who was merely unlocking the doors, was knocked down by a massive crowd. This unfortunate incident highlights the often ruthless nature of shopping and raises concerns about the safety precautions taken by both store officials and shoppers themselves. According to eyewitnesses, the crowd had begun forming outside the store as early as 9 p.m. on Thursday. It was a clear indication of the immense popularity of the sales event and a testament to the appeal of unbeatable discounts. However, the incident that soon unfolded would cast a dark shadow on the otherwise festive atmosphere. As the 34-year-old Wal-Mart employee, entrusted with the task of unlocking the store's doors, unsuspectingly approached the entrance, he was met with a stampede of eager bargain hunters who could not contain their excitement. Pushed to the ground and unfortunately injured, the incident raises several questions pertaining to crowd control measures during such events and whether shopping venues should consider implementing stricter safety protocols to avoid calamities like this in the future. In an unrelated, yet equally tragic event taking place the same evening, two men were shot dead at a Toys \\"R\\" Us in California. Despite the fact that this terrifying incident was unrelated to the shopping frenzy, it only serves to heighten the alarm surrounding the vulnerabilities and risks consumers face when shopping. Officials say the toy store shootings are unrelated to the shopping hysteria and that the true cause is still under investigation. Nevertheless, the heinous crime demonstrates the potential for violence to erupt in any setting, and the need for upgraded security measures to be taken, not only during sale events but also on a day-to-day basis. These unfortunate episodes remind us of the darker side of the shopping experience and the necessity for greater caution and vigilance while attending such events. Store owners and consumers alike share a responsibility to ensure that safety protocols and measures are put in place and observed, guaranteeing a secure and enjoyable shopping experience for all. In conclusion, both the tragic events at Wal-Mart and Toys \\"R\\" Us are a stark reminder of the potential threats that lie hidden amidst the quest for discounts and good deals. While we all love to indulge in the excitement of securing a bargain, we must not forget the importance of prioritizing safety above all else. The onus is now on retailers, security personnel, and shoppers to work collectively to prevent similar events from unfolding in the future, while ensuring a secure retail environment for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase is: \\"Attack them harder and take a chance to survive a little longer... ...longer than the others!\\" 1. \\"Attack them harder\\":    In Spanish, \\"attack\\" is translated to \\"atacar\\", \\"them\\" to \\"ellos\\", and \\"harder\\" to \\"más fuerte\\". So, this part of the sentence would be \\"Ataca a ellos más fuerte\\". 2. \\"and take a chance\\":    In Spanish, \\"and\\" is translated to \\"y\\", \\"take\\" to \\"tomar\\" and \\"a chance\\" to \\"una oportunidad\\". So, this part of the sentence would be \\"y toma una oportunidad\\". 3. \\"to survive a little longer\\":    Here, \\"to survive\\" is translated to \\"para sobrevivir\\", \\"a little\\" to \\"un poco\\", and \\"longer\\" to \\"más tiempo\\". So, this part of the sentence would be \\"para sobrevivir un poco más tiempo\\". 4. \\"longer than the others\\":    In Spanish, \\"than\\" is translated to \\"que\\", and \\"the others\\" to \\"los demás\\". So, this part of the sentence would be \\"más tiempo que los demás\\". Now I'm going to combine all the components to form the complete sentence: \\"Ataca a ellos más fuerte y toma una oportunidad para sobrevivir un poco más tiempo... ...más tiempo que los demás!\\" This is a faithful translation of the original sentence in Spanish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Tatchell was born in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a lathe operator and his mother worked in a biscuit factory. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards. Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve \\"poofs\\" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972.  In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the Communist Party of Great Britain and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, was interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists.  Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West.  Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in The Guardian that:  [The] GLF was a glorious, enthusiastic and often chaotic mix of anarchists, hippies, leftwingers, feminists, liberals and counter-culturalists. Despite our differences, we shared a radical idealism - a dream of what the world could and should be - free from not just homophobia but the whole sex-shame culture, which oppressed straights as much as LGBTs. We were sexual liberationists and social revolutionaries, out to turn the world upside down. [...] GLF's main aim was never equality within the status quo. [...] GLF's strategy for queer emancipation was to change society's values and norms, rather than adapt to them. We sought a cultural revolution to overturn centuries of male heterosexual domination and thereby free both queers and women. [...] Forty years on, GLF's gender agenda has been partly won. [...] Girlish boys and boyish girls don't get victimised as much as in times past. LGBT kids often now come out at the age of 12 or 14. While many are bullied, many others are not.

Low-income domestic violence victims may find long-term legal help -- representation in divorces or child-custody disputes -- hard to come by, if two organizations now providing such help can't replace their lost funding. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than 450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The 175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake. Although an order's requirements that an abuser stay away from a victim may remain in effect for years, protective orders only settle issues such as child custody, child support, custody and property arrangements for 150 days. Many judges are reluctant to address those issues in emergency protective orders, since the decrees stay in effect for such a short time, Milne and Ralphs said. \\"The likelihood a victim will return to her abuser increases if she cannot permanently sever the relationship and establish workable support, custody and property arrangements,\\" the funding request to CVR said. The Department of Justice said it denied the grant application, in part, because evaluators did not see enough collaboration between the organizations and victims' advocates, Ralphs and Milne told CVR board members. While the two said they believe their organizations coordinate well, the organizations cannot appeal the grant denial. Although CVR board members considered giving the money as a loan, not a grant, their vote on the funding request -- taken after Milne and Ralphs left the meeting -- was unanimous.

Founded by Dantidurga around 753, the Rashtrakuta Empire ruled from its capital at Manyakheta for almost two centuries. At its peak, the Rashtrakutas ruled from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions.[citation needed] The early kings of this dynasty were Hindu but the later kings were strongly influenced by Jainism. Govinda III and Amoghavarsha were the most famous of the long line of able administrators produced by the dynasty. Amoghavarsha, who ruled for 64 years, was also an author and wrote Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada work on poetics. Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora. Other important contributions are the sculptures of Elephanta Caves in modern Maharashtra as well as the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in modern Karnataka, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Arab traveler Suleiman described the Rashtrakuta Empire as one of the four great Empires of the world. The Rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the golden age of southern Indian mathematics. The great south Indian mathematician Mahāvīra (mathematician) lived in the Rashtrakuta Empire and his text had a huge impact on the medieval south Indian mathematicians who lived after him. The Rashtrakuta rulers also patronised men of letters, who wrote in a variety of languages from Sanskrit to the Apabhraṃśas.

And it's no surprise for many of us to dream of doing business when we grow up. However, Moziah Bridge tells us quite different story. Moziah Bridges is now the CEO of his Mo's Bow's company. He has already earned 200,000 by selling bow ties and other men's fashion accessories . The boy designs all the bow ties together with seven other workers in the company, including his mother and grandmother. \\"Mo is the CEO of the company, but I am the CEO of Mo,\\" Bridges' grandma said. About four years ago, when Bridges went shopping for bow ties, he found they were in ugly\\"  black and red. He wanted a change. So he asked his grandma to teach him to sew and finally he developed the talent of creating bow ties. Though his very first bow tie didn't look nice, the young sewer kept on practicing. He used colorful cloth with different pictures. Then his parents and friends started to like his works. At first he tried to sell them online to several stores in the south. Soon Mo's bow ties became popular. With the help of Dayond John, CEO of the famous US clothes brand FUBU, Bridges built his own company. Not only did Daymond John provide money for him, but also produced Bridges to the circle of fashion and business industries. Now the 13-year-old's business has developed rapidly.

By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.Canada entered the Second World War in 1939.

Question: \\"What have scientists used to learn more about the timeline for birds' evolution?\\"  Context: \\"The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving dinosaurs, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs. True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early \\"stem-birds\\", such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Scientists have used a combination of methodologies and evidence to learn more about the timeline for birds' evolution. This includes the examination of fossils, analysis of DNA, and the study of geologic events. Here's a summary of the key aspects: 1. Fossil Evidence: Fossils have provided crucial information about the morphology and anatomy of extinct bird species and their ancestors. Archaeopteryx, for instance, is an early stem-bird dating back to the mid-Jurassic period with features of both dinosaurs and birds. Researchers have discovered various fossils of feathered theropod dinosaurs that lie outside the class Aves, but are part of the broader group Avialae, indicating the gradual evolution of birds from their dinosaurian ancestors. 2. DNA-based Evidence: By analyzing the DNA of living birds and their closest living relatives, scientists have gained insights into the diversification and evolutionary relationships among bird species. Molecular clock dating techniques, which make use of DNA sequence differences to estimate the age of divergence between species, have suggested that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs. 3. Geologic Events: Studies of geologic events, such as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and global cooling periods, provide essential context for understanding bird evolution. These events have shaped the distribution of bird species and the ways they have adapted to their environments over time. For example, bird species in South America survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and subsequently colonized other parts of the world via land bridges, diversifying in response to changing climatic conditions. 4. Comparative Anatomy and Paleobiology: Comparing the skeletal structures and morphological traits of extinct bird-like dinosaurs and living birds helps scientists understand the functional adaptations and constraints that have shaped avian evolution. For example, early stem-birds shared many features with their theropod dinosaur ancestors, such as toothy jaws and long bony tails, but they also displayed adaptations for powered flight, including the presence of feathers, a wishbone, and other skeletal modifications. In summary, scientists have used a multidisciplinary approach, combining fossil evidence, DNA analysis, the study of geologic events, and comparative anatomy to learn more about the timeline for birds' evolution, uncovering their origins from feathered dinosaur ancestors, their diversification following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, and their adaptations to changing environments over millions of years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which case the reactants concentration would decrease, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In order to determine which case would result in a decrease in reactant concentration, we first need to understand what is happening in each case. Case E: Equilibrium At equilibrium, the rate of forward reaction equals the rate of reverse reaction. The concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant over time. In this case, the reactant concentration is constant and does not decrease or increase. Case T: Temperature change Changing the temperature of a system at equilibrium can cause a shift in the equilibrium position, either favoring the forward reaction or the reverse reaction. The specific effect of temperature change on reactant and product concentrations depends on whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. Case A: Forward reaction favored In case A, the forward reaction is favored, meaning that there is a higher rate of reactants converting into products compared to the reverse reaction. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentration of reactants will decrease over time, as more reactants are being consumed to form products. Case B: Reverse reaction favored In case B, the reverse reaction is favored, which implies that the rate of products converting back into reactants is higher than the conversion of reactants into products. In this scenario, the initial concentration of reactants will not decrease – instead, it will either remain constant or even increase as products are transformed back into reactants at a higher rate. From this understanding, we can conclude that the reactants concentration would decrease in case A, where the forward reaction is favored. This is because, in case A, there is a higher rate of reactants being consumed to form products compared to the reverse reaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The connection between Gerry Rafferty and Sherlock Holmes may not be immediately obvious, but it can be found when we delve into their respective worlds: the world of music and the world of literature. Specifically, the link between these two seemingly disparate figures is associated with the iconic location of Baker Street. Gerry Rafferty (1947-2011) was a Scottish singer-songwriter best known for his hit songs \\"Baker Street\\" (1978) and \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\" (1972, recorded with his band Stealers Wheel). The former song, \\"Baker Street,\\" is an iconic piece that defines Rafferty's career, characterized by Raphael Ravenscroft's haunting saxophone riff. The song's lyrics reflect on themes of alienation, disillusionment, and the search for personal and creative freedom. Sherlock Holmes, on the other hand, is a fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930), a British writer and physician. Holmes first appeared in the novel \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" (1887) and subsequently starred in a series of novels and short stories. Known for his brilliant mind, logical reasoning, and meticulous observation skills, Holmes quickly became a classic and enduring character in detective fiction. The stories featuring Holmes and his friend and chronicler Dr. John Watson were set primarily in late 19th-century and early 20th-century London. The connection between Gerry Rafferty and Sherlock Holmes arises through the physical and metaphorical significance of Baker Street. In the world of Sherlock Holmes, 221B Baker Street is the fictional address of his residence and office. Dr. Watson and he shared the flat, which served as their base for solving various mysteries and criminal cases. Due to the immense popularity of Doyle's stories, Baker Street became synonymous with detective work and, in particular, with the character of Sherlock Holmes. In Rafferty's \\"Baker Street,\\" the London thoroughfare stands as a symbol of the singer's journey toward self-discovery and personal growth. The song's introspective and evocative lyrics describe a man who feels lost in the city, pondering life and yearning for change. In this context, Baker Street embodies the universal struggles of human existence – the constant search for meaning, identity, and connection in an often confusing and alienating world. The link between the two lies in Baker Street representing an essential part of their identity: For Sherlock Holmes, it is his home and workplace, a nucleus of his investigative career, while for Gerry Rafferty, it symbolizes the core of his self-exploration and artistic expression. In conclusion, the link between Gerry Rafferty and Sherlock Holmes is established through the common ground of Baker Street. Despite their distinct realms of existence – one a musician and the other a fictional detective – their shared connection to Baker Street serves as a powerful thread that ties them together. This connection transcends time and space, illustrating the lasting impact and relevance of both Rafferty's music and Doyle's iconic detective in popular culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky...  Guess a valid title for it!

So, we have -38 * d (which means -38 times d) plus 42 * d (which means 42 times d) and it equals 16. Now, imagine you have -38 apples with d painted on each, and you also have 42 apples with d painted on each. Let's put all the apples together in one big basket. So we'd have (-38 + 42) apples with d painted on them. Since we're adding a smaller negative number to a bigger positive number, we know the result will be positive.  Now let's count the apples: We have 42 and we take away 38, which leaves us with 4 apples. So, the equation turns into: 4 * d = 16. Now we want to find out how many times the number painted on the apple (d) fits into 16. If we divide the number 16 by the number of apples we have (which is 4), we'll find the answer: 16 divided by 4 is 4. So, the missing number (d) is 4!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Okay, this isn’t exactly staying up all night, but taking a nap for even a few minutes can improve performance and minimize signs of sleepiness. Even a little shut eye can help you stay up for the rest of the night.  One study found that people did better with just a 26-minute nap. So shut your eyes for just a little bit, and you should find it easier to make it through the entire night and next day. The key here is to take a short nap because otherwise you could end up in a deep sleep, which is very hard to wake out of. You could also sleep a little bit longer the night before you know you will be up all night. The body will “bank” the sleep, and it will be easier to get through the stretch of sleeplessness without it. Your body clock is actually aware of changes in light and darkness, and you will feel more awake in the light. The body clock is linked physically to the eyes.  If you’re super tired the next day, go outside. The sunlight will also function to wake your body up more. The darkness causes the body to produce melatonin, which is the sleep hormone. People’s instinct is often to turn down the lights at night, but that’s probably going to make you more sleepy as the body perceives it’s time to call it a night. Turning the lights higher than normal will trick the body. The brain is going to be more alert after you move a bit. If you don’t have time to exercise, you could just engage in a conversation, wash the dishes – do something to focus your body on a new action for a time.  Changing an activity also might wake the body up more. The body will become more alert to compensate for the new activity. The body feels less tired when you’re busy because it will focus on the task instead of the lack of sleep. Mental activities also may help you stay awake by keeping your focus on something other than the fact you're tired. So try playing a game. Some mental activities, like reading a book, may make you more sleepy, though, especially if you do them while lying down. You could listen to a talking radio show though. The body temperature naturally lowers during sleep, so people sleep better when it’s colder. However, a hot room is probably going to make you feel drowsy.  Other ways to trick the body into feeling more wakeful include taking a cold shower and getting dressed up for your day. In addition to turning down the room temperature, you could also open a window. The breeze should help you stay awake, in addition to the lower temperature (if it's cool outside). Summary:","output":"Taking a short nap, even for just a few minutes, can improve performance and reduce signs of sleepiness, helping you stay awake longer. A 26-minute nap has been found to be effective in a study. It is essential to avoid long naps, as they can lead to deep sleep which is harder to awaken from. Banking sleep by sleeping longer the night before an all-nighter can also be helpful. The body clock is aware of changes in light and darkness, and adjusting lighting can help regulate wakefulness. Brighter lights can make you feel more awake, while darkness increases the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Engaging in physical or mental activities can also keep the body alert and focused, preventing feelings of sleepiness. Some activities may make you more tired, so choose actions that are stimulating and engage your mind. Finally, controlling the room temperature can help you stay awake. A colder room is better for sleep, but a hot room can make you feel drowsy. To feel more wakeful, try lowering the room temperature, opening a window, taking a cold shower, or dressing up for the day. These strategies work by tricking the body into feeling more alert and awake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Forget about secondhand smoke or secondhand vapor. Worry more about secondhand stupidity - Greg Gutfeld I'm sure you knew that, but now it's conclusive. They want to ban e-cigarettes at the Capitol. Yes, they feel that e-cigs are no different than regular smokes. Notice how I said \\"feel\\" and not \\"think. Yet they admit they have no research to back this garbage up. They're concerned that others might be exposed to vapor. Yes, people who accuse the right of being anti-science are terrified by a substance found in fog. But I guess they should also ban nicotine gum too which, like e-cigs, are non-tobacco delivery systems that replace deadly smoking. These morons claim it's all about promoting health, but they're too dumb to see e-cigs are doing exactly that. I haven't had a real smoke in months thanks to e-cigs. Ban them and people will smoke the real thing. Maybe that's the point. Henry Waxman wants me dead. Of course, their cowardly and profoundly infantile defense will always be about perceived danger -- that way you don't have to come up with facts. Hence our new villain is secondhand water vapor.

The author, Greg Gutfeld, disparages these politicians for their perceived ignorance and lack of scientific understanding in their decision. The following points are the most important: 1. Disagreement with a Proposed E-Cigarette Ban: Gutfeld vehemently disagrees with the aforementioned politicians' desire to ban e-cigarettes, which he contrasts as being no different from regular cigarettes in their eyes, despite a lack of credible research to substantiate this claim. 2. E-cigarettes as Non-Harmful: The author strongly advocates for e-cigarettes, stating they are a less harmful alternative to regular smoking, reducing the health risks associated. 3. Exposure to Vapor Concerns: He criticizes the politicians' concerns of people being exposed to vapor, a substance found in fog, comparing the harmlessness of these substances to the harmless mist from a teapot or a sauna and jokingly warns against steaming pantsuits. 4. E-cigarettes as a Smoking Cessation Aid: He credits e-cigarettes as a non-tobacco delivery system that is helping him to quit smoking traditional cigarettes and improves health. Banning e-cigarettes, he suggests, would drive people back to harmful tobacco smoking. 5. Pointing Out Hypocrisy: Gutfeld makes a point of drawing attention to these politicians - who accuse their political opponents of being 'anti-science' - appearing to disregard scientific evidence themselves regarding e-cigarettes and their potential benefits. 6. Secondhand Stupidity: The most prominent metaphor used in the text is \\"secondhand stupidity\\", which refers to Gutfeld's belief that these politicians are spreading ignorance and misconceptions about e-cigarettes, which are potentially more harmful than the secondhand smoke or vapor they aim to eradicate. In summarizing, this text is essentially a satirical and sharply critical commentary on the moves by some politicians to ban e-cigarettes, contesting that their decisions are not grounded in scientific evidence and may potentially do more harm than good."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The two questions are not paraphrases of each other; they address different aspects of search engine optimization (SEO). The first question focuses on the importance of obtaining backlinks from high PageRank (PR) sites or specific high PR pages, while the second question asks for on-page and off-page SEO checklists for a website. Let's address each question in detail. 1. Do you need to build backlinks from a high PR site or high PR page? Backlinks, also known as inbound or incoming links, are crucial for SEO, as they are considered as votes for a website's credibility and authority by search engines. High-quality backlinks can significantly improve a website's search engine rankings. In the past, PageRank was a primary factor that search engines like Google used to determine a webpage's importance. A high PR site or page indicated a more authoritative and relevant source. However, Google no longer reports public PR scores, and modern SEO practices focus more on the overall quality and relevance of the links and the websites providing those links. Instead of focusing solely on PR, it is essential to consider other factors like domain authority, relevance, and trustworthiness. A few high-quality and relevant backlinks from authoritative sites are more valuable than numerous low-quality or irrelevant links from less reputable sources. So, strategically building backlinks from relevant and authoritative sites or pages is crucial for your website's SEO success. 2. What are the on-page SEO and off-page SEO checklists for a website? On-page SEO and off-page SEO are two critical aspects of optimizing a website for search engines, and they have different requirements and checklists. Here is a breakdown of both on-page and off-page SEO checklists: On-page SEO Checklist: a.

Answer a question about this article: In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production centre of East China. Overenthusiastic in building a “world-class” industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries, namely, electronics, cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless. The mistakes the government made during this period resulted in what type of growth?","output":"The mistakes the government made during this period resulted in negative economic growth. This negative growth was primarily due to several factors and missteps by the government in their pursuit of rapidly industrializing the nation. To provide a bit of context, the 1950s marked the period after the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established by the Communist Party of China (CPC). The government was ambitious about transforming the country into a heavy industry production hub, specifically for East China. As a result, they placed a great deal of investment into building state-owned heavy industries that fell under a national plan to expedite industrialization. Despite their well-intentioned goals, the government made several disastrous mistakes in the development process. One significant error was their decision to spend hundreds of millions of yuan in an futile attempt to mine for non-existent coal. Not only was this a financially wasteful endeavor, but it was also detrimental to the economy, which actually contracted during the late 1960s stage, leading to the negative economic growth mentioned in the article. From the 1960s to 1980s, the government identified and fostered five pillar industries: electronics, cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each backed by big state-owned enterprises. However, following the Reform and Opening policy which aimed to transition China's economy towards a more market-oriented model, these state-owned enterprises struggled to compete against efficient multinational firms and dynamic local private firms. They found themselves ensnared in heavy debt, leading some to go bankrupt or be forced into privatization. These factors contributed significantly to the negative economic growth experienced during this period. Additionally, this disruption in the industrial ecosystem led to massive layoffs, leaving many workers technically not unemployed, but to a large scale, effectively jobless. This further exacerbated the economic challenges, as job loss has a significant correlation with economic performance. Lower employment leads to a decrease in consumer spending, which in turn, depresses economic growth. Thus, the government's mistakes during this period of rapid industrialization and transition to a market economy culminated in a situation of negative economic growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession   with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start. According to the surveys, what influences students further study most? A) Professors' instructions. B) Time management skills. C) Early education at home. D) Freedom in choosing homework. A:","output":"According to the surveys mentioned in the text, the factor that influences students' further study the most is D) Freedom in choosing homework.

Background: De Benneville \\"Bert\\" Bell (February 25, 1895 - October 11, 1959) was the National Football League (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania, where as quarterback, he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. Context: By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.  After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4-7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.  In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted 85,000 (presently, 1,499,017), and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of 4,500 (presently, 79,360). Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles, wherein Bell led the Eagles to a 1-11 finish, their worst record ever. In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. During the Eagles' 2-8-1 1937 season, his second child, John \\"Upton\\", was born. In the Eagles' first profitable season, 1938, they posted a 5-6 record. The Eagles finished 1-9-1 in 1939 and 1-10 in 1940. Question: Did they ever have a winning record while Bell was the owner?.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What authors used a writing style that broke away from the style started during the Han dynasty? , can you please find it?   The Tang period was a golden age of Chinese literature and art. There are over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors that have survived until modern times. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701–762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701–761) and Cui Hao (704–754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (嚴羽; active 1194–1245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713–766) era with \\"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712–770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773–819) and Han Yu (768–824).

His family had migrated to California as many other families from the United States due to the California Gold Rush. His father, Joseph \\"Joe\\" Hooper, was born in Morrell, Prince Edward Island in Canada. Joe was the fourth child and second boy born to English-born William Hooper, Harry's grandfather, and his Portuguese wife Louisa. Breaking into the majors with the Red Sox in 1909, Hooper played in 81 games and hit .282. Between 1910 and 1915, he teamed with Tris Speaker (CF) and Duffy Lewis (LF) to form the Golden Outfield, one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Religious differences may have been the biggest challenge for the Golden Outfield. At the time, a common Protestant sentiment was that Catholics would move to their communities and change the established culture. Speaker, who was a Protestant, once went a year without speaking to Hooper or Lewis, who were both Catholic.  Though Hooper was a hard competitor on the field, he became known for his likable personality and sense of humor, which contrasted with Speaker's tough exterior. Hooper became a favorite with the fans and he established a reputation as a clutch player. He became known as a top-caliber defensive right fielder and a solid leadoff hitter. He invented a maneuver known as the \\"rump-slide\\" for catching shallow fly balls.  In 1910 Hooper played 155 games and hit .267 in a league-leading 688 plate appearances, marking the first of eleven consecutive seasons where he had at least 564 plate appearances. He led all AL outfielders with 30 assists that season, but he also committed a league-high 18 errors. In 130 games the next year, Hooper hit .311; the outfield trio of Hooper, Lewis and Speaker hit .315 combined.  Hooper's batting average dropped to .242 in 1912. Boston won the 1912 World Series, during which Hooper made a catch that The Pittsburgh Press referred to as one of the finest plays in baseball history. The paper noted that Hooper \\"does not seek the limelight. He is reserved and bashful, and every action of his upon the baseball field plainly shows these qualities.\\" On May 30, 1913, Hooper became the first player to hit a home run to lead off both games of a doubleheader, a mark only matched by Rickey Henderson and Brady Anderson over 80 years later. In 1914, he recorded 230 putouts in right field, which was the first of several seasons in which he finished in the top three in that category among right fielders.  On October 13, 1915, in game five of the 1915 World Series, he became the second player to hit two home runs in a single World Series game. Duffy contributed a third home run as the Red Sox won another world championship four games to one. Hooper was also the captain of the Red Sox in 1919.

The time to find and extricate victims is most crucial: once buried by an avalanche, survival chances drop dramatically already after the first 15 minutes. Hypothesis: After a quarter of an hour people are more likely to die when in an avalanche OPTIONS: + Yes. + It's impossible to say. + No.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that after a quarter of an hour, people are more likely to die when in an avalanche from the given context. The context highlights the importance of time in avalanche companion rescue situations and emphasizes that survival chances drop dramatically after the first 15 minutes. This statement indicates a strong correlation between the time taken to find and extricate victims and their likelihood of survival, suggesting that the critical threshold for rescue is within the first 15 minutes after being buried in an avalanche. Wearable sensing technologies aim to enhance the rescue process by improving the chances of locating and extricating victims within this critical timeframe. The faster a victim can be found and freed from the avalanche, the higher their chances of survival. Beyond the first 15 minutes, the probability of survival decreases significantly due to factors such as suffocation, hypothermia, and physical injuries caused by the force of the avalanche. In summary, based on the given context, we can infer and support the hypothesis that \\"After a quarter of an hour, people are more likely to die when in an avalanche.\\" This hypothesis emphasizes the significance of rapid response and effective rescue technologies in increasing the likelihood of victims' survival in avalanche situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Concrete cures best in temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C), so check the forecast for the next week. If you can expect warm temperatures, then now is the right time to pour the concrete.  Pouring in the spring or summer is ideal to avoid any unexpected cold weather. If there is a sudden cold snap after pouring the concrete, professionals usually protect the concrete by building a structure around the site and using a portable heater. This is an expensive option, but it’s the best choice to protect the concrete. While the concrete is curing, it can’t handle excessive weight. Let it dry for a full 24 hours before stepping on it to prevent damage to the surface.  If you’re water-curing the concrete, take extra care to avoid stepping on it while you re-wet the fabric. If the concrete is in an area with a lot of foot traffic, block the area off and hang signs warning about wet cement. Make sure any pedestrians will know they can't step on the area. Even if the concrete looks dry, it can't handle excessive weight until after it cures completely. If the concrete is in your driveway or a similar area that cars drive on, wait at least 10 days before driving or parking your car on it.  If you have a large vehicle like an RV or truck, wait 28 days before parking it on the concrete. Also wait 28 days if this is a commercial area with a lot of vehicle traffic, like a parking lot. The weight from multiple vehicles can cause the concrete to sink. Introducing new chemicals to the concrete before it’s completely hardened can interfere with the curing process. Wait a full month before applying any paints or stains to the concrete. If you do want to paint the concrete and used a curing compound, remember to get one that is nonreactive with paint.

Summarize this article: There are many tables that have information on the average bond energies for a specific bond. These tables can be found online or in a chemistry book. It is important to note that these bond energies are always for molecules in a gaseous state.  For our example, you need to find the bond energy for an H-H bond, a Br-Br bond, and an H-Br bond. H-H = 436 kJ/mol; Br-Br = 193 kJ/mol; H-Br = 366 kJ/mol.  To calculate bond energy for molecules in a liquid state, you need to also look up the enthalpy change of vaporization for the liquid molecule. This is the amount of energy needed to convert the liquid into a gas. This number is added to the total bond energy. For example: If you were given liquid water, you would need to add the enthalpy change of vaporization of water (+41 kJ) to the equation. In some equations, you may have the same bond broken multiple times. For example, if 4 atoms of hydrogen are in the molecule, then the bond energy of hydrogen must be counted 4 times, or multiplied by 4.  In our example, there is only 1 bond of each molecule, so the bond energies are simply multiplied by 1. H-H = 436 x 1 = 436 kJ/mol Br-Br = 193 x 1 = 193 kJ/mol Once you have multiplied the bond energies by the number of the individual bonds, you need to then sum all of the bonds on the reactant side. For our example, the sum of the bonds broken is H-H + Br-Br = 436 + 193 = 629 kJ/mol. Just as you did for the bonds broken on the reactant side, you will multiply the number of bonds formed by its respective bond energy. If you have 4 hydrogen bonds formed, you would need to multiply that bond energy by 4. For our example we have 2 H-Br bonds formed, so the bond energy of H-Br (366 kJ/mol) will be multiplied by 2: 366 x 2 = 732 kJ/mol. Again, like you did with the bonds broken, you will add up all of the bonds formed on the product side. Sometimes you will only have 1 product formed and can skip this step. In our example, there is only 1 product formed, so the energy of the bonds formed is simply the energy of the 2 H-Br bonds or 732 kJ/mol. Once you have summed all of the bond energies for both sides, simply subtract the formed bonds from the broken bonds. Remember the equation: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). Plug in the calculated values and subtract. For our example: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed) = 629 kJ/mol - 732 kJ/mol = -103 kJ/mol. The final step to calculating bond energy is to determine whether the reaction releases energy or consumes energy. An endothermic (one that consumes energy) will have a final bond energy that is positive, while an exothermic reaction (one that releases energy) will have a negative bond energy. In our example, the final bond energy is negative, therefore, the reaction is exothermic. Summary:","output":"This article discusses the process of calculating bond energies for specific chemical bonds, using an H-H bond, a Br-Br bond, and an H-Br bond as examples. Bond energy tables, which provide average bond energy values, can be found online or in chemistry books. It is essential to remember that these values pertain to gaseous molecules. To calculate bond energy for liquid molecules, the enthalpy change of vaporization must be added to the total bond energy. In cases where the same bond is broken multiple times, the bond energy must be multiplied by the number of occurrences. The bond energies of broken and formed bonds must be summed separately, with the overall bond energy determined by subtracting the formed bonds' energy from the broken bonds' energy. A positive final bond energy signifies an endothermic reaction, which consumes energy, while a negative final bond energy indicates an exothermic reaction, which releases energy. In the given example, the reaction is determined to be exothermic due to its negative final bond energy."},{"instruction":"Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away.

The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get.  Which lake will have less dead zones?","output":"Lake Costanza will likely have less dead zones. Since it hardly gets any rain, there is less chance of rain dissolving the fertilizer in the soil and causing runoff to carry the fertilizer into the lake. This would result in less nitrogen entering the lake, reducing the chances of an algal bloom and a subsequent dead zone. On the other hand, Lake Montopeke experiences regular rainfall, which increases the likelihood of fertilizer runoff and associated dead zones."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The food was pretty good, though, maybe a 3.   First, we lined up outside. It felt a little bit like waiting for a ride at the state fair. You really had no idea what was happening, how seating worked, etc, until you got closer.  They had a waitress taking bar orders in line, which frankly is the only reason I stayed at that point. However, you had to close your tab at the time of service.  Once you get in to the counter to order, still not clear on what is going on, you've paid one bill (for the drinks) and are now carrying a massive goblet of beer. You order, are told what # booth you've been granted, and pay again. If you want water, you are given a cup at that time. So, now you've paid twice and are walking around with two beverages in your hand looking for your booth number.  The food came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately, requesting another beverage now means yet another bill I have to pay.  Honestly, I really wanted this place to work. I like the look and the vibe it has. But please, get a proper hostess and seat people normally. Let the waitstaff you've already hired take orders from the table. Get rid of the whole line thing. It's unnecessary and kind of a pain. It's way too much work for a semi-decent burger and a beer or two.  The menu is admittedly very limited. You can have some variation of a burger, a salad, fries, and a drink. Don't expect much else. It's like going to 5 Guy's with a bar and a trendy atmosphere. The waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. I know they all were, because literally every one of them waited on us at some point. That alone was confusing as well. I never knew who to flag down when I wanted another beer.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What was the colloquial name for Polish Cochineal?\\"  Context: \\"There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was Kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \\"Kermes\\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz), made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii, an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which brightened the color.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The colloquial name for Polish Cochineal is \\"Blood of Saint John\\".

Context: In 212 BC, the Emperor Qin Shi Huang commanded all books in the Qin Empire other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the Burning of books and burying of scholars of 212 BC, the Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for Chinese pagoda towers, engineering, surveying, and includes material on right triangles. It created mathematical proof for the Pythagorean theorem, and a mathematical formula for Gaussian elimination. The treatise also provides values of π, which Chinese mathematicians originally approximated as 3 until Liu Xin (scholar) (d. 23 AD) provided a figure of 3.1457 and subsequently Zhang Heng (78-139) approximated pi as 3.1724, as well as 3.162 by taking the square root of 10. Liu Hui commented on the Nine Chapters in the 3rd century AD and Liu Huis π algorithm accurate to 5 decimal places (i.e. 3.14159). Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD Zu Chongzhi computed Milü to seven decimal places (i.e. 3.141592), which remained the most accurate value of π for almost the next 1000 years. He also established a method which would later be called Cavalieris principle to find the volume of a sphere. Question: Which Chinese scholars estimated the value of pi?

UPDATED:. 16:24 EST, 5 October 2012. Tax avoidance: Anne Robinson, pictured, has avoided paying £4million after joining the Liberty tax strategy, it was claimed. Anne Robinson avoided paying tax on £4million after joining an aggressive scheme to shelter earnings from the Treasury, it was claimed yesterday. The BBC Watchdog presenter was one of the largest participants in the Liberty tax strategy which enabled investors to pay just 7p in the pound to the company rather than 40 per cent income tax. Take That stars Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen were also reported to be among the 2,000 who tried to shelter a total of £1.2billion from the taxman in the scheme between 2004 and 2008. It is the latest revelation about legal but aggressive tax avoidance schemes used by celebrities and the super-rich which the Prime Minister has described as ‘morally repugnant’. HM Revenue and Customs believe that personal tax avoidance costs the economy £4.5billion a year. Liberty exploited a loophole to buy and sell dividends offshore to generate more than £1billion in artificial losses which members could offset against their tax bills. It meant higher-rate taxpayers could earn £1million a year tax free by paying £70,000 in fees to Leeds company Mercury Tax Strategies, which provided the scheme. Miss Robinson, 68, was reported to have avoided tax on about £4million through Liberty after paying £280,000 in fees. Barlow attempted to shelter at least £3million after paying £210,000, Owen attempted to shelter at least £1.4million after paying £101,500, and Donald attempted to shelter £2.1million after paying £147,000. In total, Liberty was used to shelter an average of £300million a year between 2004 and 2008. It was first investigated by the Inland Revenue 2006 and was eventually shut down in April 2008 when legislation was brought in to close the loophole. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is taking it to a tax tribunal in spring, but it is unclear whether any of the beneficiaries will be made to pay any avoided tax. Comedian Jimmy Carr was forced to apologise earlier this year after it was revealed he put his earnings into a Jersey-based avoidance scheme called K2, which cut the income tax liability of participants to as little as one per cent. The BBC, pictured in Salford, hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax. Miss Robinson has hosted BBC’s Watchdog for more than a decade, presenting herself as a crusader for ordinary consumers. She reportedly earned £6million for a two-year contract with the BBC for presenting The Weakest Link. Yesterday it emerged that the BBC hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax. The arrangements include 148 news presenters such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman. Mercury Tax Strategies, the provider of the Liberty scheme, declined to comment yesterday. Miss Robinson, Barlow, Donald and Owen all failed to respond to requests to comment. HMRC said it couldn’t comment on individual cases. A spokesman said: ‘It does sometimes take a long time for cases to be investigated. This is why we advise anyone who thinks about using a tax avoidance scheme that they should be prepared to be subject to an in-depth enquiry.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Enraged that his wife is now damned for committing suicide, Dracula desecrates his chapel and renounces God, declaring that he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness. In a fit of rage, he stabs the chapel's stone cross with his sword and drinks the blood which pours out of it. In 1897, newly qualified solicitor Jonathan Harker takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula as a client from his colleague R. M. Renfield, who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange Dracula's real estate acquisition in London, including Carfax Abbey. Jonathan meets Dracula, who discovers a picture of Harker's fiancÃ©e, Mina and believes that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be attacked and fed upon by his brides and sails to England with boxes of his native soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. His arrival is foretold by the ravings of Renfield, now an inmate in Dr Jack Seward's neighboring insane asylum. In London, Dracula emerges as a wolf-like creature amid a fierce thunderstorm and hypnotically seduces, then rapes and bites Lucy Westenra, with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania.

Peter Green, après avoir gratté chez les Bluesbreaker de John Mayall, fonde Fleetwood Mac en 1967 - la première formation, celle qui jouait du blues sous acide, pas la seconde mouture Rock FM. Sa sensibilité, sa peur de la notoriété, et ses addictions diverses, mettent à mal sa santé, et Peter Green se retire de la musique, pour fréquenter les hôpitaux psychiatriques.   Robert Johnson (1911 - 1938) le plus célèbre des pères fondateurs du Delta blues, auteur à lui tout seul de 50% du répertoire blues et dont on disait qu'il pactisât avec le diable pour jouer aussi bien de la guitare... Il est mort empoisonné par un mari jaloux, ou de la syphilis, c'est selon... L'intégrale Robert Johnson tient sur un album, ne vous en privez pas.   En 1998, Peter Green s'empare une première fois du répertoire de Johnson, avec ROBERT JOHNSON SONGBOOK, et fort de ce succès, remet ça deux ans plus tard avec d'autres titres, sur ce HOT FOOT POWDER. Le résultat est tout bonnement fantastique. Du blues pur et dur, tantôt acoustique ou électrique, mais sans aucune esbroufe, à la cool, du soft blues, avec un son live et dépouillé qui rend hommage aux originaux, tout en étant contemporain. Peter Green s'est entouré de quelques invités, parmi les lesquels Buddy Guy, Dr John, Otis Rush, Joe Louis Walker... N'en jetez plus ! La voix de Peter Green est douce, veloutée, et peut rappeler Eric Clapton sur certains morceaux comme « Malted Milk » d'ailleurs repris par Clapton sur son UNPLUGGED. « Drunken hearted man » a été repris par The Allman's Brother sur leur LIVE AT FILLMORE, et « Crossroad » reste un des plus grands classiques du genre (avec « Stormy Monday » de T Bone Walker).     Treize titres pour 42 minutes, c'est court, mais c'est sublime.   Une anecdote blues ? J'ai entendu récemment « Sweet home Chicago » chanté par Robert Jonson, et dont les paroles sont différentes de la célèbre version des Blues Brothers. Johnson chante : « Come on, baby don't you wanna go, to the land of California, Sweet home Chicago ». Johnson, qui n'a jamais quitté ou presque son Mississippi, rêve à la fois de la dorée Californie, et de la ville de Chicago déjà célèbre pour ses clubs de musique. Mais la géographie n'étant pas son fort, il associe les deux dans son texte. Les artistes qui reprennent sa chanson aujourd'hui, corrige cette (jolie) erreur, en chantant \\"down to the same old place, my sweet home, Chicago\\"...      Vous pouvez recommencer à respirer.

What is the title of this article: Thomas Davidson taught a philosophy called \\"apeirotheism\\", a \\"form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism\\" which he defined as \\"a theory of Gods infinite in number.\\" The theory was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of Soul, the rational, living aspect of a living substance which cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an essence, and nous, rational thought, reflection and understanding. Although a perennial source of controversy, Aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature, as exemplified in his theology of unmoved movers. Identifying Aristotle's God with rational thought, Davidson argued, contrary to Aristotle, that just as the soul cannot exist apart from the body, God cannot exist apart from the world.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Masami Akita (Qiu Tian  Chang Mei , Akita Masami, born December 19, 1956), better known by his stage name Merzbow (merutsubau, Merutsubau), is a Japanese noise musician. He is best known for his style of harsh, confrontational noise exemplified on his 1996 release, Pulse Demon. Since 1980, he has released over 400 recordings, and has collaborated with various artists. During the European tour in September-October 1989, Merzbow could only bring simple and portable gear; this led to the harsh noise style Merzbow became known for in the 1990s. Cloud Cock OO Grand (1990) was the first example of this new style, Merzbow's first digital recording (on DAT), and the first recording made for the CD format. It also includes live material recorded during the tour.  But when I started live in late 1980s I didn't like to use tape on stage. I like only live electronics. So, my studio works changed to more live composition style. I'm still using many tapes in studio works, but difference is I treat tapes and instruments. Before, I used tapes as overdubbing concept. But now tapes are crashing together, no static overdub. I found that style on Cloud Cock OO Grand.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, Merzbow began to be influenced by death metal and grindcore. Recordings from this time are mostly recorded at extreme volume, some mastered at levels far beyond standard (Noisembryo, Pulse Demon). In 1994, Akita acquired a vintage EMS synthesizer. From 1996, plans were made to release a \\"10 (or maybe 12)\\" CD box set on Extreme Records. In 2000, Extreme Records released the Merzbox, a fifty CD set of Merzbow records, twenty of them not previously released.  Throughout most of the 1990s, Merzbow live was a trio with Reiko A. on electronics and Bara on voice and dance. Masami Akita occasionally played drums for Hijokaidan during the early-mid 1990s.  In the early 1990s, Masami Akita composed the soundtracks to numerous kinbaku videos by Fuji Planning (Bu Er Qi Hua , Fuji Kikaku) and seppuku-themed videos by their sub-label Right Brain. Akita also directed Lost Paradise (Shi Le Yuan  Cheng Ma Fu Nu Fu Qie ri, Shitsurakuen: Jobafuku onna harakiri) for Right Brain. Some of this music was included on Music for Bondage Performance and Music for Bondage Performance 2, co-credited to Right Brain Audile. Director Ian Kerkhof would use a Merzbow track for his 1992 film La sequence des barres paralleles, and Akita composed original music for Kerhof's 1994 film The Dead Man 2: Return of the Dead Man. Kerkhof made the documentary Beyond Ultra Violence: Uneasy Listening by Merzbow in 1998. Akita also created music for Ilppo Pohjola's Asphalto (1998) and Routemaster (2000).  Since 1999, Akita has used computers in his recordings, having first acquired a Macintosh to work on art for the Merzbox. Also at this time he began referring to his home studio as \\"Bedroom, Tokyo\\". At live performances, Akita has produced noise music from either two laptop computers or combination of a laptop and analog synthesizers/guitar pedals. Reiko A. and Bara left Merzbow during this time, Reiko Azuma now has a solo career. Since 2001, Jenny Akita (nee Kawabata) started being credited for artwork on various releases.  Since 2001, Akita started utilising samples of animal sounds in various releases starting with Frog. Around 2002, Akita became a vegan, he stated how it began:  I started raising four bantams, the little ornamental chickens. With this experience as a start, I gradually started to be concerned and care about chickens and all the barn animals I used to eat without giving it a second thought before. So I started reading books and researching on the internet about Animal Rights and that triggered an awareness of \\"evil\\" that human society has done.  During this period, Akita also became a supporter of PETA which is reflected in his animal-themed releases. An example of this is Minazo Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, dedicated to an elephant seal he visited often at the zoo and Bloody Sea, a protest against Japanese whaling. He has also produced several works centered around recordings of his pet chickens (notably Animal Magnetism and Turmeric).  Also in 2002, Akita released Merzbeat, which was seen as a significant departure from his trademark abstract style in that it contains beat-oriented pieces. This has sparked some controversy among fans, though some reviewers pointed out that it sounded very similar to Aqua Necromancer (1998) which features samples of progressive rock drumming. Merzbird (2004) and Merzbuddha (2005) followed in a similar vein with sampled beats combined with Merzbow's signature harsh noise.  Starting in the mid-2000s, Masami Akita began to reintroduce junk metal and effects pedals back into his setup. By the early-2010s, he was using a large number of pedals, oscillators and tone generators, and reduced to a single laptop running granular synthesis software. In 2014, he toured without a laptop. In 2008, Akita reintroduced the drum kit, his first instrument. This can be heard on the 13 Japanese Birds series. At this time he changed the name of his home studio to Munemihouse.  Beginning in November 2009, Merzbow started releasing archival material from the 1980s and 1990s, both reissues and previously unreleased material, several of which were released on cassette. The Blossoming Noise label reissued the 1980s cassettes E-Study, Collection 004, Collection 005, Normal Music, and Flesh Metal Orgasm. The Kibbutz cassette was reissued on vinyl by Urashima. Other cassettes of unreleased material include Untitled Nov 1989, 9888A, April 1992, and Variations for Electric Fan. 2010-2013 saw the release several archival box sets; Merzbient, Merzphysics, Merzmorphosis, Lowest Music & Arts 1980-1983, and Duo.  Akita began collaborating with the Hungarian drummer Balazs Pandi in 2009, initially Pandi served as a live drummer for Merzbow. This resulted in the live albums Live at Fluc Wanne, Vienna 2010/05/18, Ducks: Live in NYC, and Katowice. Akita and Pandi then began to record studio albums collaborating with additional musicians, Cuts (2013) with the Swedish saxophone player Mats Gustafsson, Cuts of Guilt, Cuts Deeper (2015) with Gustafsson and Thurston Moore, and An Untroublesome Defencelessness with Keiji Haino (2016), all released by RareNoiseRecords. Akita, Pandi, and Gustafsson also toured together and released the live LP Live in Tabacka 13/04/12.  Merzbow also released several collaborations with industrial/noise musicians he had know since the 1980s: Spiral Right / Spiral Left with Z'EV, The Black Album with John Duncan, and a trio of releases with Maurizio Bianchi, Amniocentesi / Envoise 30 05 82 (a split with two tracks from 1982), Merzbow Meets M.B., and Amalgamelody. Gensho, the seventh collaborative releases with Boris, was released in 2016. It is a double album, one disc is by Boris and one by Merzbow, that are meant to be played at the same time.

Haplocyonoides, as an extinct genus within this family, would have had its own unique characteristics and adaptations suited to its specific environment and ecological role during its existence in the Early Miocene epoch. To infer the size of Haplocyonoides accurately, one would need to rely on fossil evidence, such as the discovery of well-preserved skeletal remains that could provide information on its body size and structure. Additionally, studying the morphology and ecology of closely related genera within the Amphicyonidae family could help provide better insights into the size and characteristics of Haplocyonoides.

Solve this instance: But following a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the 42-year-old vendor has turned to making plastic face shields for frontline medical workers instead. “I was once a patient myself and I feel like my family owes doctors a lot”, said Linh, who received hospital treatment a few years ago for a blood-related illness. “I want to make these shields to keep them healthy. If they are healthy, then they can protect us”. Last week, Vietnam began a 15-day social distancing campaign to slow the spread of the virus that has seen most non-essential businesses shut, including Linh’s stall. There have been 241 reported cases of the coronavirus in Vietnam and no reported deaths, according to the health ministry. Aggressive contact tracing and a mass quarantine programme have helped keep that tally low. When the lockdown began, Linh assembled a group of family members, friends and fellow vendors to start making the face shields. They can be worn in addition to face masks to better protect medical workers from the tiny virus-carrying droplets released by infected patients. In just a few days, Linh and her gang of volunteers made almost 1,000 face shields, she said, and distributed them to at least three nearby hospitals. Linh said she had drawn on her experience as a hat vendor to line the shields with comfortable padding. She watched media reports of doctors in the United States and consulted a friend who works as a nurse there to perfect the design, she said. The finishing touch? A sticker, with an important message to Vietnam’s medical workers: “Fight Covid-19 disease”. “Keep believing, because we are always with you”.

I sat at my office window and drank coffee, looking out on a dirty brown Saturday that smelled like rain. Somebody knocked at the door and I swiveled around to see Pete McGreggor from down the hall. \\"Busy?\\" he asked. I shook my head and he came in, closing the door behind him. He poured a cup of coffee and sat down across from me. \\"Big shakeup last night,\\" he said. \\"I just got a call to defend one of the Preacher's errand boys.\\" \\"So they finally got to him,\\" I said, remembering the furor that had raged in the newspapers a few months before. The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \\"How'd they do it?\\" \\"It's very hush-hush,\\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \\"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess. But what I gather is that the thing was pulled off from the inside, from somebody high up in the organization. But nobody knows exactly who it was that sold out.\\" \\"It'll all come clean at the trial, I suppose.\\" He nodded. \\"Sooner than that, I expect. The DA told me confidentially that they'll have everything they need by five o'clock tonight. You'll see it all on the evening news.\\" A sharp rapping came at the door and Pete stood up. \\"You've got business. I'll leave you to it.\\" \\"It's probably bill collectors,\\" I said. \\"I'll yell if they get rough.\\" He opened the door and pushed past the two policemen that were waiting outside. They were both in uniform, but I only knew one of them. That was Brady, the tall, curly headed one that looked like an Irish middleweight. His partner was dark and nondescript, sporting a Police Academy moustache. Question: If Pete was involved in the drugs business, why would he run away after the police knocked on the door? Options: - He thinks the police might mistakenly accuse him   - He feels guilty   - He doesn't like cops   - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"- not enough information In the given passage, we cannot determine with certainty why Pete would run away after the police knocked on the door if he was involved in the drugs business. We do not know Pete's specific role in the operation, his relationship with the police, or his personal feelings towards them.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.  Question: \\"What allowed the Anasazi to live in permanent shelters?\\" Answer: \\"A newly discovered river\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct. The Anasazi were able to live in permanent shelters due to their use of formal agricultural techniques like irrigation to assist their harvest, which allowed them to be less reliant on following wildlife for subsistence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau. The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. Elizabeth, as monarch of Fiji, supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth—which were contradicted by the Palace—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family. The involvement of the younger royals in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout was ridiculed and the Queen was the target of satire.

The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective--noun combination of two words, but they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases. One classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, where Romeo strings together thirteen in a row: do oxymorons have to be next to each other? Options are: (A). no; (B). yes;","output":"(A). No, oxymorons do not always have to be next to each other. An oxymoron is a rhetorical device that juxtaposes two seemingly contradictory words or concepts to create a paradoxical effect. These contrasting terms are often used to emphasize the complexity or tension within a particular situation, idea, or expression. While many oxymorons consist of an adjective-noun combination placed directly next to each other, they can also be found in phrases or sentences where the contradictory elements are separated by other words. Here are several examples of oxymorons and how they can appear in different contexts: 1. Adjective-Noun Combinations: - Bittersweet: This term combines the qualities of being both bitter and sweet at the same time, often used to describe mixed feelings or emotions. - Deafening silence: This oxymoron suggests a silence so intense that it is almost loud or overwhelming. 2. Phrases or Sentences: - \\"The more you try to forget something, the more you remember it.\\" This statement reveals an oxymoronic relationship between trying to forget and inadvertently remembering. - \\"Act natural.\\" This phrase suggests an inherent contradiction, as the act of attempting to appear natural might be seen as inherently unnatural or forced. 3. Separated by Other Words: - \\"This is an open secret.\\" Here, the words 'open' and 'secret' are contradictory, yet they are not placed directly next to each other, but still form an oxymoron. - \\"I am a deeply superficial person.\\" This quote, attributed to Andy Warhol, combines the contradictory elements of being both deep and superficial, separated by the words 'am' and 'a.' In all these examples, it is evident that oxymorons do not necessarily have to be next to each other to create a unique or paradoxical effect. They can be found in varying contexts and distances within language and literature, serving to emphasize the intricacies of human thought, emotion, or expression. Ultimately, as long as there is a sense of contradiction or paradox, an oxymoron can be considered effective, regardless of the exact positioning of the opposing terms."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! Scientists think the color of sunlight on Venus is reddish-brown.   Q: What are clouds on earth made of?   A: A:","output":"Clouds on Earth are primarily composed of water vapor. They form when the air cools down, allowing water vapor to condense into visible water droplets or ice crystals, depending on the temperature and altitude. There are various types of clouds, such as cirrus, cumulus, and stratus clouds, which create diverse formations and appearances based on factors like altitude, atmospheric pressure, and temperature. In addition to water vapor, clouds on Earth may also contain other substances, such as dust particles, salt, pollutants, and organic materials. These particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), providing a surface for water vapor to condense. As a result, the formation of clouds is dependent on the presence of CCN and atmospheric conditions that facilitate the condensation of water vapor. The properties of clouds, including their density and altitude, help regulate the Earth's climate. They play a vital role in our planet's energy balance by reflecting sunlight back into space (increasing the Earth's albedo) and trapping the radiation emitted by the Earth's surface (causing the greenhouse effect). This delicate balance helps maintain our planet's habitable temperature range for the support of life. In summary, clouds on Earth are primarily made of water vapor, accompanied by various other substances like ice crystals, dust particles, salt, pollutants, and organic material, depending on the atmospheric conditions and cloud type. They play a significant role in shaping our planet's climate and supporting life on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Un estudio realizado en 1996 por Perotti examinó los canales a través de los cuales la desigualdad puede afectar el crecimiento económico. Demostró que, de acuerdo con el planteamiento de la imperfección del mercado crediticio, la desigualdad está relacionada con un menor nivel de formación de capital humano (educación, experiencia y aprendizaje) y un mayor nivel de fecundidad, y por lo tanto, menores niveles de crecimiento. Encontró que la desigualdad está relacionada con mayores niveles de impuestos redistributivos, lo que se asocia con menores niveles de crecimiento por las reducciones en el ahorro y la inversión privados. Perotti concluyó que \\"las sociedades más igualitarias tienen menores tasas de fecundidad y mayores tasas de inversión en educación. Ambas se reflejan en mayores tasas de crecimiento.

Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake.
