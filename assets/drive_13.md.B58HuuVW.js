Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Who does the drug dealer have shot?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Lucille, a crippled man who is in a wheelchair from injuries sustained in the Gulf War, searches New Orleans for his friend Melvin so a documentary crew can follow Melvin.  They find him passed out on the street.  Melvin, an alcoholic and drug abuser, is in a downward spiral and spends most of his time partying with his friends.  His estranged ex-wife, Doreen, has filed a restraining order against him and taken sole custody of their young son, Rex.  Lucille wants Melvin to clean up and get sober, but Melvin only makes empty promises to eventually get his life together. Lucas, a science teacher at the local community college, performs regular tests on Melvin, who has telekinetic powers – the ability to move objects with his mind. Lucas can not explain this except that Melvin has a slightly different brain structure than ordinary people.  Melvin will not see a specialist despite Lucas' urging. Besides Lucas' tests, Melvin uses his powers to perform street shows for drug money.  Lucille, however, blames the local drug dealer, Nathan, of being behind violence in the neighborhood and does not like him.  This is echoed by Jimmy, a local cop. After a night of hard partying, Melvin's heart stops.  When he wakes, the doctors tell him that he was clinically dead for several minutes.  Changed by this experience, Melvin announces that he intends to become sober for the sake of Rex.  Impressed, Jimmy requests that Melvin help clean up the neighborhood.  After practicing his abilities, Melvin confronts Nathan's gang and threatens them.  Nathan has Lucille shot in retaliation.  After Lucille tells him to leave him alone, Melvin falls back into alcoholism and parties with a friend who was recently released from jail. Answer:","output":"In the given context, the drug dealer, Nathan, has Lucille shot in retaliation after Melvin confronts Nathan's gang and threatens them. This shooting incident occurs as a result of Melvin's attempt to clean up the neighborhood and become sober for the sake of his son, Rex."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hispanic women learn of breast cancer at later stages, research shows. Language, cultural barriers and lack of insurance may impede medical care. Other factors include fear of results and difficulty scheduling an appointment. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Why Hispanic Women Learn About Breast Cancer Later: Understanding the Challenges Once upon a time, in a not-so-faraway world, there were many people, just like you and me. One of the things these people often worried about was catching a nasty thing called \\"cancer.\\" Cancer could make people feel really bad, and if they didn't find out about it soon enough, it could be too late to help them get better. Unfortunately, this story is true. And for some groups of people, like a lot of Hispanic women, finding out about a type of cancer called \\"breast cancer\\" happens later than it should. Why does this happen, you ask? Well, dear little one, it is a bit more complicated than you might think. There are many reasons that make it harder for Hispanic women to learn about breast cancer early on, and we will take a journey through some of these challenges today. First, let's talk about language. For many Hispanic women, English might not be their first language – they might speak Spanish or another language instead! Imagine trying to learn about a confusing thing like cancer in a language that you don't understand perfectly. It would be like trying to read a storybook in a language you haven't learned yet! This can make it difficult for them to get the help they need to understand and deal with cancer. Next, there is a thing called \\"cultural barriers.\\" This means that some Hispanic women might have different beliefs, values, or ways of life that may make it harder for them to talk about or deal with breast cancer. For example, some cultures might believe it's not polite to talk about sensitive topics like sickness, especially if it's something as personal as breast cancer. This can make it tricky for Hispanic women to have conversations about breast cancer and get the proper care they need. Now, let's discuss another big challenge: insurance. To see a doctor and get the medical help we need, people usually need something called \\"insurance\\". Insurance is like a magic shield that helps us pay less when we are unwell and need to visit the doctor. But sometimes, Hispanic women might not have this magic shield, and this can stop them from getting the medical care they need. This is because visiting a doctor without insurance can cost a lot of money, and many people might not have enough money to pay for it. Other things that make it hard for Hispanic women to learn about breast cancer earlier are fear and difficulty in scheduling an appointment. Fear is a big, scary monster that can make us feel paralyzed! When Hispanic women find a tiny lump on their breast, which could be a sign of breast cancer, they might be so scared of the result that they decide not to see a doctor at all! Lastly, scheduling an appointment can be very challenging and could include finding transportation, taking time off work, or finding someone to take care of their children. All of these challenges can create a giant mountain to climb in order to learn about breast cancer earlier. So there you have it, dear little one. This story about Hispanic women learning about breast cancer at later stages is not a happy one, but it helps us understand their journey and the challenges they face. To help them find out about breast cancer earlier, we need to work together as a family, a community, and a world, to find better ways to overcome these challenges. From teaching people about the importance of getting checked for cancer to making sure everyone has access to healthcare and insurance, we all have a part to play, big or small, in making this story a happier one."},{"instruction":"Dialogue:  W: You two are quite different.

Question: Given the following context:  Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.  answer the following question:  What are the first names of the people that discover that Dren has a dangerously high fever?

Al-Libi death a major blow for al Qaeda Abu Yahya al-Libi is universally admired in jihadist circles and among the younger generation of al Qaeda leaders. Charismatic, intelligent, a religious scholar - and with the extra qualification of having escaped from U.S. custody in Afghanistan – his loss is \\"a cataclysmic blow\\" to al Qaeda, according to analysts who follow the group. Al-Libi was the target of a U.S. drone strike this week, a U.S. official tells CNN's Barbara Starr. A U.S. official told CNN's Pam Benson that al-Libi is dead. In recent years, al-Libi emerged as one of the terrorist network's most important clerics and propagandists, appearing in countless videos. By most accounts, he was effectively al Qaeda's deputy leader. And his Libyan nationality is important to an organization that after the elevation of Ayman al-Zawahiri as leader was vulnerable to criticism it was dominated by Egyptians. Noman Benotman, a former senior member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) who spent significant time with al-Libi in the 1990s, told CNN that his death is a \\"very serious blow\\" to al Qaeda because no one else within the group rivals his legitimacy as a religious scholar nor has the credibility in the Arab world to provide Islamic justifications for al Qaeda's global campaign of terrorism. \\"Awlaki wasn't even close,\\" said Benotman, referring to Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike in Yemen last year. Al-Libi (real name: Hasan Muhamad Qayed) was born in Marzaq in the southwest Sabha province deep inside Libya's interior. As a young man he studied chemistry for one year at Sabha University but, like many young Libyans, was swept up in an Islamic awakening hostile to the Gadhafi regime that arose in Libya in the late 1980s. As an outlet for their frustration, and a chance to participate in Holy War, al-Libi and his brother, Abd al-Wahab al-Qayed (also subsequently known as Idris), were among the many young Libyans who traveled to Afghanistan to fight jihad against the Soviet-backed government. In 1990 his brother was one of the founding members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which fought a failed campaign to overthrow the rule of Moammar Gadhafi in the mid 1990s. Benotman, who is now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation in London, first spent time with al-Libi around 1990-1991 in Afghanistan. He recalls that al-Libi was always much more interested in religious learning than fighting. \\"He was a very smart guy and hungry to learn about Sharia law,\\" Benotman told CNN. After a few years in Afghanistan, al-Libi traveled to Mauretania, where he undertook religious studies for two years under well-known scholars, according to Benotman. \\"He was the best student they had,\\" Benotman said. Benotman noticed the change in al-Libi when he returned to Afghanistan: \\"He was a real and serious Sharia student.\\" In the mid-1990s al-Libi moved to Sudan with other LIFG fighters after conditions for Arab fighters became difficult in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Separately, Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda also relocated there. Benotman said that al-Libi took no operational role in the coordination of a insurgent campaign the group began against the Gadhafi in Libya around this time. \\"He didn't have fighting skills or knowledge of military leadership,\\" Benotman told CNN. After the Taliban took over much of Afghanistan in 1996, al-Libi settled in Kabul, according to Benotman. Al-Libi's religious views leaned toward the extreme, said Benotman, but he did not subscribe to the ultra-hardline \\"takfiri\\" interpretation of Islam that argued for the permissibility of killing those regarded by some Sunnis as \\"heretical\\" Muslims - like the Shia. In late 2001, al-Libi's world was turned upside down when the United States routed the Taliban in Afghanistan. Like many Arab fighters he fled across the border to Pakistan, where he holed up in an apartment block with other militants in Karachi, according to Benotman. But a Pakistani raid in 2002 led to his arrest and he was quickly handed over to American authorities, who held him in a prison in Kandahar, according to Benotman. He was subsequently transferred to an American detention facility at Bagram air base near Kabul. It was al-Libi's escape from the prison in July 2005 that shot him to jihadist stardom. His nighttime escape was featured in a subsequent jihadist propaganda video narrated by a fellow escapee, who claimed that as American soldiers patrolled it was al-Libi who cut a wire mesh fence, allowing them to escape and eventually connect with the Taliban fighters in Kabul. Al-Libi himself appeared in the video in which he alleged the Americans were responsible for severe human rights violations, claiming that when a new prisoner arrived, he would be abused and humilated until \\"he almost loses his mind.\\" After some time in hiding in Afghanistan, al-Libi traveled to the tribal areas of Pakistan, which were increasingly becoming a new safe haven for Arab fighters and al Qaeda operatives. His views on jihad were increasingly in line with the terrorist group. In December 2006 he appeared in a video urging jihadists to learn how to make nuclear weapons. Al-Libi became one of al Qaeda's chief ideologues and propagandists, appearing in numerous recruitment videos in which he cast himself as a sheikh with the legitimacy to issue fatwas. His eloquent Arabic addresses, several of which were made to groups of fighters sitting crossed-legged outdoors in the tribal areas of Pakistan, were filmed and disseminated online, and won him a significant audience among a radical fringe of young Muslims in the Arab world. Part of al-Libi's appeal to young Muslims radicalized by the Iraq war was his uncompromising ideology. But there were limits to his radicalism. According to Benotman he was concerned about the negative fallout of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's barbaric campaign in Iraq. In 2008 al-Zawahiri cited a tract written by the Libyan to justify al Qaeda's campaign of terrorism. The tract was titled \\"Human Shields in Modern Jihad.\\" According to Jarret Brachman, an American academic who has long studied al Qaeda, al-Libi argued that al Qaeda could take on the West only if it engaged \\"in a fierce war using weapons of mass destruction\\" and that this would entail Muslim casualties. As drone strikes began to take their toll on al Qaeda in 2008, killing a number of senior leaders, al-Libi appeared to play a more hands-on military role in the organization despite his lack of combat experience. Bryant Neal Vinas, a young American from Long Island who was recruited into al Qaeda, testified in a recent court case that during the late summer of 2008 he participated in an expedition to attack a U.S. base near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border with a group of fighters under the command of al-Libi, whom he described as the \\"emir\\" of an al Qaeda outfit based in Lwara, Pakistan, near the Afghan border. Benotman said that al-Libi's military role should not be exaggerated. \\"He's not a frontline fighter or someone very capable of military strategy,\\" he told CNN. Brachman and other counterterrorism analysts came to see al-Libi as a natural successor to bin Laden because of his charisma and religious credentials. In an interview with CNN in 2009, Benotman was sceptical al-Libi would be effective in the top job: \\"He lacks the management skills of a bin Laden; the ability to see the big picture and think strategically. Hardcore Salafists don't think practically because they believe God will help them through.\\" By the second half of 2010, as more senior al Qaeda operatives were killed or captured, al-Libi was thrust into a managerial role. But within the al Qaeda hierarchy he was still junior to another Libyan within the group. Letters recovered from bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad suggest al-Libi developed a working relationship with Atiyah abd al-Rahman, who in mid-2010 took over al Qaeda's day-to-day operations in the tribal areas of Pakistan and became bin Laden's main interlocutor within the terrorist organization until al-Rahman's death in a drone strike in August 2011. Al-Rahman was known as a strategic thinker but also a pragmatist. In December 2010 he and al-Libi wrote a joint letter to Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, to scold him for the group's indiscriminate killing of Muslim civilians and use of kidnapping, which they said was hurting the jihadist cause in Pakistan. A copy of the letter was subsequently found in Abbottabad. After the death of al-Rahman, counterterrorism officials believe, al-Libi stepped into his shoes in managing the day-to-day operations of the terrorist network and its relations with affiliates. Benotman says that like al-Rahman, al-Libi had significant influence with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), al Qaeda's North African affiliate, and Al-Shabaab, the network's Somali affiliate. \\"They respect him, love him, and listen to him,\\" Benotman told CNN. His loss might therefore damage al-Zawahiri's ability to coax the affiliates into following his strategic guidance. After the onset of the Arab Spring in 2011, al-Libi took a lead role in al Qaeda's propaganda efforts to try to turn events to their advantage. Benotman said that it is here and in his justification of al Qaeda's global campaign of attacks that his loss would be most keenly felt. The Libyan cleric was able to describe the stakes arising from the Arab uprising in religious terms more effectively than any other al Qaeda leader, according to Benotman. Addressing Libyan followers in a wide-ranging video address in December 2011, al-Libi said, \\"At this crossroads you have found yourselves, you either choose a secular regime that pleases the greedy crocodiles of the West and for them to use it as a means to fulfill their goals, or you take a strong position and establish the religion of Allah.\\" With his death, it is possible there may be a backlash by pro al Qaeda forces in Libya. According to several sources, al Qaeda has developed a presence in eastern Libya, where it has recruited and trained several hundred fighters. Last month a previously unknown jihadist outfit calling itself the Imprisoned Omar Abdel Rahman Brigades claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on the Red Cross in Benghazi. Al-Libi, in a video released late last year, claimed his own death would not hurt al Qaeda's cause: \\"I say to America: Don't have hopes that you are about to defeat al Qaeda. Let al Qaeda be defeated and all their leaders and individuals be killed, and then what? The battle with America today is not with an organization or a group or a sect, but it is a battle with the Ummah of Islam,\\" meaning the global Islamic community. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Abu Yahya al-Libi, a key leader and religious scholar within al Qaeda, was killed in a US drone strike, dealing a significant blow to the organization. Al-Libi was considered al Qaeda's deputy leader and was admired in jihadist circles. He played a crucial role in providing religious justifications for the group's terrorist activities and had influence with affiliates such as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Al-Shabaab in Somalia. His death may impact al-Zawahiri's ability to guide these affiliates strategically, and it is possible that his loss may spark a backlash by pro al Qaeda forces in Libya."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instructions: We would like you to assess the QUALITY of each of the following argument (discussing Gun Control) and determine if the argument is Valid or Invalid. A valid argument is clearly interpretable and either expresses an argument, or a premise or a conclusion that can be used in an argument for the topic of gun control. An invalid argument is a phrase that cannot be interpreted as an argument or not on the topic of gun control. Input: Your attempt to use rates of BJS to prove gun deaths, which have actually gone down despite huge increases of guns, fell flat as it has remained flat or decreased while other weapons were used in 2/3rds of the crimes. Output:","output":"To assess the quality of the argument and determine its validity, let's break it down into its components: 1. The statement refers to the use of Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) as evidence. 2. It claims that gun deaths have gone down despite the increase in the number of guns. 3. It mentions that the BJS rates have remained flat or decreased. 4. It notes that other weapons were used in 2/3rds of the crimes. Now, let's analyze each component: 1. Referring to the Bureau of Justice Statistics is a valid element in a gun control discussion since it provides relevant data. 2. Claiming that gun deaths have gone down while gun ownership increased is a valid premise in the argument. It presents a potentially counterintuitive relationship between gun ownership and gun deaths. 3. Stating that the BJS rates have remained flat or decreased supports the initial premise and is valid in the context of the discussion. 4. Noting that other weapons were used in 2/3rds of the crimes, while not directly about gun control, is still valid since it provides context and proportionality to the issue. Overall, the argument can be considered valid, as it presents a clear standpoint on the topic of gun control by providing specific data and context. It raises questions on the relationship between gun ownership and gun deaths, and the relevance of other weapons in criminal activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   An experiment is a controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab. It investigates the effects of an independent variable on a dependent variable.   Q: What is a controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab?   A: Answer:","output":"A controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab is an experiment, which is a methodical, organized, and systematic process of investigation used by researchers to test a hypothesis, create new knowledge, or study the influence of certain factors on observed phenomena. This type of test adopts a highly structured approach to minimize the impact of extraneous influences and carefully controls potential confounding variables, thereby enabling accurate and reliable conclusions to be drawn from the results. In a controlled scientific test, the researcher focuses on two primary types of variables: the independent variable (IV) and the dependent variable (DV). The independent variable is the element that the researcher manipulates or alters, whereas the dependent variable is the outcome that is being studied and measured. For instance, in a study examining the effect of specific drug regimens on patient recovery times, the independent variable would be the drug regimen applied, and the dependent variable would be the time it takes for the patients to recover. Controlled scientific tests in labs generally follow these key steps: 1. Development of a hypothesis: To start the experiment, researchers formulate a testable statement, or hypothesis, that predicts a relationship between the independent and dependent variables based on prior knowledge, observations, or theoretical frameworks. 2. Experimental design: Researchers develop a robust and unbiased plan that outlines the methods, materials, and procedures necessary for conducting the experiment. This includes the identification and control of potential confounding variables, which could otherwise distort the observed outcomes. 3. Conducting the experiment: Following the designed plan, researchers execute the experiment by manipulating the independent variable, observing its effect on the dependent variable, and collecting relevant data. The researchers ensure that they maintain a controlled environment and adhere to the experiment's protocols to minimize external influences and ensure accurate, reliable results. 4. Data analysis: Upon conclusion of the experiment, researchers analyze the collected data to determine if a statistically significant relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables, using various statistical methods. 5. Interpretation and reporting: The researchers draw conclusions based on the data analysis, reflecting on whether the results support or reject the hypothesis. They also evaluate the experiment's limitations and suggest potential improvements for future studies. The findings are then reported and shared with the scientific community through journal articles, conferences, or other forms of dissemination. Conducting controlled scientific tests in a lab ensures that researchers have a controlled environment for their experiments, which allows them to eliminate or minimize the impact of external variables that might impact the results. Additionally, laboratory efficiency, access to advanced equipment, and a greater degree of repeatability make lab-based experiments a reliable method for testing hypotheses and generating new knowledge in various scientific disciplines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was puzzled by these results , and they remained unexplained until the discovery of the positron in 1931 .  - The Neva is a river in northwestern Russia flowing from Lake Ladoga through the western part of Leningrad Oblast (historical region of Ingria) to the Neva Bay of the Gulf of Finland. Despite its modest length of , it is the fourth largest river in Europe in terms of average discharge (after the Volga, the Danube and the Rhine).  - Peter the Great, Peter I or Peter Alexeyevich (  ) ruled the Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire from 7 May (O.S. 27 April) 1682 until his death, jointly ruling before 1696 with his elder half-brother, Ivan V. Through a number of successful wars he expanded the Tsardom into a much larger empire that became a major European power. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, westernized, and based on The Enlightenment. Peter's reforms made a lasting impact on Russia and many institutions of Russian government trace their origins to his reign.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow.

Question: If cells that divide uncontrollably may form masses of neoplastic origin, then cells that divide which way may form masses of neoplastic origin?  Answer choices: - non-neoplastic  - controllably  - epidermal  - an organism's body  - seldomly  - epidermis and dermis  - uncontrollably  - Veins and arteries. Answer:","output":"The correct answer is that cells that divide uncontrollably may form masses of neoplastic origin. This phenomenon refers to the abnormal cell proliferation that can lead to the formation of tumors or neoplasms. Neoplasms can be either benign or malignant, where malignant neoplasms have the potential to invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to distant sites within the body.  The process of cell division that occurs within normal cell populations is tightly regulated and follows a specific set of rules, thereby maintaining tissue and organ equilibrium. When this balance is disrupted, cells can become capable of evading the signals that ensure a balance between cell division, growth, and death. This uncontrolled growth can then result in masses of neoplastic origin.  Let's take a brief look at the other answer choices and why they aren't accurate: - Non-neoplastic: Non-neoplastic cells are those without neoplastic properties and thus do not form masses with neoplastic characteristics. - Controllably: This is the opposite of uncontrollable cell division. Controllable cell division is the normal process of cell growth and maintenance in tissues and organs, and it does not lead to neoplastic masses. - Epidermal: This term refers to the outermost layer of the skin. While cells of the epidermis may undergo uncontrolled cell division and result in neoplastic growth, the term in itself does not define the process that leads to neoplastic masses. - An organism's body: This phrase refers to the entirety of a living being and does not specifically address the type of cell division that leads to neoplastic masses. - Seldomly: A frequency-related term, \\"seldomly\\" by itself does not describe any specific process or mechanism of cell division that would result in neoplastic growth. - Epidermis and dermis: These are the two main layers of the skin, and although neoplastic growth can occur in these layers, the term does not address the process which leads to the formation of neoplastic masses. - Veins and arteries: Veins and arteries are parts of the circulatory system and do not describe the proper type of cell division that could result in masses of neoplastic origin. In conclusion, cells that divide uncontrollably are those which may form masses of neoplastic origin due to the disruption of balance between cell division, growth, and death. This uncontrolled growth can result in tumors or neoplasms, which can be either benign or malignant depending on their ability to invade surrounding tissue and metastasize throughout the body."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What key details about andrzej chrobák  can be extracted from the following bio?

Here are possible answers to this question: - underage - banned - adult - rules - black market  I believe the correct choice is \\"underage\\", here's why: A:","output":"Underage Step 1: Analyze the question The question is asking for a reason why someone is not legally allowed to buy alcohol.  Step 2: Review the possible answers and eliminate irrelevant choices - Underage - Banned - Adult - Rules - Black market First, I'll eliminate 'adult' from the list, as it implies someone being of legal age, rather than not being able to buy alcohol. Second, I'll eliminate 'rules' since it is not a specific reason, but a general term that could encompass many reasons. Third, I'll eliminate 'black market' as well because this is a context where illegal alcohol purchases could take place, but it does not directly explain why someone might not be allowed to buy alcohol. Step 3: Compare remaining choices and select the most appropriate answer We are now left with two choices: - Underage - Banned 'Banned' is a valid reason for someone not being able to buy alcohol legally, but this could be due to a number of reasons, such as having a history of alcohol abuse or being on a prohibition order. However, the most common and universally applicable reason for someone not being able to buy alcohol legally is being 'underage'. This is because most jurisdictions have explicit age restrictions on the purchase and consumption of alcohol.

The term may also include Americans of mixed-race ancestry who self-identify with just one group culturally and socially (cf. the one-drop rule). In the 2010 US census, approximately 9 million individuals, or 2.9% of the population, self-identified as multiracial. There is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number, but people live according to social and cultural identities, not DNA. Historical reasons, including slavery creating a racial caste and the European-American suppression of Native Americans, often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity, generally that of the culture in which they were raised. Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities. While many Americans may be biologically multiracial, they often do not know it or do not identify so culturally, any more than they maintain all the differing traditions of a variety of national ancestries.

A: Pick from:  (1). air pressure;  (2). air currents;  (3). ground temperature;  (4). air temperature; The answer is:","output":"The type of precipitation that falls is primarily determined by (4) air temperature, both at ground level and in the higher layers of the atmosphere.  When the air temperature throughout the atmosphere is consistently below freezing, snow is formed. This is because frozen water droplets in the clouds combine and fall to the ground as snowflakes. If the air temperature is consistently above freezing from the cloud level to the ground level, rainwater droplets will fall as liquid precipitation. However, other types of precipitation can occur if the temperature conditions in the atmosphere are varied. Freezing rain, for example, forms when rain falls through a below-freezing layer of air just above the ground and then freezes upon contact with the cold ground or other surfaces. Sleet, on the other hand, occurs when raindrops pass through a thicker freezing layer, causing them to turn into ice pellets before reaching the ground. In summary, air temperature is the main factor that determines the type of precipitation that falls, but factors such as air pressure, air currents, and ground temperature may also contribute to the process and influence the formation of different types of precipitation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the 33 1⁄3 rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2⁄3 rpm records. Subsequently, the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The 16 2/3 rpm record speed was primarily used for recordings such as books for the blind, and it also saw limited use in the automotive industry by Chrysler. However, poor performance and weak implementation led to its decline. Although some turntable models continued to have a 16 rpm speed setting until the 1970s, these records were never widely commercially available."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","output":"Monet meistä täällä eivät pidä niitä vakuuttavina. In English, the phrase \\"Many of us here do not find them convincing\\" carries the meaning that a group of people present at a particular location are not convinced by certain ideas, arguments, or assertions. The phrase can be used in various contexts, such as during a discussion, debate, or conversation where differing opinions are being expressed. In Finnish, this same sentiment can be expressed using the phrase \\"Monet meistä täällä eivät pidä niitä vakuuttavina.\\" This sentence can be broken down into its individual components as follows: 1. \\"Monet\\" translates to \\"many\\" and indicates that a substantial number of individuals do not find something convincing. 2. \\"meistä\\" is a genitive plural form of the pronoun \\"me,\\" which means \\"we\\" or \\"us.\\" It is combined with \\"monet\\" to form the phrase \\"many of us.\\" 3. \\"täällä\\" means \\"here,\\" referring to the physical location of the people involved in the conversation. 4. \\"eivät\\" is a negative auxiliary verb that negates the verb that follows. In this case, it negates the verb \\"pidä\\", which means \\"to find\\" or \\"to think\\". 5. \\"pidä\\" is a third-person plural form of the verb \\"pitää\\" and is used here in the sense of finding or considering something in a certain way. In this case, it refers to not finding something convincing. 6. \\"niitä\\" is a partitive plural form of the pronoun \\"se,\\" which means \\"it\\" or \\"that.\\" In this context, it refers to the unspecified ideas, arguments, or assertions that the group of people find unconvincing. 7. \\"vakuuttavina\\" is an adjective in the plural inessive form, which translates to \\"convincing\\" in English. It is connected to \\"niitä\\" and helps to describe what is not found convincing by the group of people. By translating the original English phrase into Finnish, the intended meaning and context are preserved, effectively conveying the message to a Finnish-speaking audience that many people in the group are not convinced by certain ideas or arguments."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: As the capital of China's Shaanxi Province, Xi'an's long history was properly summed up by our English-speaking guide: \\"If Xi'an is the grandmother of cities, Beijing is a youth and Shanghai is just a baby in the womb. \\" However, it was not until 1974, following the chance discovery of the Army of Terracotta Warriors by well-digging farmers, that Xi'an was once again pushed onto the international map. Three decades later, the local government is pouring funds into the tourism sector. Ancient monuments and museums are being restored, and various copies of Buddhist and Tang heritage are being constructed to help Chinese tourists rediscover their national heritage. One of those ancient monuments is the Big Wild Goose Pagoda-Xi'an's most sacred   monument-which was built in 652 by the monk Xuanzang ,who travelled across India for 18 years and returned with a precious collection of Buddhist sacred texts. In 1966,the Red Guards burnt the pagoda's scriptures, silk wall hangings and other relics in a bonfire that raged all night. But that destruction has largely been forgotten as tourists flock to the newly restored pagoda. The only original remainders-the empty shell of the seven-storey pagoda-light up at night, standing out in the city's skyline. Xi'an is also displaying the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty, with a 165-acre Tang Paradise Theme Park that is visited by flocks of tourist groups. Although every bit of this Tang heritage is recreated, it is artistically pleasing, landscaped with ponds and lakes, classical gardens, bridges, palaces and pavilions.

It can cause itchy eyes, as well as sore or tired eyes. You may also have blurred vision, watery eyes, or be more sensitive to bright lights. See your doctor right away if you have double vision. Prolonged eyestrain can be a sign of another issue, so if it persists, see a doctor. Eye fatigue is most often caused by staring too long at one thing, whether it be the road, a computer screen, or a book. Try to reduce your time doing these activities if you can.  Trying to read or work on a project in dim light can also cause eye strain. Add light to help reduce strain.  However, if you're working on the computer or watching television, lights that are too bright can cause problems. Adjust lighting so there isn't a glare. In order to reduce eye fatigue, you need to rest your eyes. To do this, follow the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, glance away from what you are focusing on for 20 seconds. The object you look at should be at least 20 feet away. Repeat this every 20 minutes while you are reading or using a computer or looking at one thing for a long time. If you are suffering from eye fatigue, you may have the wrong eyeglass prescription. Make an appointment with your eye doctor and explain what has been going on with your eyes. They may suggest a different prescription for your everyday glasses or possibly suggest a pair of work glasses. This may help reduce fatigue from your computer or reading distance. When you are working on a computer, you are likely to get eye fatigue. While you work, your screen should be about 2 feet (0.6 m) away from you. It should also be slightly below eye level, or where your glance would normally fall.  You should also keep your screen clean, because any dirt, dust, or smears on the surface can make your eyes strain to see through it.  Use a microfiber wipe and a screen cleaning solution to wipe down your screens. Turn off your screens before cleaning.","output":"This article is about eye fatigue, its symptoms, causes, and how to prevent and reduce it by following the 20-20-20 rule, adjusting lighting, having the right eyeglass prescription, and maintaining a clean computer screen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, the French Embassy says there are just 100 more to be given out. The Legion d'Honneur is France's highest military and civilian honour. The process has been handled jointly by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the French Embassy, which says 5,500 have been awarded in the last three years. An embassy spokesman said: \\"The French authorities attach great importance to ensuring each veteran receives their medal, and have been working hard, in coordination with the British authorities, to ensure that all of the veterans who have already sent their applications to the MoD receive their medal.\\" French Ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann said: \\"It's always a great honour to award the LÃ©gion dÂ´Honneur to British D-Day veterans. I have had the privilege of presiding over dozens of ceremonies around the country, but each one is very special. \\"Seventy-three years on, France remembers what it owes these men and women.

Horace Engdahl, a member of the Nobel Committee, described Dylan's place in literary history: ...a singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards, beside Ovid, beside the Romantic visionaries, beside the kings and queens of the blues, beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards.

Under this policy, Hong Kong was able to maintain its own legal and economic systems, separate from those of mainland China, thereby granting the territory greater autonomy and freedom for its citizens. The \\"one country, two systems\\" principle was meant to ensure that Hong Kong preserves its distinct characteristics, such as freedom of speech and assembly, as well as an independent judiciary. However, critics argue that instances like the one mentioned in the article may demonstrate Beijing's increasing influence over Hong Kong's affairs, putting the integrity of this policy into question. In the specific situation described in the article, the Hong Kong government's decision to admit Hollywood actress Mia Farrow while denying entry to Jens Galschiøt and his associates can be seen as a contradiction and potentially undermining the \\"one country, two systems\\" policy. By selectively allowing certain individuals to enter and express their views, it may indicate a double standard and could be perceived as an attempt to control the narrative surrounding sensitive issues such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and China's role in the Darfur crisis. This selective treatment could be viewed as a violation of Hong Kong's autonomy and the \\"one country, two systems\\" policy, in which such decisions should be made independently without influence from the central Chinese government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The gatherings frequently ended in physical tussles and arrests.      The women’s demands were anathema to Israel’s ultra-Orthodox religious establishment, which manages the site. The rules governing worship – set by the Western Wall rabbi, Shmuel Rabinowitz – forbade men and women from praying together. A small section of the wall is sectioned off for women.            Women of the Wall also demanded an end to ultra-orthodox bans on women praying aloud, reading from the Torah and wearing traditional prayer shawls, known as tallit.            Thousands of Jews pray every day at the site, the last remnant of the retaining wall of the Temple Mount, pushing scraps of paper bearing handwritten prayers into the cracks between the ancient stones. The site also attracts thousands of tourists and international dignitaries, with Pope Francis, Barack Obama and Madonna among global figures who have prayed at the wall.            The new section for non-Orthodox mixed gender prayer will double the size and make permanent an area designated under a temporary compromise reached in 2013 after Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu ordered a solution to be found to the dispute. The expanded area, costing £6m, will accommodate 1,200 worshippers and be officially registered in Israel’s Law of Holy Sites. It will be administered by government officials.            The Israeli cabinet approved the plan without a formal vote. Ultra-Orthodox cabinet members criticised the move, with interior minister Aryeh Deri saying: “For all the years of its existence, the state of Israel has conducted itself based on traditional Judaism.”            Facebook Twitter Pinterest Women of the Wall wearing prayer shawls sing as they walk towards the women’s section of the Western Wall. Photograph: Jim Hollander/EPA      The Israel Religious Action Centre and the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism hailed Sunday’s agreement as historic. “For decades, Israel has given full religious authority at the Kotel [the Western Wall] to Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Judaism. That is about to change,” said Rabbis Noa Sattah and Gilad Kariv in a joint statement.            They added: “This will put an end to the embarrassing spectacle of male and female soldiers and officials being segregated at government and military events, and to situations where the Kotel’s Orthodox rabbi refuses to let women light menorahs or female soldiers to sing our national anthem, Hatikvah, in public.            “This landmark decision gives expression to a fundamental truth: there is more than one way to be Jewish. There is more than one way to pray. There is more than one way to connect to Jewish traditions and identity.”      Women of the Wall spokeswoman Shira Pruce said the decision was a “revolution for women and Jewish pluralism in Israel”.            “By approving this plan, the state acknowledges women’s full equality and autonomy at the Kotel and the imperative of freedom of choice in Judaism in Israel,” she said.      Rabbi Danny Rich, chief executive of Liberal Judaism, the sister movement of Reform Judaism in Israel, said: “This is a landmark decision for Jews across the globe. It recognises that Judaism is an inclusive religion with a variety of different but valid expressions.      “Equality of gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation are central to Liberal Judaism and now at last liberal Jews can celebrate a Judaism in keeping with the modern world at our most holy site.”      The Western Wall forms part of a huge compound in the Old City, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram ash-Sharif. It is the third holiest place in Islam after Mecca and Medina, and the site of the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa mosque.      The Women of the Wall protests attracted global attention three years ago when the US comedian Sarah Silverman tweeted in response to the arrests of her sister, Susan, and niece, Hallel: “So proud of my amazing sister and niece for their ballsout civil disobedience.

The cabinet decision was hailed as “historic” by American Jewish leaders who had long chafed at the strictly Orthodox control of the site. It was also viewed as a victory for Women of the Wall, a group of Israeli and diaspora Jews that has championed the struggle against the male-dominated establishment for 27 years in a battle largely fought with prayer shawls and Torah scrolls.      For centuries, the massive, beige stones of the iconic wall in Jerusalem’s Old City have been a symbol of Jewish unity, a place of reflection and prayer. That harmony has been marred by disputes over practices and customs between the Orthodox authorities who control most religious life in Israel and the more diverse communities here and abroad.      The overwhelming majority of affiliated Jews in North America belong to the non-Orthodox Reform and Conservative streams, and their leaders said they had felt increasingly alienated from Israel. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The Israeli Government has approved a plan to create a separate area for mixed-gender praying at Jerusalem's Western Wall.

He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard...

Because we think the government should be held to at least the same standards as a publicly traded company, and because as taxpayers, we're America's shareholders, we performed an audit  of sorts of the federal books. We're not economists, but we do have common sense. We tried to get help from Congressional staffers from both parties, as well as various watchdog groups and agencies. In the end, we found that the federal government wastes nearly 1 trillion every year. That's roughly equal to the amount collected annually by the Internal Revenue Service in personal income taxes. Put another way, it's also equal to about one-third of the country's 2.9 trillion total annual budget. And reclaiming that lost trillion could help wipe out the country's annual budget deficit , improve education, and provide health insurance for those who don't have it. So how do you define \\"waste\\"?

OPTIONS: [1]. no [2]. yes","output":"The two terms under discussion, globalization and globalism, may sound similar but they are not identical in meaning. Let me elaborate on each for a better understanding of why these two questions do not ask the same thing. Globalization, in its broadest sense, refers to the growing interconnectedness and integration of countries worldwide through the exchange of goods, services, information, and ideas. It is a multi-dimensional concept that includes not only economic activities but also social, technological, cultural, political, and environmental interchange.  Economically, globalization manifests itself in the increasing cross-border movement of goods, services, technologies, and capital, facilitated by the liberalization of trade and investment. In terms of communication, globalization is reflected in the rapid spread of information and ideas due to advancements in communications technology like the internet, social media, etc.  Globalization also leads to cultural exchange and fusion across borders, bringing about a more homogeneous global culture. However, globalization has been criticized for exacerbating income inequalities, leading to cultural erosion, and contributing to environmental degradation. On the other hand, the term \\"Globalism\\" is derived from \\"globalist\\" which is generally used to refer to ideologies and attitudes in favor of global integration. It is a philosophical viewpoint that advocates for the development and advancement of global institutions, emphasizes international cooperation, and promotes the idea of a shared global destiny.  According to the proponents of globalism, problems such as climate change, poverty, global health crises, and conflicts cannot be effectively solved by one nation independently. These issues require collective effort on a global scale. Critics of globalism, however, argue that it diminishes national sovereignty and exacerbates global inequality. In a nutshell, while globalization is a factual process describing the growing interdependence of countries due to increased cross-border exchange of goods, services, and information; globalism is more of an ideology or perspective that endorses and encourages this interconnectedness. Both are related as globalism can be viewed as a driving force or product of globalization, but they address two different aspects. Therefore, the answer is [1]. No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. One seeks to define the observable phenomenon of countries growing more interconnected (globalization), while the other one is about a belief system or ideology promoting that global interconnectedness (globalism)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What general religion is Ashkenazi?\\"  Context: \\"In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A convert generally follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside Orthodox Judaism.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Ashkenazi is a term that is associated with Jews who originate from Central and Eastern Europe. The general religion of Ashkenazi Jews is Judaism, specifically following the Ashkenazi customs and traditions within the broader context of the faith. Ashkenazi practices are rooted in their own liturgy, religious texts, and rabbinical authorities. In the context provided, Ashkenazi is compared to Sephardic, which refers to Jews who have their origins in the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa, and the Middle East. Both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews practice Judaism, though they have distinct cultural and religious customs, rituals, and authorities. The quote you provided highlights the blending of these two Jewish traditions in modern times, particularly in cases of marriage and conversion between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. The religious identity of their children may be influenced by the mother's tradition, the religious authority of the converting beth din, or through family compromise.

It simply states that the Swiss People's Party proposed the said initiative and that the Swiss voters approved it by a narrow margin. A better and more detailed answer to the question would be: Some news commentators claim that the restricted immigration proposal violates several principles and values. Among these are: 1. The principle of free movement of persons: Switzerland, while not an EU member, is part of the Schengen Area and should adhere to the principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens. The restricted immigration proposal may infringe on this principle, causing concern among Swiss-EU relations. 2. Human rights and humanitarian principles: Commentators argue that the restricted immigration proposal could lead to discrimination against certain nationalities, ethnicities, or social groups. Additionally, the proposal might undermine the country's obligations to provide asylum and protection to refugees fleeing war, violence, or persecution. 3. Economic consequences: As Switzerland highly relies on foreign labor, especially skilled labor, the restricted immigration proposal might hinder the country's economic growth and competitiveness. These commentators contend that limitation on immigration can negatively impact labor market flexibility and possibly harm businesses and innovations. 4. Social cohesion and integration: The restricted immigration proposal, as some news commentators argue, may fuel xenophobia, foster divisions within society, and impair the successful integration of immigrants already living in Switzerland.

Write an article with the title: \\"Gwen Gets Into Madonna's Groove\\"","output":"Title: Gwen Gets Into Madonna's Groove Introduction A timeless icon and the queen of pop, Madonna has been influencing and inspiring artists across various genres for over four decades. Her innovative style, bold fashion choices, and constant reinvention have made her one of the most significant artists of all time. Among the musicians who've been captivated by Madonna's magic, Gwen Stefani – singer, songwriter, and lead vocalist of No Doubt – is one such artist. In this article, we'll explore how Gwen Stefani has integrated Madonna's essence into her own unique sound and style, creating a legacy of her own in the realm of music and fashion. Embracing Feminine Power and Confidence Both Madonna and Gwen Stefani have never shied away from expressing their feminine power and confidence through music and on-stage performances. Madonna exudes sexuality and fearlessness with songs like \\"Like a Virgin\\" or \\"Express Yourself,\\" and it is evident that this spirit has left an indelible mark on Stefani. As the frontwoman for No Doubt, Gwen demonstrated her strength and sass with attitude-laden songs like \\"Just a Girl,\\" which challenged societal norms for women in the 90s. Stefani's ability to combine softness with intensity is reminiscent of Madonna's multidimensional personality that has, in many ways, revolutionized pop music. Creating a Unique Style and Breaking Stereotypes When it comes to fashion, both artists are renowned for their constant reinvention and unique sense of style. While Madonna's legendary looks like the Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra or the wedding dress she wore for her \\"Like a Virgin\\" performance have made fashion history, Stefani has also established herself as a style icon. Integrating various elements from punk and street fashion to high glam, Stefani's fashion palette is diverse, showcasing her eclectic sense of style. Similar to Madonna, Gwen doesn't shy away from breaking boundaries and stereotypes. She has continually experimented with her image on and off stage, inspiring fans to embrace their creativity and individuality. Her clothing line, L.A.M.B., further displays Stefani's eclectic approach, marrying various influences such as vintage, punk, and Jamaican styles. Taking Risks and Reinvention A key characteristic that both Madonna and Gwen Stefani share is their ability to reinvent themselves while still staying true to their core. Madonna has consistently taken risks throughout her career – experimenting with different musical styles, visuals, and fashion – which has kept her at the forefront of the industry. Similarly, Stefani isn't afraid to evolve, as evident in her trajectory from her early days in No Doubt to her solo ventures and recent collaborations. Her solo debut album, \\"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\\" showcased a blend of pop, hip-hop, and electronic elements, which set her apart in the early 2000s. Stefani's successful foray into solo work proved that, like Madonna, she could adapt to changing music scenes and remain relevant without losing her distinctive appeal. Influencing a New Generation Both Madonna and Gwen Stefani have not only held their ground in the ever-changing landscape of pop culture but also managed to inspire a new generation of artists with their music and style. Madonna's endurance and ability to continuously innovate has paved the way for many aspiring singers, including Stefani, who has explicitly referenced her admiration for Madonna on numerous occasions. In turn, Stefani's fusion of punk, pop, and glamour has influenced a new generation of women in the entertainment industry who continue to embrace their unique flavors. Conclusion Gwen Stefani has truly followed in Madonna's footsteps, evolving into an icon in her own right. By incorporating Madonna's spirit of fearlessness and innovation, Stefani has remained a formidable force in the realm of music and fashion. The similarities between the two artists encompass their musical tenacity, their willingness to explore and experiment with various styles, and their commitment to staying true to themselves and the essence that makes them unique. Gwen Stefani has demonstrated that getting into Madonna's groove is a recipe for creating a legendary career that spans across multiple decades, transcends boundaries, and leaves a lasting impact on the world of music and fashion."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Stade Ernest-Wallon (usually called \\"stade des Sept Deniers\\") is a multi-purpose stadium in Toulouse, France.

Read this: Linguistic anthropology (also called anthropological linguistics) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes.

Some related fields are like friends that help linguistic anthropology to solve those mysteries. They are: 1. Sociolinguistics: This field is about how different groups of people, who might be from different places, use their language differently. 2. Pragmatics: This field is about how people use words and sentences depending on the situation they are in, like how we talk to our friends might be different from how we talk to a teacher. 3. Cognitive Linguistics: This field is about how our brain understands and uses language, like how we learn new words or how we understand jokes. 4. Semiotics: This field is about how we use signs and symbols (not just words) to communicate, like traffic signs or even emojis. 5. Discourse Analysis: This field is about how people talk when they have conversations, including how they take turns speaking and how they use words to agree or disagree. 6. Narrative Analysis: This field is about how we tell stories, like how we use words to make a story interesting or how we remember things that happened to us.

One died; the other was shot twice in the face but was expected to survive.      They were two of four officers shot Sunday in four incidents.      A San Antonio detective writing out a traffic ticket to a motorist was shot to death in his squad car late Sunday morning outside police headquarters by another driver who pulled up from behind, authorities said.      San Antonio police Chief William McManus identified the San Antonio detective killed Sunday as Benjamin Marconi, 50, a 20-year veteran of the force. At a news conference Monday evening, McManus said a 31-year-old man, Otis Tyrone McKane, was arrested without incident after the car he was driving was stopped Monday afternoon on an interstate.      McManus said earlier that he doesn’t believe the suspect has any relationship to the motorist who was pulled over initially.      Today at 1545 hrs, Otis Tryone McKane was taken in custody for the murder of SAPD Det. Benjamin Marconi. The arrest was... Posted by San Antonio Police Department on Monday, November 21, 2016      Speaking at a Monday morning press conference, McManus said investigators have “several ideas” about why the suspect may have been at the headquarters, but wouldn’t detail them.The suspect asked a desk clerk a question but left before receiving an answer, said McManus, who declined to say what the man asked. Police also released a photo of the suspect’s car, which they believe is a 2009-2015 black Mitsubishi Galant with custom rims.      McManus declined to explain why police believe the man shot Marconi, saying he didn’t want to jeopardize the ongoing investigation.      CBS San Antonio affiliate KENS-TV reports Mike Helle, president of the San Antonio Police Officers Association, knew Marconi personally. He said Marconi leaves behind two adult children.      “Ben was a great guy. People loved him, and certainly, he had an aura about him,” Helle said. “You had to go out of your way to not like him. So he’s that good of a guy.”      Police said the search for the suspect was still underway early Monday and that no arrest had been made. McManus said he doesn’t believe the suspect has any relationship to the original motorist who was pulled over, and no motive has been identified. The original motorist was questioned and released, McManus said.      McManus said he believed Marconi was slain because he was a police officer.      “I think the uniform was the target, and the first person who happened along was the person he targeted,” McManus said.      McManus called the suspect “extremely dangerous to both the police and the public” and urged anyone who sees him not to approach him, but to call police.      Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the slaying of Marconi a “horrific act of violence.” Abbott said in a statement that “attacks against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated in Texas and must be met with swift justice.”      The FBI and U.S. Marshals were helping the San Antonio Police Department in the search for the suspect, federal officials told CBS News. Abbott announced a reward of 15,000 for information leading to an arrest in the case, bringing the total reward offered in the case to 25,000.      In a statement, the Marconi family offered thanks for the “outpouring of support, prayers, and love we have received.”      “At this time, we would appreciate privacy to mourn the loss of a wonderful father, brother, grandfather, friend, and last but not least, a peace officer,” the statement read.      San Antonio officers were being instructed not to carry out traffic stops alone after the shooting, KENS reports.      In St. Louis, a police sergeant was hospitalized in critical condition but expected to survive after being shot twice in the face Sunday night in what the police chief called an “ambush.” Police reported early Monday that the suspect was later killed in a shootout with police.      CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV reports the shootout started when the suspect again shot at officers.      Police Chief Sam Dotson said the 46-year-old sergeant, a married father of three and 20-year veteran of the department, was shot twice in the face. The sergeant was released from the hospital Monday.      “Fortunately for the blessing of God the officer’s going to survive,” Dotson said during a brief news conference after the shooting. He declined to name the sergeant.      the @SLMPD Sgt. is expected to be OK; suspect died after a shootout w/ police says @ChiefSLMPD. Info on @kmov #n4tm. — Laura Hettiger (@LauraKHettiger) November 21, 2016      The sergeant was not involved in a call or a traffic stop but was sitting in traffic about 7:30 p.m. Sunday when another car pulled up alongside his marked police vehicle. The officer told police he heard at least two shots.      “This officer was driving down the road and was ambushed by an individual who pointed a gun at him from inside of his car and shot out the police officer’s window,” Dotson said.      Police reported that officers hours later pulled up behind the vehicle the suspect was riding in, driven by an unidentified woman, and that he fled on foot. Police said the man fired shots at the officers, who returned fire, killing him. No officers were shot.      KMOV reports the 19-year-old suspect had abandoned the vehicle he was driving earlier and was at some point picked up in a different car by the woman.      Police said the suspect was wanted for violent crimes and likely feared being recognized. Police tell KMOV they knew the suspect by name and believe he could be connected to several robberies and possibly a carjacking and a homicide.      KMOV reports officers uncovered a pistol at the scene with a high capacity magazine and investigators say they believe the gunman had additional magazines. Following the shooting, all officers in the city were to begin patrolling with a partner.      St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay told KMOV the sergeant was shot “without provocation.”      “He didn’t deserve this,” Slay said. “He was just doing his job, but he was targeted because he was a police officer.”      Two other police officers were also shot Sunday night, but it wasn’t clear whether the incidents were targeted attacks.      SAPD via AP      An officer with the Gladstone, Missouri, police department near Kansas City was shot, along with a suspect. A Sanibel, Florida, officer was shot in the shoulder during a traffic stop Sunday night, and was treated for his injuries and released.      Kansas City police issued a statement Monday morning saying that late Sunday night, Gladstone PD stopped a vehicle on a traffic violation. Someone ran from the vehicle, and Gladstone police chased the person on foot. Officers tried to take the suspect into custody and a struggle ensued during which the suspect produced a handgun. Shots were fired and the suspect was fatally wounded. A Gladstone PD officer was also shot, suffering non-life threatening injuries. The driver was taken into custody but was later questioned and released.      Sunday’s fatal shooting in San Antonio came less than five months after a gunman killed five officers in Dallas who were working a protest about the fatal police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001.      Ten days after the Dallas attack, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And earlier this month, two Des Moines, Iowa-area police officers were fatally shot in separate ambush-style attacks while sitting in their patrol cars.      “It’s always difficult, especially in this this day and age, where police are being targeted across the country,” McManus said.      McManus said there was no apparent link between the St. Louis and San Antonio shootings.      “I will say certainly that it’s a coincidence, but we’re not going to venture to say that it’s connected,” McManus said. ||||| Buy Photo Ambulance leaves Sanibel with deputy and someone on a gurney.

The city web site reported that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement was conducting an investigation into the shooting. ​      Early Monday morning, the FDLE arrested 49-year-old Jon Webster Hay, of 1476 Sandcastle, and charged him with attempted homicide. He was being held on no bond at the Lee County jail and was set for first appearance in Lee County court on Tuesday.      The Sanibel Causeway had been closed for a brief period after the shooting but as of 9:30 p.m. had reopened.      However, Periwinkle Way remained closed just north of Causeway Boulevard and a few miles from the shooting site.      City officials said the suspect fled on foot but Sanibel police have located the suspect in the Dunes neighborhood.      Witnesses reported an ambulance containing someone on a gurney inside with a deputy riding along leaving the island around 9:50 p.m.      Message from Sanibel Police Department regarding Sunday's shooting.

The second option \\"puzzle\\" doesn't make much sense in the context as plastic monkeys aren't typically components of a puzzle. 3. For the option \\"Thailand\\", it doesn't match the context as this is a geographical location and isn't commonly associated with a toy or a play scenario. 4. \\"Rain forest\\" is likely incorrect because although monkeys do live in rain forests, the question talks about a playroom and plastic monkeys, indicating an artificial setting as opposed to a natural one. 5. Lastly, we have \\"barrel\\". The popular toy known as \\"Barrel of Monkeys\\" matches our scenario perfectly.

A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839.

An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837.

Summarize this article: Liliana Cernecca was able to open her mouth only a couple of millimetres after one of her jaw joints fused - a rare condition called ankylosis. She is one of the youngest people to have had such surgery, which took place at King's College Hospital in London. Her family said Liliana had been \\"bouncing\\" ever since the operation and was now more confident. The problem started after an ear infection when Liliana, from south London, was 18 months old. The bone, which has a similar structure to pumice stone, became full of infection which eventually led to ankylosis - the fusing of the jaw-bone to the skull. Liliana's mother, Sonia, told the BBC: \\"Eating was difficult and messy and it was difficult brushing teeth, she'd never really known being able to take a bite from an apple, we had to just cut food up really small.\\" The right side was fused, but the left was growing normally. It meant the shape of her face was becoming progressively skewed to the right as she got older. Mr Shaun Matthews, consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at King's, said: \\"We couldn't leave her like this as things would only get worse. \\"Although she already had extremely limited mouth opening - 5mm or thereabouts - the chances are it was going to get worse to the point where she had none at all and clearly that was going to be entirely unacceptable.\\" Problems concerned with the brushing of teeth can cause life-threatening consequences as poor dental hygiene can lead to tooth infections, which can readily spread into the head and neck. The head of the jaw joint was removed during an operation so that the jaw was only held on by muscle and ligaments on the right hand side. The jaw head is expected to re-grow normally with time. Liliana was nervous about trying to move her mouth after the operation and then \\"she yawned for the first time, oh my God, it was amazing\\", her mum said. She added: \\"She was shocked and just touched her face it was just wonderful, I'm getting goosebumps thinking about it. \\"She can eat and chew and it just gets better every week, she can eat a banana now.\\" One of the biggest differences was in school where she is now more talkative and confident. Mr Matthews said the procedure was \\"pretty darn rare\\" especially in the UK. He said it was a wonderful and lovely moment when Liliana yawned for the first time, but that she may need more surgery in the future. \\"We will monitor her growth very carefully over the next several years and through puberty in particular. \\"She may well need to have further interventional surgery as she gets older, particularly once she's gone through her adolescent growth spurt, but that should be easier to correct now that her main problem has been overcome.\\"","output":"Liliana Cernecca, a young girl suffering from a rare condition called ankylosis, underwent a successful surgery at King's College Hospital in London to regain her ability to open her mouth.

The surgery involved removing the head of the jaw joint, allowing the jaw to be held only by muscle and ligaments. Liliana's jaw is expected to re-grow normally, and she has already experienced significant improvements in eating and speaking.While the surgery was rare, more procedures may be necessary as she grows, but her main problem has been addressed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer seems to be disappointed with the purchase of the Retarded Horton Heat (RHH) CD, as they had bought it based on the recommendation of other CDs purchased by RHH fans, particularly Mike Ness. They express dissatisfaction with RHH's music, stating that it lacks the soul, passion, and insight of an artist like Mike Ness. The reviewer also brings up the point that RHH tends to make fun of their subject matter and life in general. Although they mention that they have a sense of humor and can enjoy similar irreverence from other bands like Southern Culture On The Skids, they feel that RHH lacks the talent to make their music enjoyable. Lastly, they pose a question, asking others to explain the appeal of RHH, which indicates that they are unable to find the positives in the band's music themselves.

Some people liked the movie, while others didn't. It has a 50% score on Rotten Tomatoes, which means half of the people who reviewed it enjoyed it.  Some critics say the movie is annoying and that mixing a sad event like 9/11 with a cute story about a boy doesn't feel right. They also think the boy's adventure through New York City seems made up and not realistic. Roger Ebert, a famous movie reviewer, says this movie doesn't help people feel better about what happened on 9/11, like some movies do when they deal with sad events. But not everyone agrees. Some people found the movie touching and even liked it because of the performance of the main actor, Thomas Horn. They believe he was really good in the movie and made the story feel more real. Another actor, Max von Sydow, also got praise for his acting, as he played a quiet old man who showed a lot of emotions just with his face. So, some people think Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a nice movie about a boy dealing with his father's death, while others believe it doesn't handle the sad event of 9/11 in a good way. It has mixed reviews, and it's up to each person to decide if they like it or not."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I have had my No-Spill system for 15+ years now with only replacing the plastic faucet adapter once.

Filling is a snap and with the adapter its fits anywhere from your kitchen sink, to the garden house, to even the small inset threads of some bathroom faucets.

Question 2: Why are people on both sides of the political spectrum often dogmatic in their beliefs? Possible answers:  a). no.  b). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"The questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Here are detailed explanations for both questions: Question 1: To earn 10 lakhs per month in India, there are several businesses or companies you can start or invest in, based on your skills, interests, and resources. Here are a few business ideas that have the potential to generate high profits: 1. E-commerce: Launching an online business selling niche products, dropshipping, or acting as an online marketplace can be highly lucrative, especially with the rapid growth in internet penetration and smartphone usage in India. 2. Food processing: India has a vast agricultural base, and food processing industries are now in high demand to reduce wastage and increase the shelf life of products. By providing packaged foods, snacks, or other ready-to-eat items, you can tap into the growing market of consumers looking for convenience and quality. 3. Digital marketing agency: With the rise of online businesses, the demand for digital marketing services is growing. Starting a digital marketing agency that provides services such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Social Media Marketing (SMM), and Content Marketing can help you win clients that are willing to pay premium fees to grow their online presence. 4. Export-import business: India has a diverse range of unique products and goods with high demand in international markets. Starting an export-import business in handicrafts, textiles, or spices can be profitable if you can establish connections with distributors, buyers, and retailers in foreign markets. 5. Education and training: The Indian education sector has seen significant growth in recent years, and setting up a coaching institute, an online learning platform, or a vocational training center can be a profitable venture. 6. Renewable energy projects: Given the government's emphasis on renewable energy resources, investing in solar or wind projects could yield substantial long-term returns. 7. Healthcare and wellness: Establishing a diagnostic center, specialty clinics, or a wellness center with unique health offerings may be highly profitable, thanks to an increase in health awareness among Indians. Of course, all of these ideas require a solid business plan, regulatory compliance, investment in infrastructure and resources, and effective marketing strategies to achieve success in the Indian market.  Question 2: People on both sides of the political spectrum often appear dogmatic in their beliefs for various reasons: 1. Cognitive biases: People are often subject to cognitive biases like confirmation bias and groupthink. This means individuals tend to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and prefer to agree with opinions shared by members of their own group, rather than consider alternative perspectives. 2. Echo chambers: Social media and news outlets can create echo chambers, where people mainly consume information from like-minded individuals or sources, which reinforces and strengthens their existing beliefs. 3. Identity-driven politics: Political beliefs often become part of a person's identity, blurring the lines between policy discussions and personal affiliations. This results in a more dogmatic approach, as individuals may feel that conceding on a political stance reflects poorly on their core identity. 4. Fear of uncertainty: People may gravitate towards dogmatic beliefs as a way of reducing the anxiety and fear generated by uncertainty. Strongly held political beliefs can provide comfort and stability in a constantly changing world. 5. Emotional attachment: People can become emotionally attached to political beliefs, and this attachment can trigger strong emotional reactions when they encounter opposing views. These emotional reactions can then lead to a more dogmatic and unyielding stance on political issues. To foster healthy political debate and understanding, it's important for individuals to actively counteract these factors by seeking diverse information sources, engaging in constructive dialogue with those holding opposing views, and being aware of personal biases and emotions during political discussions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  Who is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels?  Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too.

The big question for voters, as they face both an economic downturn and international threats, is: who will they elect?

Furze Croft is a newly-built classical mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, and comes with 1.74 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, huge living spaces and a 1,700-bottle wine cellar. The  developers  say it 'has been designed to be a real family home', but it certainly goes far beyond what most of us are used to in our day-to-day lives. Scroll down for video. Coming in at a whopping £17.5m, Furze Croft, in Weybridge, Surrey, is a new build in a classical design. It has eight bedrooms, a private cinema and an indoor pool. The main drawing room area comes off the entrance hall and is centred around a large fireplace and has French windows which open out into the garden. The master bedroom has its own private balcony, as well as twin walk-in dressing rooms and ensuite bathrooms. It is one of six bedroom suites. The beautiful mansion has two wings and nearly two acres of landscaped gardens. Its developers say it was designed to be a 'real family home' Once you've made it through the grand gates and up the gravel driveway, complete with feature landscaped turning circle, you open the front door onto a huge double volume entrance hall, with a sweeping staircase and glass roof cupola. From the entrance hall you can reach the 18-seater dining room, plush double drawing room and the kitchen and breakfast room, which open right out onto the flagstone paved terrace and back garden through French windows. Furze Croft has also been designed for entertaining on an extra large scale. One wing contains a large VIP entertaining suite consisting of a custom-made bar and drinks lounge. Folding glass doors can be opened to merge this space with the outside terrace,which creates a space big enough to entertain 200 guests - more than most people are used to on their average weekend. The large, open entrance hall has a marble floor and opens out into the double drawing room, 18-seater dining room and kitchen and breakfast room. The bright entrance hall features a sweeping staircase and glass roof cupola, giving a suitably dramatic first impression of the house. The light-filled breakfast room is attached to the kitchen, has a breakfast bar and backs onto the huge expanse of gardens. There is an indoor swimming pool and hot tub for when it's time to relax, with space for loungers at pool-side and huge doors opening up to the garden. The house is located on East Road in St George's Hill estate, where former residents include Elton John, Tom Jones and a host of footballers including Frank Lampard and John Terry. As well as the indoor swimming pool, complete with pool-side loungers, it boats a hot tub, while the bathrooms have super-deep baths and giant power showers. Steve Glover, founding director of developers Consero London said: 'Despite its size, Furze Croft has been designed to be a real family home that pleases and impresses its occupants and visitors. We have carefully balanced its large entertaining rooms with cosy and intimate informal spaces where the family can relax and interact. Furze Croft has been designed for large-scale entertaining, with a reception area that can open up to hold more than 200 people. The kitchen is fitted out with top-of-the-range modern appliances and has a built-in island area and kitchen table, as well as French windows. When you walk through the grand gates and the entrance hall you reach the 18-seater dining room, perfect for dinner parties. 'The local housing market is lacking brand-new 21st century mansions of this quality and advanced specification. St George's Hill is one of the finest private estates outside of central London, making Furze Croft both a good turn-key investment as well an outstanding country retreat close to the capital.' The house took two years to build and is set over lower ground, ground and first floors. The developers are expecting interest from Russian and Middle Eastern millionaires. It has six bedroom suites, consisting of a master bedroom with a private terrace overlooking the gardens, twin walk-in dressing rooms and twin ensuite bathrooms. Four have walk-in dressing rooms and ensuites and the other also has an ensuite. The house's interior oozes wealth, and developers are hoping it gets snapped up by wealthy Russian or Middle Eastern buyers. There is an extra-large garage big enough for four limousines or large saloon cars, with access to the house via a side lobby. The massive walk-in dressing rooms mean you will never again have trouble digging out your favourite shirt. The top-of-the-range super-deep baths and power showers mean the spacious bathrooms are pure luxury. On the first floor of one wing there is also a two-bedroom staff apartment with self-contained kitchen and sitting room, which could alternatively serve as an annex. The other wing houses the 11-metre long, 2.1-metre deep  pool, a gym, sauna and changing/toilet facilities. Folding glass doors in the pool room can be opened onto the garden, creating a large inside-outside leisure area. When you descend to the lower ground floor you find the private cinema, complete with customised wall panelling and tiered platform flooring just like the real thing. This floor also has a wine display suite with a glass-enclosed, temperature-controlled wine room capable of holding a whopping 1,700 bottles of fine wines and spirits. The mansion has been built using some of the finest materials and craftsmen  from around the world.  Botticino Fiorito marble flooring has been used across the house, while the design theme is evident in every room. The wine cellar is big enough for an incredible 1,700 bottles, meaning this family home is not short of entertainment facilities. The house, off East Road on the prestigious St George's Hill estate, took two years to build. The trees and plants were specially imported from Tuscany. The garage can accommodate up to four limousines or large saloon cars, with direct access to the house via a side lobby, while the grounds feature trees and plants specially hand selected and imported from Tuscany. Robert Osborn, Founding Director of Consero London said: 'Furze Croft sets a new benchmark for quality and luxury in the St George's Hill housing market. It is defined by its exceptional quality; architectural integrity and fine attention to detail. The house has involved hundreds of man-hours and a team of skilled artisans providing the very best of British, French and Italian craftsmanship amongst various other countries. 'Using centuries old techniques, stone carving, guilding, marquetry and cabinetry has been combined with state-of-the-art communications, entertainment and security technology. The result is an extremely special and unique residence of outstanding value.' The exclusive St George's Hill estate is a celebrity-spotting hotspot. It has  golf and tennis clubs nearby, large water features and an abundance of manicured green spaces.

Answer the following question: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units.  John is a world traveler. Recently, he visited two countries, France and Germany. He noticed that in France they use atmosphere and Pascal as pressure units. In Germany they use torr as a pressure unit. Back in the United States, he noticed psi is used as a pressure unit. He needs to figure out how they correlate with each other.  Which county is using an SI unit, France or Germany? Answer:","output":"To determine which country is using an SI unit for pressure, let's first examine the units used in each country and their origins. In France, they use atmosphere (atm) and Pascal (Pa) as pressure units. Atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 Pa. Pascal, on the other hand, is the SI unit of pressure, named after Blaise Pascal. It is equal to one newton per square meter (1 N/m²). In Germany, they use torr as a pressure unit. As mentioned, 760 torr is equivalent to 1 atm, and 1 torr corresponds to a rise in liquid mercury by 1 mm. Torr is also referred to as \\"millimeters of mercury\\" (mmHg). However, torr is not an SI unit like Pascal. In the United States, psi (pounds per square inch) is used as a pressure unit, which is a non-SI unit as well. Now, looking at the units used in France and Germany, we can conclude that France is using an SI unit for pressure, which is Pascal (Pa). Germany uses torr, which is not an SI unit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Passage:Roth hired 19-year-old guitar virtuoso Jason Becker to replace Vai prior to recording his third solo LP, A Little Ain't Enough. A straight-ahead hard rock album produced by Bob Rock (who had just produced Metallica's self-titled album), A Little Ain't Enough achieved RIAA gold status shortly after its January 1991 release. Before starting a support tour for A Little Ain't Enough, Becker was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, rendering him unable to perform onstage. Guitarist Joe Holmes stood in for Becker during the tour. Later in 1991, Nirvana and grunge rock emerged, altering musical tastes and suddenly making Roth's brand of hard rock seem unfashionable. Roth's band fractured shortly following the tour's completion. With one exception – 1997's well-received DLR Band album, featuring guitarist John 5 and drummer Ray Luzier – until his reconciliation with Van Halen in 2006, Roth would utilize hired-hands and studio musicians on his club and amphitheater solo tours.

Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close. Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot. After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin.

Floyd and Violet Hartwig had both suffered ill health in recent years, but with their beds pushed together the couple held hands until Floyd, 90, passed away first on February 11. Five hours later he was followed by his wife Violet, 89. Floyd and Violet Hartwig from Easton, California, began dating in the 1940s while Floyd was on leave from the Navy during World War II.

The couple first met in elementary school, but didn't began dating until the 1940s while Floyd was on leave from the Navy during World War II. While Floyd was away, the love-struck youngsters kept in touch through letters. The family still has 131 of the letters Floyd and Violet wrote to each other between 1946 and 1948. On at least one occasion, Floyd wrote to Violet five times in one day. 'Hi honey, just a few lines from this lonely blue sailor of yours. Miss you darling and so in love with you. … Honey, I'll sure be glad when I get out of this. 'It sure isn't for me, though at one time I thought the Navy was pretty swell.

Then they had wandered out into the gardens, and were lounging away the morning under the spell of their magical picturesqueness. Roderick declared that he would go nowhere else; that, after the Juno, it was a profanation to look at anything but sky and trees. There was a fresco of Guercino, to which Rowland, though he had seen it on his former visit to Rome, went dutifully to pay his respects. But Roderick, though he had never seen it, declared that it could n't be worth a fig, and that he did n't care to look at ugly things. He remained stretched on his overcoat, which he had spread on the grass, while Rowland went off envying the intellectual comfort of genius, which can arrive at serene conclusions without disagreeable processes. When the latter came back, his friend was sitting with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. Rowland, in the geniality of a mood attuned to the mellow charm of a Roman villa, found a good word to say for the Guercino; but he chiefly talked of the view from the little belvedere on the roof of the casino, and how it looked like the prospect from a castle turret in a fairy tale.  1.

The best day of my life was about to happen. To that time, my only Star Wars experience had been a few HBO showings of Star Wars. I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. And boy, did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. A green-bladed lightsaber!! Wow! Since that magical day, I must have watched this movie hundreds of times. I can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. With those multiple viewings, I have of course observed that this movie - the REAL Episode III - does have its flaws. Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie, those \\"flaws\\" are more like \\"quirks\\". Millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May of 1983, I had mine.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The need for ice in a drink is an unrelated event to the process of bacterial infection and the resulting disease. Therefore, it does not have any direct or indirect impact on the steps involved in the process of bacterial infection, growth, and toxin production, nor does it affect the body's natural defenses in any way. Considering the mentioned process and the question of whether the need for ice in a drink could lead to a more severe disease, it can be concluded that this event does not have any influence on the steps of the process. To provide a more detailed evaluation, let us analyze each step of the process in the context of needing ice for a drink: 1. Bacteria enter the body: The need for ice in a drink does not increase or decrease the likelihood of bacterial entry into the body. 2. Bacteria start to divide and grow: The need for ice in a drink is not related to the growth and division of bacteria, as it has no influence on the environment inside the body. 3. The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells: The need for ice in a drink does not affect the availability of resources for other cells within the body. 4. Other cells cannot function properly: The need for ice in a drink has no impact on the functioning of other cells, as it is unrelated to the cellular processes occurring in the body. 5. We feel unwell: The need for ice in a drink can lead to a temporary discomfort if not met, but it does not influence the overall state of health in relation to a bacterial infection. 6. The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins: The need for ice in a drink does not have any influence on the production of toxins by the bacteria. 7. Toxins harm the body: The need for ice in a drink does not increase the harmful effects of the toxins produced by the bacteria. 8. The body tries to react to the toxins: The need for ice in a drink does not impact the body's ability to respond to the toxins produced by the bacteria. 9. The body's natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell: The need for ice in a drink does not affect the natural defenses of the body and their potential to cause discomfort. In light of this analysis, the supposed perturbation from needing ice for a drink is not impacting any step of the process. The event is separate and unrelated to the bacterial infection process and the body's response to the disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Although both situations involve a father teaching his daughter a skill, the difference in the activities (biking vs. skating) and the manner of teaching (holding the bike vs. holding the hand) make the two scenarios distinct. Thus, the truth of the premise does not lead to concluding the truth of the hypothesis, as they showcase different activities and teaching methods.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today.  - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament.

The label is distributed in the U.S. by RED Distribution, and in Canada by Sony Music Entertainment. It was distributed by Warner Bros. Records in the United States from 1988 to 1993.  - ( Pitch.Black.Effects ) is the fifth and final studio album by the extreme metal band Callenish Circle .  - Callenish Circle was an extreme metal band from the Netherlands. They recorded three of their albums for Metal Blade Records, and broke up in February 2007. In the early 2000s things were going well for the band. In 2002 they toured with God Dethroned, played at the Dutch version of Ozzfest and the German Party San Open Air, and opened for Dimmu Borgir. Their fourth album was released by Metal Blade in 2003; to support it they played that year's Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze festivals in Germany, and in October they were part of the Bonded By Metal Over Europe-tour, headlined by Exodus, Nuclear Assault, and Agent Steel. In 2006 they toured Mexico (cited by the band as the high point of their career), before they decided to break up in 2007.  - Wacken Open Air (W:O:A) is a summer open-air heavy metal music festival. It takes place annually in the small village of Wacken in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With 80,000 festival visitors, and including personnel a total of roughly 86,000 attendees in 2011, it attracts various kinds of metal and hard rock music fans.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was built to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle?, using the article: The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"A two-storey rounded tower was built in the early 13th century to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle.

Here are some concepts: cloud, sky, stalk What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"Certainly, here is a detailed response creating a scenario that involves the concepts of cloud, sky, and stalk in a sentence.  The term 'cloud' generally refers to a visible mass of condensed water vapor floating in the atmosphere, typically high above the ground. It’s a large collection of very tiny droplets of water or ice crystals that form on dust particles. The droplets or particles are so small, in fact, that they can float in the air. All air contains water, but near the ground, it's usually in the form of an invisible gas called water vapor. However, as you move higher in the atmosphere, temperatures drop and the water vapor starts to condense around particles of dust, forming clouds. Sky is the region of the atmosphere and outer space seen from the earth. The sky appears to be blue because air molecules scatter sunlight in all directions and blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. This particular property of the atmosphere effectively diffuses the sunlight and colors the sky in different shades during different times of the day. On the other hand, a stalk refers to the main stem of a plant, or the slender attachment of some other plant parts such as a leaf or fruit. In a broader context, stalks serve as conduits, supplying water, nutrients, and sugars between different parts of the plant.  Linking these concepts together, here is a sentence that encapsulates all three: \\"Gazing up towards the azure sky speckled with fluffy clouds, the farmer noticed how the stalks of his tall corn plants seemed to yearn for the heavens, their leaves rustling gently with the kiss of the passing breeze, engaged in a perpetual dance driven by the elements that surround them.\\" In this sentence, the sky and the cloud bring in the atmospheric elements, perhaps hinting at a forecast, an impending change in weather, or just the appreciation of a beautiful day. The stalk gives us the earthy, grounded element, bringing us back down from our skyward gaze to appreciate the result of nature’s growth and the farmer's hard work, thus combining the agrarian and the meteorological in a poetic blend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird Movie plot: The members of the Feathered Friends' Board of Birds (consisting of the Madame Chairbird, a sparrow, a turkey, a puffin, a robin, and an owl) discuss their situation about Big Bird and hope that they can find a bird family to put him with. The group's social worker Miss Finch (performed by Cheryl Wagner and voiced by Sally Kellerman) is sent to Sesame Street to find Big Bird a worthy bird family and bring him to the selected family. After leaving Sesame Street, New York City, New York, Miss Finch brings Big Bird to the fictional town of Oceanview, Illinois to live with a family of dodos. The dodos all think very poorly of non birds, even saying he should have a bird as a best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus (who is currently watching over Big Bird's nest). This causes him much distress. When Big Bird runs away from his new home and ends up on the news, Miss Finch tells Kermit the Frog that she will reclaim him. His friends back on Sesame Street also see the news and band together to find him before Miss Finch does. In a Volkswagen Beetle is the group of Gordon, Olivia, Linda, and Cookie Monster. Count von Count departs in his Countmobile. Ernie and Bert go out to search in an airplane. Grover flies as Super Grover (later falling into the Volkswagen). Maria, much to her dismay, has to ride with Oscar the Grouch, Telly Monster, and Homer Honker in Oscar's Sloppy Jalopy. They all head out across America in search for their beloved Big Bird. Oscar, however, decides to go his own route wanting to have some fun, which greatly annoys Maria and Telly. Big Bird has various adventures in his attempt to get home. First, he hitches a ride with a turkey truck driver (Waylon Jennings) who tells him not to give up trying to get to his goal. He then meets two kids named Ruthie and Floyd (Alyson Court and Benjamin Barrett) at a farm and stays with them for a while. He ends up having to leave because of Miss Finch's arrival. While out imagining his friend Mr. Snuffleupagus in a cornfield, Big Bird is spotted by Ernie and... Answer:","output":"Big Bird's friends are sad for several reasons throughout the movie \\"Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird.\\" 1. Big Bird's Relocation: Initially, Big Bird's friends feel sad because they learn that he is being relocated to live with a bird family chosen by the Feathered Friends' Board of Birds and their social worker, Miss Finch. They are concerned about how this change will affect Big Bird, as he has to leave his home and friends on Sesame Street. 2. Adapting to a new family: Big Bird struggles to adapt to his new family, the Dodos, who think poorly of non-birds and even suggest that he should have a bird best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus. This causes distress to Big Bird and his friends back on Sesame Street, who worry about his well-being and happiness in his new environment. 3. Big Bird goes missing: After running away from the Dodo family, Big Bird goes missing, and his disappearance is featured on the news. His friends from Sesame Street feel even sadder and more concerned for his safety. They fear that Miss Finch will reclaim him and take him away from Sesame Street again. 4. The search for Big Bird: Each of Big Bird's friends embarks on a journey to find him before Miss Finch does. While they are determined to bring him back, they are saddened by his absence and worry about potential dangers he may face during his adventures. 5. Big Bird's emotional struggle: Throughout the movie, Big Bird experiences various challenges and emotional turmoil, like feeling lonely without his friends from Sesame Street and having to face multiple obstacles in his attempt to return home. This creates a sense of sadness among his friends, as they empathize with his struggles. In summary, Big Bird's friends are sad due to his relocation, the challenges he experiences while adapting to his new family, his disappearance after running away, and the emotional struggles he undergoes during his journey back to Sesame Street. Their concern for his well-being and their desire to reunite with him magnify their feelings of sadness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Subscribe to our free newsletters.                  After NBC News suspended anchor Brian Williams for erroneously claiming that he was nearly shot down in a helicopter while covering the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly went on a tear. On his television show, the top-rated cable news anchor declared that the American press isn’t “half as responsible as the men who forged the nation.” He bemoaned the supposed culture of deception within the liberal media, and he proclaimed that the Williams controversy should prompt questioning of other “distortions” by left-leaning outlets. Yet for years, O’Reilly has recounted dramatic stories about his own war reporting that don’t withstand scrutiny—even claiming he acted heroically in a war zone that he apparently never set foot in.      O’Reilly has repeatedly told his audience that he was a war correspondent during the Falklands war and that he experienced combat during that 1982 conflict between the United Kingdom* and Argentina. He has often invoked this experience to emphasize that he understands war as only someone who has witnessed it could. As he once put it, “I’ve been there. That’s really what separates me from most of these other bloviators. I bloviate, but I bloviate about stuff I’ve seen. They bloviate about stuff that they haven’t.”      Fox News and O’Reilly did not respond to multiple requests for comment.      Here are instances when O’Reilly touted his time as a war correspondent during the Falklands conflict:      In his 2001 book, The No Spin Zone: Confrontations With the Powerful and Famous in America, O’Reilly stated, “You know that I am not easily shocked. I’ve reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands.”      Conservative journalist Tucker Carlson, in a 2003 book, described how O’Reilly answered a question during a Washington panel discussion about media coverage of the Afghanistan war: “Rather than simply answer the question, O’Reilly began by trying to establish his own bona fides as a war correspondent. ‘I’ve covered wars, okay? I’ve been there. The Falklands, Northern Ireland, the Middle East. I’ve almost been killed three times, okay.'”      In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O’Reilly noted, “Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash.”      In 2008, he took a shot at journalist Bill Moyers, saying, “I missed Moyers in the war zones of [the] Falkland conflict in Argentina, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland. I looked for Bill, but I didn’t see him.”      In April 2013, while discussing the Boston Marathon bombing, O’Reilly shared a heroic tale of his exploits in the Falklands war:      I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete. And the army was chasing us. I had to make a decision. And I dragged him off, you know, but at the same time, I’m looking around and trying to do my job, but I figure I had to get this guy out of there because that was more important.      Yet his own account of his time in Argentina in his 2001 book, The No Spin Zone, contains no references to O’Reilly experiencing or covering any combat during the Falklands war. In the book, which in part chronicles his troubled stint as a CBS News reporter, O’Reilly reports that he arrived in Buenos Aires soon before the Argentine junta surrendered to the British, ending the 10-week war over control of two territories far off the coast of Argentina. There is nothing in this memoir indicating that O’Reilly witnessed the fighting between British and Argentine military forces—or that he got anywhere close to the Falkland Islands, which are 300 miles off Argentina’s shore and about 1,200 miles south of Buenos Aires.      “Nobody from CBS got to the Falklands,” says Bob Schieffer. “For us, you were a thousand miles from where the fighting was. So we had some great meals.”      Given the remote location of the war zone—which included the British territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, more than 1,400 miles offshore—few reporters were able to witness and report on the combat that claimed the lives of about 900 Argentine and British troops. The government in London only allowed about 30 British journalists to accompany its military forces. As Caroline Wyatt, the BBC’s defense correspondent, recently noted, “It was a war in which a small group of correspondents and crews sailing with the Royal Navy were almost entirely dependent upon the military—not only for access to the conflict, but also for the means of reporting it back to the UK.” And Robert Fox, one of the embedded British reporters, recalled, “We were, in all, a party of about 32-34 accredited journalists, photographers, television crew members. We were all white, male, and British. There was no embedded reporter from Europe, the Commonwealth or the US (though they tried hard enough), let alone from Latin America.”      American reporters were not on the ground in this distant war zone. “Nobody got to the war zone during the Falklands war,” Susan Zirinsky, a longtime CBS News producer who helped manage the network’s coverage of the war from Buenos Aires, tells Mother Jones. She does not remember what O’Reilly did during his time in Argentina. But she notes that the military junta kept US reporters from reaching the islands: “You weren’t allowed on by the Argentinians. No CBS person got there.”      That’s how Bob Schieffer, who was CBS News’ lead correspondent covering the Falklands war, recalls it: “Nobody from CBS got to the Falklands. I came close. We’d been trying to get somebody down there. It was impossible.” He notes that NBC News reporter Robin Lloyd was the only American network correspondent to reach the islands. “I remember because I got my butt scooped on that,” Schieffer says. “He got out there and we were all trying to get there.” (Lloyd tells Mother Jones that he managed to convince the Argentine military to let him visit Port Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands, but he spent only a day there—and this was weeks before the British forces arrived and the fighting began.)      Schieffer adds, “For us, you were a thousand miles from where the fighting was. So we had some great meals.”      O’Reilly did see some action in Argentina—just not war action. He writes in The No Spin Zone that shortly after he hit Buenos Aires—where CBS News had set up a large bureau in the Sheraton hotel—thousands of Argentines took to the streets, angry at the military junta for having yielded to the Brits.      As he tells it in his book, O’Reilly, then 32 years old, raced to cover the event: “A major riot ensued and many were killed. I was right in the middle of it and nearly died of a heart attack when a soldier, standing about ten feet away, pointed his automatic weapon directly at my head.” A television cameraman was trampled, journalists were banged up, and O’Reilly and others were teargassed. “After a couple of hours of this pandemonium,” he recalls, “I managed to make it back to the Sheraton with the best news footage I have ever seen. This was major violence up close and personal, and it was an important international story.”      The rest of the book’s section on this episode is a resentful recounting of how O’Reilly was “big-footed” when CBS used his best-ever footage in a news report that featured Schieffer, not him. “I got the hell out of Argentina fast, landed in Miami, and raised a major ruckus at the CBS offices there,” O’Reilly writes. Soon he “parted company” with CBS and took an anchor/reporter job in Boston. Schieffer notes that he and other CBS reporters also covered the protest, and that per common practice, all the footage gathered that day was pooled together for the report filed by the Buenos Aires bureau.      The protest O’Reilly covered in Buenos Aires was not combat. It occurred more than a thousand miles from the war zone—after the fighting was over.      O’Reilly’s account of the protest in Buenos Aires is at odds with news reports from the time—including the report from his own bureau. The CBS Evening News that night aired about a minute of video of the protest, apparently including some of the footage that O’Reilly and his camera team had obtained. It showed angry Argentines yelling and denouncing the junta that had lost the war. The only act of violence in the spot was a man throwing a punch against the car of a Canadian news crew. On the segment, Schieffer reported, “There were arrests throughout the day. The police threatened to use tear gas at one point. Several North American television crews were jostled…An ABC camera team’s car was stoned before the crew escaped.” The CBS report said nothing about people being killed. It does not match O’Reilly’s dramatic characterization of the event in his book; the video on the broadcast did not depict “major violence up close and personal.”      Dispatches on the protest filed by reporters from the New York Times, the Miami Herald, and UPI note that thousands did take to the street, setting fires, breaking store windows, and that riot police did battle with protesters who threw rocks and sticks. They say tear gas was deployed; police clubbed people with nightsticks and fired rubber bullets; reporters were assaulted by demonstrators and by police; and a photojournalist was wounded in the legs by gunfire. But these media accounts did not report, as O’Reilly claims, that there were fatalities. The New York Times noted, “Several demonstrators were reported to have been injured, along with at least two reporters.”      During a 2009 interview with a television station in the Hamptons, O’Reilly talked about reporting on the Buenos Aires protest, which he claimed other CBS journalists were too fearful to cover: “I was out there pretty much by myself because the other CBS news correspondents were hiding in the hotel.” (“We were all out with our camera crews that day to cover the protest,” Schieffer says. “I’d been out there with a crew too.”)      O’Reilly noted that soldiers “were just gunning these people down, shooting them down in the streets” with “real bullets.” And he told of rescuing his South American cameraman, who had been trampled by the crowd: “The camera went flying. I saved the tape because it was unbelievable tape. But I dragged him off the street because he was bleeding from the ear and had hit his head on the concrete…The sound man is trying to save the camera…And then the army comes running down and the guy points the M-16. And I’m going, ‘Periodista, no dispare,’ which means, ‘Journalist, don’t shoot.’ And I said, ‘Por favor.’ Please don’t shoot…Then the guy lowered his gun and went away.”      The protest in Buenos Aires was not combat. Nor was it part of the Falklands war. It happened more than a thousand miles from the war—after the fighting was over. Yet O’Reilly has referred to his work in Argentina—and his rescue of his cameraman—as occurring in a “war zone.” And he once told a viewer who caught his show in Argentina, “Tell everybody down there I covered the Falklands war. They’ll remember.”      O’Reilly has frequently represented himself as a combat-hardened journalist—he has visited US troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and reported from those countries—and he has referred to his assignment in Argentina to bolster this impression. On his television show in 1999, O’Reilly responded to a letter from a retired Air Force colonel, who said he had flown 123 missions over Vietnam and who criticized O’Reilly for supporting military action in Kosovo, by citing his Falklands war days: “Hey, Colonel, did you ever have a hostile point an M-16 at your head from 10 yards away? That happened to me while I was covering the Falklands war.” In his 2013 book Keep It Pithy, he writes, “I’ve seen soldiers gun down unarmed civilians in Latin America.” During his radio show on January 13, 2005, he declared, “I’ve been in combat. I’ve seen it. I’ve been close to it.” When a caller questioned him about this, O’Reilly shot back: “I was in the middle of a couple of firefights in South and Central America.” O’Reilly did not specify where these firefights occurred—in The No Spin Zone, the only South America assignment he writes about is his trip to Argentina—and then he hung up on the caller.      In The No Spin Zone, O’Reilly does write vividly about an assignment that took him to El Salvador during the country’s civil war shortly after CBS News hired him as a correspondent in 1981. As O’Reilly recalls in the book, he and his crew drove for a full day to reach Morazán province, “a dangerous place,” and headed to a small village called Meanguera, where, a Salvadoran captain claimed, guerrillas had wiped out the town. “Nobody in his right mind would go into the guerilla-controlled area,” O’Reilly writes. But he did, and he notes he found a horrific scene: “The place was leveled to the ground and fires were still smoldering. But even though the carnage was obviously recent, we saw no one live or dead. There was absolutely nobody around who could tell us what happened. I quickly did a stand-up amid the rubble and we got the hell out of there.” He does not mention being in any firefight.      O’Reilly’s account of his El Salvador mission is inconsistent with the report he filed for CBS News, which aired on May 20, 1982—shortly before he was dispatched to Buenos Aires. “These days Salvadoran soldiers appear to be doing more singing than fighting,” O’Reilly said in the opening narration, pointing out that not much combat was under way in the country at that time. O’Reilly noted that the defense ministry claimed it had succeeded in “scattering the rebel forces, leaving government troops in control of most of the country.” He reported that a military helicopter had taken him and his crew on a tour of areas formerly held by the rebels. (This fact was not included in the account in The No Spin Zone.) From the air, O’Reilly and his team saw houses destroyed and dead animals “but no signs of insurgent forces.”      As part of the same 90-second story, O’Reilly reported from Meanguera, saying rebels had been driven out of the hamlet by the Salvadoran military after intense fighting. But this was not a wiped-out village of the dead. His own footage, which was recently posted by The Nation, showed residents walking about and only one or two burned-down structures. O’Reilly’s CBS report gave no indication that he had experienced any combat on this assignment in El Salvador.      When O’Reilly was excoriating Brian Williams last week for telling a war-related whopper, he said of his Fox television show, “We’ve made some mistakes in the past but very few…We take great pains to present you with information that can be verified.” And he asserted, “Reporting comes with a big responsibility, the Founding Fathers made that point very clearly. They said to us, ‘We’ll give you freedom. We’ll protect you from government intrusion. But, in return, you, the press, must be honest.'”      Research assistance: Sam Brodey ||||| Looking for news you can trust?      Subscribe to our free newsletters.                  On Thursday, Mother Jones published an article by Daniel Schulman and me documenting how Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has mischaracterized his wartime reporting experience. It noted that he has repeatedly stated that during his short stint as a CBS correspondent in the 1980s, he was in the “war zone” during the Falklands war between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982. He once claimed he had heroically rescued his cameraman in “a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands,” while being chased by army soldiers. Yet no American journalist reached the war zone in the Falkland Islands during this conflict. O’Reilly and his colleagues covered the war from Buenos Aires, which was 1,200 miles from the fighting.      O’Reilly responded to the story by launching a slew of personal invective. He did not respond to the details of the story. Instead, he called me a “liar,” a “left-wing assassin,” and a “despicable guttersnipe.” He said that I deserve “to be in the kill zone.” (You can read one of my responses here.) And in his show-opening “Talking Points memo” monologue on Friday evening, he continued the name-calling.      In a way, it’s impossible to win a debate with O’Reilly because he is not bound by reality. In response to the article, he told Fox News’ media reporter, Howard Kurtz, “Nobody was on the Falklands and I never said I was on the island, ever.” Yet our article included video of O’Reilly saying in 2013, “I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete. And the army was chasing us.” Note the words “war zone” and “in the Falklands.”      Part of our article examined his depiction of a protest in Buenos Aires after the Argentine junta surrendered to the British. O’Reilly covered that event, and in a 2001 book, he wrote, “A major riot ensued and many were killed.” He has called it a “combat situation.” In a 2009 interview, he recalled how soldiers “were just gunning these people down, shooting them down in the streets” with “real bullets.” Yet no media reports of the event that we found referred to such dramatic violence or any fatalities. Not even the CBS News report on the protest that O’Reilly contributed to mentioned soldiers shooting and killing civilians. Erik Wemple, a media critic at the Washington Post, has examined this part of our article in detail. He, too, found that there were no news reports matching O’Reilly’s description—and that this was not “combat.” He concluded that this “appears to be a a Brian Williams-level embellishment.” (Wemple is married to a Mother Jones reporter. You can watch this Washington Post video and decide if his assessment is fair.)      Another part of the story concerned O’Reilly’s portrayal of a reporting assignment he had in El Salvador in 1982. In a book, he described a harrowing trip to a village that “was leveled to the ground and fires were still smoldering. But even though the carnage was obviously recent, we saw no one live or dead. There was absolutely nobody around who could tell us what happened. I quickly did a stand-up amid the rubble and we got the hell out of there.” Yet the 1982 news broadcast he filed and that aired on the CBS Evening News showed residents walking about this hamlet and only one or two burned-down structures.      But now O’Reilly continues to insist that he has not embellished or mischaracterized anything—and that he is the victim of a smear campaign. So let’s turn to his “Talking Points memo” monologue, as published on the Fox News site, with my responses in italics. ||||| Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly used his talk show on Friday to address a controversy over his war reporting record, calling a Mother Jones article on the subject a “political hit job.”      The article by David Corn and Daniel Schulman is headlined “Bill O’Reilly Has His Own Brian Williams Problem,” and accuses the Fox News television host of greatly inflating his experiences covering the Falklands War in 1982 as well as reporting on... ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has been accused of greatly inflating his experiences, including his time as a war correspondent, in much the same way as disgraced anchor Brian Williams.

Your job is to predict the position and missing part of the story and return in the following format: position, missing part. The missing part is a sentence that completes the story, and the position is the number of the missing sentence in the new story. Sentence1: Yvonne had always been overweight. Sentence2: She began jogging everyday. Sentence3: In two months she had lost 23 pounds. Sentence4: Yvonne was proud of herself.","output":"First, let's analyze the given sentences and find a meaningful flow between them. 1. Yvonne had always been overweight. 2. She began jogging everyday. 3. In two months she had lost 23 pounds. 4. Yvonne was proud of herself. From the given sentences, we can observe that there might be a missing sentence between Sentence1 and Sentence2, describing the reason or motivation for Yvonne starting to jog every day. So the position of the missing part should be 2. Here's a possible missing sentence: Missing part: Yvonne decided to take control of her life and start a fitness journey. Now the whole story flows logically: 1. Yvonne had always been overweight. 2. Yvonne decided to take control of her life and start a fitness journey. 3. She began jogging everyday. 4. In two months she had lost 23 pounds. 5. Yvonne was proud of herself. Output: 2, Yvonne decided to take control of her life and start a fitness journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Red fishery and Brown fishery were both fishing for Patagonian toothfish. Red fishery was fishing illegally, while Brown fishery was regulated and lawful.  Hint: Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality. Answer:","output":"Red fishery did more unreported fishing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of \\"his or her\\" indicates that the gender of the rider is unknown, but that information is not necessary to determine the location of the bike ride. 3. \\"Next to an outdoor fountain\\": This portion of the statement describes the location of the rider and his or her bike. Specifically, they are positioned near an outdoor fountain. Now, let's examine the statement we wish to conclude, \\"The rider in the red shirt is riding his bike outdoors.\\" The main factors to consider in supporting this conclusion are the subject (the rider in the red shirt) and the location (outdoors). Both statements refer to the same subject: the rider in a red shirt who is riding a bike. Additionally, the location provided in the original statement is outdoors (next to an outdoor fountain). Fountains are typically located in public spaces like parks, courtyards, or plazas, which are open-air environments. Given that detail, it is reasonable to deduce that the rider in the red shirt is indeed riding his or her bike outdoors. Thus, based on the information available, we can assert that \\"The rider in the red shirt is riding his bike outdoors\\" is a valid conclusion from the original statement."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? When you first create your new Prezi, you will be asked to choose a template. The template of your Prezi defines how the text, colors and objects will all interact on the landscape. You can pick between 2D and 3D template. 2D themes are flat and the camera moves across the canvas. 3D themes allow you to zoom in and out of the background.  Think of the template as a metaphor for what you are presenting. For example, if you are talking about surmounting obstacles to get where you are, choose the template of the mountain climbers. Avoid changing your theme after setting up your Prezi. The changes will push all of your text and objects out-of-whack. Pick a theme in the beginning and stick with it. You can turn a 2D background into a 3D one by right-clicking on a 2D theme and selecting “Change background”. Click on the Edit button next to the 3D option and you will be able to add up to 3 images that can be zoomed between. You can use the same “Change background” option to open the Theme Wizard, which will allow you to adjust the colors of the elements in your Prezi. Be sure to begin with the main points of your presentation. These will be the centerpieces of each section. You can add text, images, and other objects anywhere on the canvas. Continue to refer to your plan as you begin laying out the Prezi on the screen. To add text, simply double click anywhere in your Prezi. This will create a text box and you can begin typing or copy text from the clipboard.

This means that lower quality images that look good as a part of a webpage will look grainy when they are scaled up to fit the screen. If you leave a fair amount of white space around your objects, Prezi will be able to easily focus on them when the camera zooms in. This will help make the text or image stand out to the audience. If you want to surprise the audience with a fact or image, make it very small. This will make it illegible until the object is in focus. If the text is small enough, the audience won’t even see it coming. Frames come in two forms in Prezi: visible and invisible. Visible frames highlight the object on the screen, and include a circle, brackets, and a filled oblong shape. Invisible frames allow you to define objects and sets of objects as the focus. Both types of frames will let you control how much zoom and object receives. Invisible frames also allow you to create clickable sections of your presentation that can link to other parts of the Prezi or to the web. This is perfect for interactive presentations.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/0/0d/Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you have a paragraph of text in one frame, and want to highlight a key segment of it, create a frame around the text that you want to highlight. Create a path to it, and the camera will zoom in on just the framed text. This is useful for noting key figures or powerful phrases in a block of text. Prezi doesn’t use font sizes, which can make it difficult to get headings and paragraphs to feel uniform. In order to match size, select the text that you need to resize. As you move the mouse to change the size of the text, look at the text that you are trying to match it to. Once the two are the same, the text that you haven't selected will become darker, signifying that the two are the same size.  You can use this same procedure for matching the size of pictures and other objects.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  You can see when sections are aligned when a dotted blue line appears between the two.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/e/e1/Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} A good Prezi will be able to be understood when the presentation is zoomed all the way out. This means that your key points should be large enough to be read when the camera is pulled back. They should also be aligned in a way that makes logical sense. You can return to the overview by creating an invisible frame around the entire project. Link to this frame when you want to pull back and show the whole project. This is especially useful when transitioning between major points.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/9/9a/Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/aid637612-v4-728px-Use-Prezi-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} If you are using specific styles of frames to highlight your important ideas, stick to using those throughout your entire presentation. The same goes for colored text and other stylistic objects. A sense of design unity throughout the presentation will leave a stronger lasting impression and convey information more clearly.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Venus Context: The plot concerns Maurice Russell, an elderly actor who finds himself increasingly attracted to his friend Ian's grand-niece Jessie while simultaneously finding himself in deteriorating health due to prostate cancer. Maurice's friend describes the grand-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego VelÃ¡zquez. Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as \\"yodelling\\") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname \\"Venus\\". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have.

Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Indicate your selected choices in order, i.e., as 'ab'/'bc'/'ac' and not as 'ba'/'ca'/'cb'. If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense. Q: Title: I have not been to a deli in Boston since 1980. The clientele was heavily Jewish. I was disappointed. Choices: a. She said yes and went with George to his Prom. b. The food was good, but skimpy. c. For my birthday we went to Reuben's Deli in Brookline. A:","output":"Part #1: Determine the story's theme from the title and initial sentences. Usage: The given title \\"I have not been to a deli in Boston since 1980\\" and the sentences \\"The clientele was heavily Jewish\\" and \\"I was disappointed\\" show that the story is about a disappointing experience at a deli in Boston. In this instance, the theme focuses on the narrator's memory of an unpleasant experience at a deli. Part #2: Eliminate options that don't fit the story's theme. Usage: From the provided choices (a, b, and c), choice \\"a. She said yes and went with George to his Prom\\" does not fit the theme. This is because the choice is focused on a prom and not related to the story's theme of a deli experience. Thus, this option can be discarded. Part #3: Review remaining options and assess their suitability in the story. Usage: The remaining choices \\"b. The food was good, but skimpy\\" and \\"c. For my birthday we went to Reuben's Deli in Brookline\\" both fit the theme of the story, as they address different aspects of a deli experience. Part #4: Determine the most plausible combination of remaining options. Usage: While both \\"b\\" and \\"c\\" options fit the story's theme, the order \\"bc\\" works best. \\"c. For my birthday we went to Reuben's Deli in Brookline\\" provides context to the deli visit, and \\"b. The food was good, but skimpy\\" explains the disappointment mentioned in the initial sentence. So, the most plausible answer is \\"bc\\", as this combination makes more sense in the story's context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows","output":"To determine the sentiment of the given movie review sentence, we will break it down into parts and analyze each part individually. 1. The sentence compares two movie genres - romantic comedy and Dogme 95 filmmaking. 2. The sentence says they \\"may seem odd bedfellows.\\" Since the sentiment of a sentence refers to the emotional tone, we'll analyze each part accordingly: 1. The reviewer uses neutral terms to mention the two genres; there's no strong emotion like excitement or dislike associated with them. 2. By saying the genres \\"may seem odd bedfellows,\\" the reviewer is expressing a slight surprise or curiosity as to how they mix, but it's not a strongly negative or positive statement. Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the sentence can be categorized as mildly neutral or slightly leaning towards a curious tone. The reviewer isn't clearly expressing either positive or negative emotions but seems to be drawing attention to the combination of the genres."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well. His three new friends secure him free lodging by threatening landlord Bernajou (Murray Kinnell) with an imaginary law and find him a servant named Planchet (John Qualen).

Background: Mulvaney was born in Alexandria, Virginia, to Michael \\"Mike\\" and Kathleen \\"Kathy\\" Mulvaney, a teacher, and grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father became a prominent homebuilder, before moving to Indian Land, South Carolina. His grandparents were originally from County Mayo, Ireland. He attended Charlotte Catholic High School and then Georgetown University, where he majored in international economics, commerce and finance. At Georgetown, he was an Honors Scholar, the highest level of academic achievement awarded to members of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, and ultimately graduated with honors in 1989. Context: While promoting the Trump administration's budget proposal in March 2017, Mulvaney stated that, as to taxpayers, the government was \\"not gonna ask you for your hard-earned money, anymore... unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function.\\" For instance, Mulvaney justified cuts to block grants that go towards spending on Meals on Wheels because it was \\"just not showing any results.\\" Others disagreed with Mulvaney's statement, citing research that has \\"found home-delivered meal programs to significantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intakes, and reduce food insecurity and nutritional risk among participants. Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities, improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life.\\"  On May 22, 2017, Mulvaney presented President Trump's 4.1 trillion 2018 United States federal budget. The budget included cuts to the United States Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the social safety net and increases in funding for defense spending and paid family leave. The \\"America First\\" budget included a 10.6% decrease in domestic program spending and a 10% increase in military spending, in addition to 1.6 billion for a border wall. The budget would remove 272 billion from welfare programs, including 272 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. The budget would also remove 800 billion from Medicaid, and 72 billion from Social Security disability benefits, while removing nothing from Social Security retirement or Medicare benefits. Mulvaney projected the budget will not add to the federal deficit because future tax cuts will lead to 3% GDP growth. He described the budget as \\"the first time in a long time that an administration has written a budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the taxes.\\"  In December 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation forecasted that with dynamic scoring the 1.5 trillion reduction in revenues will increase the federal deficit by 1 trillion. Regulatory implementation of the tax cuts have been delayed by a dispute between Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin regarding the involvement of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  In February 2018, Mulvaney released the President's 4.4 trillion 2019 United States federal budget, which would add 984 billion to the federal deficit that year, and 7 trillion over the next 10 years. Later that month, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which allowed yearly federal deficits to reach 1 trillion. In March 2018, Congress ultimately passed the 1.3 trillion Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which funded the government's operations until the end of the fiscal year in September. Question: did the budget pass. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, the budget did pass. The 1.3 trillion Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 was passed by Congress and it funded the government's operations until the end of the fiscal year in September.

It allowed for yearly federal deficits to reach 1 trillion and added 984 billion to the federal deficit for that year, with an estimated increase of 7 trillion over the next 10 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Difficulty in using the product: The reviewer mentions that the product was \\"impossible to use,\\" indicating that they faced significant challenges when trying to use it. This statement conveys frustration and disappointment. 2. Mismatch between the product and the reviewer's needs: The statement \\"and not what I needed\\" highlights that the product did not meet the expectations or requirements of the reviewer, adding to their negative experience. 3. Financial dissatisfaction: The mention of a \\"20% restocking fee\\" suggests that the reviewer was unhappy about the additional cost incurred when returning the product. Moreover, the phrase \\"talk about salt in the wound\\" emphasizes the feeling of insult or injury they experienced from this fee. 4.

Rose was born April 14, 1941, in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of four children born to Harry Francis \\"Pete\\" and LaVerne Rose. He was a member of the Order of DeMolay as a young boy and was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports. He played baseball and football at Western Hills High School. Although Rose was small for his age, he earned the starting running back position on his freshman football team. On April 23, 1964, Rose reached first base on an error in the top of the ninth inning of a scoreless game in Colt Stadium and scored on another error. The Colt .45s lost the game in the bottom of the ninth inning and Ken Johnson became the first pitcher to lose a complete game no-hitter. Rose slumped late in the season and was benched; he finished with a .269 average. In order to improve his batting, Rose played in the Venezuelan Winter League with Leones del Caracas team during 1964-1965 season. Rose came back in 1965, leading the league in hits (209) and at-bats (670), and finishing sixth in NL MVP balloting. It was the first of his ten seasons with 200-plus hits, and his .312 batting average was the first of nine consecutive .300 seasons. He hit a career-high 16 home runs in 1966, then switched positions from second base to right field the following year.  In 1968, Rose started the season with a 22-game hitting streak, missed three weeks (including the All-Star Game) with a broken thumb, then had a 19-game hit streak late in the season. He had to finish the season 6-for-9 to beat out Matty Alou and win the first of two close NL batting-title races with a .335 average. He finished second to St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson for the NL MVP award, earning six first place votes.  Rose had his best offensive season in 1969 (the year of the Miracle Mets), when he set a career-high in batting (.348) and tied his career-best 16 homers. As the Reds' leadoff man, he was the team's catalyst, rapping 218 hits, walking 88 times and pacing the league in runs with 120. He hit 33 doubles and 11 triples, drove in 82 runs, slugged .512 (by far the highest mark of his long career), and had a .432 OBP (also a career best). Rose and Roberto Clemente were tied for the batting title going into the final game; Rose bunted for a base hit in his last at-bat of the season to beat out Clemente (.345).

Supergrass were an English rock band, formed in 1993 in Oxford. The band consisted of brothers Gaz (guitar and lead vocals) and Rob Coombes (keyboards and backing vocals), Mick Quinn (bass and backing vocals) and Danny Goffey (drums and backing vocals). Originally a 3-piece, Gaz's brother Rob Coombes officially joined the band in 2002. The band signed to Parlophone records in 1994 and produced I Should Coco (1995), the biggest selling debut album for the label since the Beatles' Please In mid-1994, Supergrass issued their debut single \\"Caught by the Fuzz\\" on the small independent local label Backbeat Records. The song recounts lead singer and guitarist Gaz Coombes's experience of being arrested by the police for possession of cannabis. The limited release of vinyl copies sold out quickly, thanks in part to support from John Peel on his Radio One show. The Parlophone label signed the band and re-released the single in the autumn of the same year. It achieved the rare feat of both NME and Melody Maker \\"Single Of The Week\\" status in the same week.  \\"Mansize Rooster\\", released in February 1995, peaked at number 20 in the UK Singles Chart and \\"Lenny\\" was the band's first top 10 single. \\"Lenny\\" was followed soon afterwards by the band's debut album, I Should Coco (May 1995), which entered the UK Albums Chart at number one. It achieved half a million sales in the UK and over a million worldwide. NME reviewer Steve Sutherland gave the album a nine out of ten rating, writing, \\"These freaks shall inherit the earth.\\" The album's fourth single, the double A-side release \\"Alright\\"/\\"Time\\", stayed in the UK Top Three for a month, peaking at number two.  Supergrass followed I Should Coco with 18 months of heavy touring, appearing at festivals such as Scotland's T In The Park and the Glastonbury Festival. After Performing at Rio's Hollywood Rock Festival in April 1996, Supergrass met the train robber Ronnie Biggs, and apparently said to him, \\"I was frightened for my life when I heard there was a supergrass in the area.\\" A photograph of Ronnie Biggs and Gaz together was subsequently included in the music video for their 1996 single \\"Going Out\\". Recorded at Great Linford Manor the single peaked at number five in the UK charts, but was the last song produced by Sam Williams. Supergrass returned to Sawmills Studio to co-produce follow up album, In It For The Money (released April 1997), with John Cornfield. The album was a huge success and went platinum in the UK, but confused some fans expecting something similar to I Should Coco. The single, \\"Richard III\\", reached number two. Subsequent releases, \\"Sun Hits the Sky\\" and \\"Late In The Day\\", reached numbers 10 and 18 respectively.  Around this time Supergrass also appeared on the front cover of The Big Issue, interviewed for the magazine at Heathrow Airport by ex-drug smuggler Howard Marks.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.

Her voice resonates around the chamber, filling it with an ethereal echo, and I sense that she is not an ordinary human. \\"You have been granted access to the realm of dreams, where memories, desires, and secrets intermingle with the delicate threads of time.\\" Puzzled and fascinated, I follow her through the labyrinthine expanse of the room.

You'll see it has a small brush or wand attached to the cap. 5. Gently pull the wand out of the tube, so you have some lip gloss on it. If there's too much, wipe off the extra on the edge of the tube. 6. Now, let's start with your bottom lip. Make a little \\"O\\" shape with your mouth. It should look like you're trying to whistle a tune. 7. Use the wand to carefully spread the lip gloss on your bottom lip. Move the wand from one corner of your mouth to the other, covering the lip evenly. 8. Press your lips together gently, like a little butterfly, so that some of the lip gloss transfers to your top lip. 9. Use the wand again to spread more lip gloss on your top lip. Make sure to cover it evenly, just like you did with the bottom lip. 10. Finally, press your lips together one more time to make sure the lip gloss is even on both lips. 11.

Summarize: If you're grappling with change of (or to find) faith in something, or seeking to name and use a faith that you feel, but have trouble voicing -- it can be stimulating and uplifting to join a group or congregation in that arena. Acknowledging a higher power in an organized setting offers many people satisfaction, relief and strength. If you think you might be one of them, but weren't raised in a religious kind of faith, spending some time exploring different denominations and faiths, learning about their belief-systems and finding what speaks to you the most exercises your power of choice.  If you were raised in a church, but are feeling dissatisfied, you might be in a crisis of faith. Do you use the doubt or question you're experiencing to reforge (with sparks flying) your beliefs? Or to find faith elsewhere? Each person will need to answer this question for oneself, but exploring other options is always a smart way to go about answering it. If you're unsatisfied in one congregation, try another. If your religion is giving you more questions and conceptual irritants than answers, start reading up on your or another way of believing. Have faith that you'll find (receive) the right answer. Buddhists have faith in the Noble Eightfold Path, which is a method of living in moderation as a way of ending human suffering by eliminating clinging desires. Faith in Buddhism derives from the pali word saddhā, which often refers to a sense of conviction.

Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical drama film depicting the murder of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.  According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\".  Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"One interesting aspect from the article is the motivation behind the film's writer and director, Jarrett Schaefer: \\"Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D.

Input: Robert Stack never really got over losing a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in \\"Written on the Wind\\" to Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in \\"Lust for Life.\\" Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. He has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who's in love with Mitch. Their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films, including \\"Imitation of Life,\\" \\"All that Heaven Allows,\\" \\"Magnificent Obsession,\\" and many others.Make no mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. There's one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase. We're led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy that pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch. Mitch wants nothing to do with her. He's so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was.Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up Kyle's messes for his entire life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players.In Sirk's hands, \\"Written on the Wind\\" is an effective film, and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of movie, and though he had many imitators, he never had an equal. Output:","output":"The given review is highly descriptive, offers insights into character arcs, discusses the plot, and speaks fondly of the director, Douglas Sirk, implying high regard for the movie. Despite the reviewer recognizing that this movie is a potboiler, they highlight the effective direction of the film and mention that the director 'never had an equal.'

Defense attorneys suggested that investigators guided alleged victims on what to say so their stories would be consistent. Article:","output":"Title: A Day in Court: Jerry Sandusky's Defense Team Fights Back It was a whirlwind day in court for Jerry Sandusky and his defense team. The former Penn State football coach, who has been charged with multiple counts of child sexual abuse, faced a variety of competing testimonies. Perhaps the most significant was from his wife, Dottie Sandusky, who vehemently denied the allegations against her husband. In addition, a psychologist provided a diagnosis that could potentially explain some of the more bizarre aspects of this already complex case. Lastly, the defense attorneys cast doubt on the validity of the accusers' testimonies. To begin with, Dottie Sandusky took the stand to defend her husband. According to the Associated Press, she refuted claims that her husband had ever engaged in inappropriate contact with young boys who had spent the night at their house. Contrary to some reports, she also asserted that there was no soundproof room in their basement where nefarious activities could take place. Her testimony contradicted one specific accuser's account of an incident where Jerry Sandusky allegedly tried to molest him in a hotel hallway; confronted by Dottie, the accuser claimed that her timely arrival interrupted the abuse. However, Mrs. Sandusky insisted that she saw no such altercation, stating, \\"They were just standing … in a hallway kind of thing … they had their clothes on; they were fully clothed.\\" In another turn of events, a psychologist told the court that he had diagnosed Sandusky with \\"a histrionic personality disorder,\\" as reported by Reuters. Sufferers of this disorder tend to crave attention and behave inappropriately. According to the psychologist, this diagnosis might serve as an explanation for the \\"creepy\\" letters one accuser received from Sandusky. Furthermore, the psychologist stated that Sandusky's memoir, Touched: The Jerry Sandusky Story, \\"absolutely confirmed my diagnosis.\\" While it remains to be seen how much weight the court will place on this diagnosis, it is interesting to consider how it might affect the perception of Sandusky's actions. Lastly, Sandusky's defense attorneys posed a provocative question: were investigators coaching alleged victims on what to say, thereby ensuring that their narratives remained consistent? This accusation, if substantiated, could threaten the credibility of the claims made by those accusing Sandusky of child sexual abuse. It is entirely possible that some inconsistencies were smoothed over to strengthen the case against the former coach. In a trial as tumultuous and emotionally charged as this one, it is crucial to keep a watchful eye on the truth. In conclusion, it was a busy day for Jerry Sandusky's defense team, with the key testimonies of his wife and a psychologist and the suggestion of witness coaching complicating the trial. As the court attempts to make sense of these conflicting accounts and wrestles with the implications of the histrionic personality disorder diagnosis, it becomes clear that the truth in this case might be more complex than initially believed. In a trial where lives hang in the balance, due process and a commitment to uncovering the truth are more important than ever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

BUSTED      New York City police have decided that a couple arrested for possession of weapons and explosives don’t appear to be terrorists, just privileged kids with drug habits. By Michael Daly and Lizzie Crocker      The very pregnant rich kid and her Harvard-educated boyfriend arrested on December 29 in New York’s Greenwich Village for possession of explosives and weapons do not appear to be terrorists after all, police say.      facebook Morgan Gliedman      Investigators say they believe 27-year-old Morgan Gliedman and 31-year-old Aaron Greene are just two more products of privilege squandering their advantages on drugs.      “It looks like they’re junkies,” a high-level police source says. “Well-to-do junkies, not terrorists.”      Indeed, in the first days of the investigation police reached the tentative conclusion that the explosives and weapons were just part of a drug-fueled, twisted sense of what constitutes cool.      Cops discovered the weapons cache when they executed a search warrant at the couple’s W. 9th Street apartment at 6 a.m. Saturday, acting on a credit-card fraud charge against Gliedman. What they found initially suggested that Gliedman and Greene might be throwbacks to the rich-kid Weatherman radicals who had blown themselves up just two blocks uptown back in 1970.      The added twist was Gliedman’s pregnancy. Not even the most radical radicals of yore had resided amidst explosives while in the ninth month.      Gliedman’s arrest date apparently coincided with her due date and she was taken to a hospital on Saturday while her prospective baby daddy was arraigned on explosives and weapons charges. He entered a not guilty plea and was remanded without bail.      Officials declined to name the hospital where Gliedman had been taken, or to confirm or deny a report that she had given birth. She appears to have no prior arrest record and no previous troubles with the law, beyond the credit-card charge that led to her arrest.      She grew up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and attended Dalton Academy, a prestigious private school. Her parents, prominent oncologist Dr. Paul Gliedman and realtor Susyn Schops Gliedman, could not be reached for comment. A check of her Facebook friends showed a who’s who of the sons and daughters of some of New York’s richest and most notable families.      According to a neighbor who asked not to be named, a very different Gliedman moved into the apartment seven years ago, when she was an undergraduate at NYU.      “She was seemingly a happy-go-lucky girl,” the neighbor told The Daily Beast.      After graduating from NYU, Gliedman earned a master's degree in creative writing at the Art Institute of Chicago, according to her Facebook page. She returned to her apartment two years ago, no longer manifestly happy and not looking so lucky.      “A very changed person,” the neighbor says.      Greene moved in around the same time, according to her neighbor, who describes both Greene and this very different Gliedman as “very unsociable people.”      \\"They were very insular and seemed kind of in their own world,\\" the neighbor says.      The neighbor remembers that Gliedman often had friends to the apartment during her NYU days. That changed when Greene took up residence.      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

The neighbor lends credence to the police view when he adds, “There was always a heavy cloud of smoke emanating from the place, and one got the sense that they were both heavily into drugs.”      Green’s personal hygiene, cops say, is what might have been expected of a junkie.      \\"To be honest, you could smell him before you saw him,\\" the neighbor says.      The neighbor said that he could not help but be concerned on seeing that Gliedman was pregnant. He reports that Gliedman’s mother had visited often in recent days, as might be expected with the baby’s imminent arrival.      The other visitors were the police. The criminal complaint filed against Greene and Gliedman says that the cops discovered a plastic container in the living room holding seven grams of a white power that was identified as Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine, or HMTD, an easy-to-make explosive and a favorite of actual terrorists.      The complaint says that police also found the makings for more of the stuff, as well as a sawed-off 12-gauge Mossberg 500 shotgun, a Ruger 12-gauge shotgun, a dozen 12-gauge shotgun shells, 9 high-capacity rifle magazines, and 60 5.56-caliber tracer rounds. There was also a 37mm flare launcher, a replica of a M203 grenade launcher.      The complaint also lists a number of books and manuals said to be found in the apartment:      - The Terrorist’s Encyclopedia V. 1.02      - FM 5-25 Explosives and Demolitions      - FM 5-31 Booby Traps      - Improvised and Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons      - A Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun      - Street Sweeper: A Home Workshop Shotgun      - Building the M11/9: A Guide to Construction and Coercion      - FM 5-25 Explosives and Demolitions      - FM 5-31 Booby Traps      These were seized, along with what police describe as various handwritten notebooks containing formulas.            But further investigation produced no indication that this was a case of Gossip Girl gone terrorist.      “So far, no plot,” the senior police official said.      The official did not offer an explanation as to why the couple had allegedly amassed all the requirements of a terror cell but apparently not the intent. The absence of drugs in the apartment has apparently not dissuaded them from taking the view that the two are junkies with advantages.      Police report that Greene has been arrested three times on weapons charges, in 2005, 2006, and most recently in February, when he was also charged with drug possession. He had one prior arrest for drugs in 2004, an assault charge along with the weapons collar in 2005. He was also busted for evading the subway fare in his home precinct in 2011—a grown man with two Harvard degrees and a Dalton girlfriend charged with hopping a subway turnstile like a like schoolkid.      The disposition of the various cases was not immediately clear, though police records for the 2006 weapons arrest notes a “prior felony conviction.”      People with extensive knowledge of the Occupy Wall Street movement were saying that they had never heard of Greene. They discounted a news report that he was an OWS activist.      By midday Sunday, police had reached the tentative conclusion that the explosives and weapons were part of some drug-fueled fantasy life. To cops, Greene appears to be living proof that going to Harvard does not necessarily make you any less a knucklehead. ||||| Doctor's daughter who had baby in custody after she was arrested for keeping explosives in apartment 'robbed a man after meeting at a bar in February'      Morgan Gliedman, 27, allegedly stole a laptop, cellphone, wallet and credit cards from a man she met in a Manhattan bar in February 2012            Just days later, she and Harvard-educated boyfriend Aaron Greene, 31, were caught taking heroin and in possession of a gun in a Washington Heights drug bust      On Saturday, the well-to-do junkies were charged with keeping high-powered explosives in their apartment, where police also found a stash of weapons and terrorism how-to guides      Gliedman went into labor while she was being handcuffed      By Michael Zennie and Helen Pow      |      A Park Avenue-raised heroin addict who was last week charged with keeping high-powered explosives in her Greenwich Village apartment was already a suspect in a robbery.

Five days after the robbery, on February 22, she and her Harvard-graduate boyfriend, and father of her child, Aaron Greene were arrested for possession drugs and found with a .223-caliber rifle, The Post reported.      The couple were spotted with another woman in a car that was parked at West 176th Street and Haven Avenue. Greene, 31, was seen injecting heroin while one of the women snorted the drug, a criminal complaint said.      Police officers found empty heroin bags on the floor, marijuana and a digital scale with heroin residue in one of the women's handbags, according to The Post, and Greene admitted to having a gun.

Her mother is Susyn Schops Gliedman, a top New York real estate agent      Inside the apartment, officers found seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings.      The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive.            Police also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a 1,000 Ruger over-under hunting shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a replica of an M203 grenade launcher.            Several disturbing items were seized, including: 'The Terrorist’s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby traps and explosives.      The New York Post reported that Greene was a member of Occupy Wall Street, though an NYPD spokesman told MailOnline that his connection to the group was still being investigated.            Evacuation: All of the residents of the couple's building had to be removed from the area before a police bomb disposal unit could clear out the explosive      Two spokesmen for the Occupy movement said they had never heard of Greene.            Officers were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and Greene in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported.      The apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street, is near the apartment where two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970.            Greene and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources are saying. They are just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' according to the Daily Beast.            Neighbors said Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a top New York real estate agent, visited her often at the Greenwich apartment.

Heat the eggs to a low boil, using medium-high heat. Allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for 15 minutes.\\" Article:","output":"The Mastery of Perfectly Boiling Eggs: An Essential Skill in Culinary Endeavours  Boiling an egg, as simple as it may sound, can be a cynosure of challenges. It can confuse even an accomplished home cook or a rookie just starting out in the kitchen. The temperamental nature of eggs, their delicateness, and the continuum between a soft and hard boil can be tricky terrain to navigate for many. To demystify this common culinary task, we will dive deep into a failproof method to achieve perfect boiled eggs every time. To begin with, you would need six to eight eggs, a medium saucepan, water, distilled white vinegar, and of course, a stove. The number of eggs you choose to boil purely depends upon your requirement. The key here is not to overcrowd the saucepan. Neglecting this may lead to uneven cooking or potential breakages due to lack of space. Ensuring that the eggs you are using are fresh will guarantee the best results. Place the eggs gently into a medium saucepan, a tool found in almost every kitchen, carefully ensuring that the potential for cracking is reduced. The next step involves covering the eggs with water. The water acts as the medium for heat transfer and facilitates the cooking process. The eggs should be entirely submerged, with about 1-2 inches of water above the top-most egg. This is crucial for even heat distribution and uniform cooking. Pouring a splash of distilled white vinegar into the water is one of the secret, yet straightforward tricks that result in flawlessly boiled eggs. Vinegar yields two main benefits in this process. First, it helps to solidify the egg white faster if the shell cracks during cooking. Secondly, it makes peeling the boiled eggs easier as the vinegar permeates the shell slightly, which helps in detaching it from the egg white during peeling.  Setting the stove's heat to medium-high, place the saucepan on it and start heating. The aim here is to bring the water to a low boil. A raging boil may make your eggs dance and tap against each other, leading to unwanted cracks. But a low, gentle boil ensures that the egg cooks thoroughly without the hustle and bustle that might damage it.  Once you've reached that ideal slow boil, it's time for a bit of patience. Allow the eggs to sit in this hot water for about fifteen minutes. Time management is quintessential here. Boiling time decides whether your egg lands up being a gooey mess or a rock-hard disappointment. Fifteen minutes is the sweet spot for a delightfully creamy yet firm yolk, perfect for a multitude of culinary applications, from making egg salad to garnishing a bowl of ramen.   For cooking enthusiasts, understanding the perfect technique for boiling eggs opens up a world of culinary opportunities. Follow these steps carefully, and you're sure to crack the code to the perfectly boiled egg each time. In summary, boiling an egg is not just about immersing it in water and heating it but about managing elements such as the egg's freshness, water quantity, vinegar volume, heat level, and perhaps most importantly, timing. Happy cooking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Article: The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are boosters to the brain and better therapy than some guide books, researchers say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners  , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read.

Have you ever heard of paper quilling? It's a super fun and creative way to make beautiful art with just a few simple materials. In this article, we're going to show you how to do it step by step. Are you ready? Let's start! First, let's talk about what you need for this activity. You'll need: 1. Colorful paper strips (you can use construction paper or any other kind of paper you like) 2. Glue (a glue stick or liquid glue will both work great) 3. A tool to roll the paper (you can use a toothpick, a stick, or even your fingers!) Now that we've got everything, let's begin! Step 1: Make a coil To start, take one of your colorful paper strips and gently wrap it around your rolling tool (toothpick, stick, or fingers). Keep wrapping the paper until you've reached the end of the strip. You should have a nice, tight coil when you're done. Step 2: Gently pull the coil off Now that you have your coil, it's important to take it off the rolling tool very gently. You don't want to squish your beautiful creation! Gently slide your coil off the rolling tool and put it on the table. Step 3: Glue your paper together To make sure your coil stays together, you need to add a little bit of glue. Take your glue and spread a small amount on the end of the paper strip that's sticking out. Press the glued end onto the rest of the coil and hold it for a few seconds to make sure it sticks. Good job! Step 4: Pinch the coil into a shape (if desired) This step is optional, but it can be a lot of fun! If you want to make a shape out of your coil, like a heart or a flower, simply pinch the edges of the coil gently with your fingers. You can create all kinds of different shapes! Step 5: Glue all your pieces together Once you have all your coils and shapes ready, it's time to glue them together to create a beautiful picture. Use your glue to stick your coils and shapes onto a piece of paper. You can arrange them however you like – it's your art! Step 6: Finished That's it! You've made your very own paper quilling masterpiece. Now it's time to show it off to your family and friends. They'll be amazed by your creativity! Step 7: Try out some patterns and projects Now that you know how to do paper quilling, you can try out different patterns and projects. Look for books, websites, or videos that show different ideas and get inspired to create even more beautiful art! Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you do paper quilling, the better you'll get at it. Have fun, and happy quilling!"},{"instruction":"Q: Title: This deserves a million stars!

And now, if you want, your Facebook friends will always know where you are, too. Facebook is introducing a mobile feature called Nearby Friends that taps into that steady stream of location information so friends can track each other in real time. The idea is to make it easy for people to meet up in real life, so they can have conversations in person instead of comment threads, temporarily replacing Likes and LOLs with eye contact and actual laughter. A live meet-up is also an excellent opportunity to grab a selfie with your pal and upload it to the Facebook owned Instagram. In a refreshing change, the new Nearby Friends feature is not turned on by default. Friends will not be able to see where you are unless you decide live-tracking is something you want in your life and visit Facebook's settings to turn it on. Making a potentially invasive new feature opt-in suggests Facebook has perhaps learned from some of its past mistakes and privacy problems. You can choose to share your general location with all your Facebook friends, close friends or a customized list of people you feel most comfortable with. Further minimizing the potential stalking factor, your location is only shared with other people who are also using the feature and who have chosen to share their location with you. When turned on, Nearby Friends shows a list of approved Facebook friends who also use the feature and shows their approximate location. A push notification can tell you how many of your friends are nearby. Open the app to see a list of pals, the neighborhood or city where they are, how many miles away that is from your current location, and a time stamp of when they where there. There is an option to share your exact location with specific friends, which can be handy for coordinating large groups at concerts or finding someone in a crowded area. Your friends will see a little image of your face on a map for a set period of time. Nearby Friends will be available on Facebook's iOS and Android apps, but will only work for select locations at first. Facebook, Instagram and many other apps already include features that let people \\"check-in\\" to locations, but those location features are different because you decide if and when to share each specific location. You might check into a Starbucks downtown, but never into your home or other spot you'd rather keep private. Nearby Friends is continuously gathering details about where you are in the background instead of waiting for a manual check-in. This is not the first time an app has used location information to physically connect friends. Similar apps such as Highlight, which got a flurry of attention in 2012, mapped out the locations of nearby strangers. Facebook also purchased a startup in 2012 called Glancee that also connected strangers. That technology evolved into this new, more private feature. If you turn on the Nearby Friends feature, Facebook starts collecting data on your exact location and keeps details on where you've been in the past, not just places where you've used its app to check in. It also collects location information even when the Facebook app is closed. But you can turn off this location history in the Facebook app's settings. It's possible to delete individual locations from a history, or clear the whole thing and start from scratch. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Facebook has a feature called Nearby Friends for your phone. It lets your friends know where you are if you want them to.

A:","output":"The last step of the process for a red giant star involves the formation of a white dwarf and the possible creation of a planetary nebula. As the outer layers of the red giant break away, the core continues to contract and heat up. This hot, compact core, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, stabilizes as a white dwarf. A white dwarf is the final stage for a low- to intermediate-mass star like the red giant. It is an incredibly dense stellar remnant that has exhausted its nuclear fuel but remains intensely hot. Over time, the white dwarf will cool down gradually, eventually becoming a black dwarf. However, this process takes an extraordinarily long time, much longer than the current age of the universe, so no black dwarfs are believed to exist yet. As the white dwarf forms, the ejected outer layers of the red giant gradually expand outward from the core, creating a nebula of gas and dust. This nebula is illuminated by the intense light emitted by the hot white dwarf, forming a celestial spectacle known as a planetary nebula. The term \\"planetary nebula\\" is a misnomer, as the phenomenon is not directly related to planets. It is so named because early astronomers, when looking through their telescopes, saw a circular structure similar to planetary disks. It is important to note that the fate of a star is largely determined by its mass. Stars with a greater mass than the red giants will follow a different path, either exploding in a supernova and becoming a neutron star or collapsing to form a black hole. However, for red giants like the one described in the question, the transformation into a white dwarf followed by the formation of a planetary nebula is the last stage of its evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise. He was ill for several weeks, and for the sake of his health the family moved from their Cecil Court lodgings to a house in the countryside, at 180 Ebury Street, then considered part of the village of Chelsea.

Nearly 800 detainees have passed through the centre since it was set up under the Bush administration in 2002 to hold \\"enemy combatants\\" from the war in Afghanistan - and 166 are still being held there. More than half of these inmates - 89 men - come from Yemen. They were largely picked up around in Afghanistan or border areas 11 years ago on suspicion of involvement with al-Qaeda. But of the 86 men in Guantanamo who have been cleared for transfer or release, 56 are Yemeni. They are no longer considered enemy combatants or a threat to US security. Many of other nationalities - including Europeans, Saudi Arabians and Afghans - have been moved on due to agreements with their home countries. But the Yemenis have been going nowhere. \\"The Europeans went home first, as did others whose home countries did quite a bit of advocacy on their behalf,\\" said Martha Rayner, Clinical Associate Professor of Law at Fordham University in New York, who has represented some of Guantanamo's Yemeni inmates. \\"The Yemenis had the misfortune of coming from a country that had had a dictator for many years - Ali Abdullah Saleh - and that didn't do enough to advocate for its nationals. \\"So the Yemenis languished, even though many were approved for release by the Bush administration.\\" In January 2009, President Obama ordered the closure of Guantanamo within a year. But on Christmas Day of that year, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab - a Nigerian trained in Yemen - attempted to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear on a Detroit-bound jet. And the following January, President Obama issued a moratorium against the release of any Yemeni detainees. Combined with restrictions imposed by Congress, it brought releases and transfers to a virtual halt. \\"I think it was a practical response,\\" said Ms Rayner. \\"It was a year since Obama had come into power and his critics were already galvanising themselves to challenge him on the issue of Guantanamo and connecting it to national security.\\" Matthew Waxman, professor at Columbia Law School and former Department of Defense adviser on detention issues, sees it as a more international issue. \\"During that time, the view was that violent instability in Yemen made returning detainees too risky,\\" he said. \\"There was little confidence that the Yemeni government would be able to mitigate any continuing threat that the returned Guantanamo detainees would pose.\\" Al-Qaeda gained territory during the Yemen revolution in 2011, taking control of towns predominantly in the Abyan region in the south west of the country. Yemen's new President, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, led a US-backed military offensive against them in the summer of 2012, pushing the insurgents out of Abyan. But their presence continued - their numbers rose from hundreds estimated in 2009-2010 to several thousands believed to be operating in the country in 2013. Suicide bombings and assassinations of military and security personnel became common. A growing anti-American sentiment has also been fuelled by a popular Shia Houthi rebellion and hated US military drone strikes. This instability, combined with a lack of infrastructure and rehabilitation services in Yemen, means that Guantanamo's Yemeni detainees may not be going back just yet. Former prisoner Said Ali al-Shihri, who was returned to Saudi Arabia, went on to become a leading member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), now seen as the country's greatest threat. US officials fear other former inmates - radicalised in the detention centre if not before - will go straight to fight for al-Qaeda once released. Nevertheless, President Obama said on Thursday: \\"I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen so we can review them on a case-by-case basis. \\"To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries.\\" Ms Rayner believes the move is connected to a hunger strike, which is being staged by around 100 detainees and has attracted worldwide attention. \\"I think the hunger strike has made the Obama administration move Guantanamo up its priority list.\\" But Wells C Bennett, an expert in national security law at the Brookings Institution, said it was a sign of increased US confidence in the Yemeni government. \\"It may mean that the administration is beginning to feel more positively about security,\\" he said. Analysts agree, however, that a number of hurdles remain, such as strict requirements imposed by Congress that mean that Guantanamo's Yemeni detainees may not be transferred or released imminently. Much depends on how much energy the Obama administration is willing to expend. \\"I am hopeful that a few Yemenis will go home,\\" Ms Rayner said, \\"but I think it will be a small number.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"This text talks about the Guantanamo detention center where people were kept because they were thought to be dangerous. Many of the people there are from Yemen. A few years ago, President Obama wanted to close the Guantanamo center, but it did not happen. Now, President Obama is thinking about letting some people from Yemen go home. This is a difficult decision because Yemen has had some problems and some people worry that these people could cause more trouble if they go home.

Write a title for this article: In the 1968 movie \\"Bullitt,\\" actor Steve McQueen plays a police detective who floors his Mustang GT in a tire-screeching car chase up, down and over San Francisco's hills. Fast-forward to the 21st century: Traffic accidents have exceeded gunfire as the leading cause of police on-duty deaths for 14 of the past 15 years. A 2011 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study of 733 fatal police crashes found half involved only the officer-driven vehicle. Forty-two percent of the officers who died didn't have their seat belts on. \\"It's ironic that police officers present the greatest dangers to themselves as they try to help the public,\\" said Pat Tobin, a retired San Francisco police motorcycle supervisor who lectures on officer safety. \\"But honestly, that is the case.\\" The good news is years of trainers' attempts to break through the pedal-to-metal, no-seat-belt police culture appear to be paying off. There's a chance that nationwide on-duty deaths for 2013 will total fewer than 100 for the first time since World War II. Among the primary reasons for the drop is safer driving. Vehicular-related deaths have accounted for 43 of 99 on-duty deaths so far this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, an online site that tracks officer deaths. That's five fewer traffic deaths than in 2012 and a drop of 19 since 2011. \\"This is a historic moment for law enforcement,\\" said Dale Stockton, a retired Carlsbad (San Diego County) police captain who heads Below 100, which offers safety training to police departments nationwide. \\"Barring a catastrophe, we'll come in at a level as low as anyone has seen since 1944, when most every crime-demographic male was out of the country. No one wearing a badge today has ever experienced a year with a loss level this low.\\" With guns proliferating nationwide, gunfire remains a major concern and is the No. 2 cause of officer deaths, with 29 recorded so far in 2013. But that's an improvement over 2012, when 47 died from shootings, and a big reduction from the 67 officers shot and killed in 2011. In California, nine officers have died so far in 2013, four from vehicular accidents and five from gunfire. Among those felled by bullets: An officer in Galt, south of Sacramento, killed by a burglary suspect, and two Santa Cruz police officers killed when a subject of a sexual assault investigation answered their door-knock with gunfire. The 2,197-officer San Francisco Police Department has not had an on-duty death since 2006 when it lost two officers, one to gunfire and one to an auto accident. Below 100 training stresses simple things officers can do to improve their odds on the streets and highways: Wear seat belts and body armor, reduce speed and avoid complacency. For decades, officers have resisted seat belts and body armor as restricting their ability to exit vehicles quickly and maneuver. Police drive fast to actual emergencies but sometimes officers speed \\"because they can,\\" Stockton said. Officers who wear seat belts or don't speed in nonemergency situations often feel they have to explain themselves to eye-rolling colleagues. But police training increasingly emphasizes anticipating danger in seemingly routine situations such as serving warrants and making car stops. Technology is helping police departments monitor police-cruiser speed remotely, and research is under way into disabling getaway cars without police chasing them. The San Francisco Police Department now requires officers to wear seat belts and follow strict rules about high-speed chases, confining them to pursuits of drunken drivers or suspects in felony or domestic violence cases. Of \\"Bullitt\\" and its depiction of heavy-metal cars cresting hills airborne, Officer Albie Esparza, an SFPD spokesman, said: \\"Those days are over.\\" \\"It's not that we don't ever chase, because we do,\\" Esparza said. \\"But it has to be a violent felony. It's all for public safety as well as officer safety.\\" Dan Freedman is a reporter in the Hearst Newspapers Washington bureau.

Unfortunately, millions of kids can't hear what their teachers are saying. And it's not because these students are _ . Often, it's the room's fault. Building architecture and building design can createecho -filled classrooms that make hearing difficult. Children with hearingimpairments suffer most from noisy classrooms. They sometimes can't hear questions that other students ask in class. Compared with kids with healthy hearing, they have a harder time picking up new vocabulary words by hearing them in talking. Even kids with normal hearing have a harder time in the classroom when there's too much noise. Younger children in particular have trouble separating important sounds - like a teacher's voice - from background noise. Kids with learning disabilities and speechimpediments and kids for whom English is a second language also have a harder time learning in noisy situations. In recent years, scientists who study sound have been asking schools to reduce background noise, which may include loud air-conditioners and pipes. They're also targeting outdoor noises, such as highway traffic. Noise reduction is a big deal. Why? Because quieter classrooms might make you smarter by letting you hear your lessons better. \\"It's so obvious that we should have quiet rooms that allow for access to the lesson,\\" says Dan Ostergren, a hearing scientist. \\"Sometimes it surprises me that we spend so much time discussing this topic.

Article: We all have ideas about what kinds of foods are good or bad to eat. As a result, people from one culture often think the foods that people from another culture eat are unacceptable. Many people would find it terrible to eat rats, but there are forty-two different cultures whose people regard rats as proper food. Food likes and dislikes do not always seem related to nutrition. For example, broccoli   is first on a list of the most nutritious common vegetables, but it is twenty-first on a list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. Tomatoes are sixteenth on the list of most nutritious vegetables, but they are first on the list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. But dislikes is not the only reason why some cultures will not eat a certain food. In some cultures, certain foods are taboo. Taboo is a word from the language of the Fiji Islands that is used to describe something that is forbidden. We do not usually think about why certain things are taboo in our culture. One example is that Americans do not eat dogs, although people from some other cultures regard them as good food. In the United States, dogs are very important to people as pets. They are usually regarded as part of the family, almost like a child in some cases. In addition, dogs have value as protection against criminals  . Actually, the dog's place in society as a companion makes the dog taboo as food. Scientists believe that most food likes and dislikes are a result of the ways of life of different people. People will not eat pets such as dogs. Americans eat a lot of beef because there is plenty of land for raising cattle and their meat can be shipped cheaply for long distances by railroads. Question: Why is eating dogs a taboo in America? Answer: Select from the following.  *It is a taboo from the Fiji Islands.;  *It is against American laws.;  *Dogs are needed by the police.;  *Dogs are close to human life.; The answer is:","output":"Dogs are close to human life. Eating dogs is considered a taboo in America primarily due to the close relationship and emotional attachment that Americans have with dogs. In the United States, dogs are often valued as companions and pets, playing significant roles within families and providing protection against criminals. They are an integral part of society and are usually regarded as family members in many cases, sometimes even likened to children. This emotional bond and the value attributed to dogs as companions make them unsuitable for consumption in the eyes of the American culture. While the Fiji Islands introduced the term \\"taboo\\" to describe forbidden practices, the taboo against eating dogs in America is a result of the cultural and emotional associations that have been developed with these animals over time. It is also worth noting that the way the culture and living conditions of the people influence their food preferences. For instance, Americans consume a lot of beef due to the availability of land for raising cattle and the efficiency of transportation systems for shipping meat across long distances. Therefore, cultural values and environmental factors play a crucial role in determining what is considered acceptable or unacceptable to eat in different societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mathayus aims to avenge the death of his father at the hand of Sargon, now king of Akkad, by taking service in his Black Scorpions squad. After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes, tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung.

He intends to promote Corningstone, making her the first female nightly news anchor in the history of television, and to fire Burgundy due to his continuously sloppy performance on air. Burgundy grows jealous of Corningstone's success and storms out of the house, leaving her and their six-year-old son Walter (Judah Nelson). Six months later, Burgundy is back in San Diego, but barely able to hold a job due to his depression. After being fired from SeaWorld and botching a suicide attempt, Burgundy accepts a job offered to him by Freddie Shapp (Dylan Baker) with GNN, the world's first 24-hour news network, for the station's official launch. He reassembles his news team, finding Champ Kind (David Koechner), who owns a fried chicken store (that sells bats secretly to cut down on costs), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), now a famous cat photographer, and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), who is presumed dead but appears at his own funeral. They are assigned the unpopular late-night timeslot while obnoxious rival anchorman Jack Lime (James Marsden) is put in a primetime slot. Meanwhile, Burgundy finds that Corningstone has started dating psychologist Gary (Greg Kinnear). As GNN launches, Burgundy decides to broadcast what the people want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. He and his team devise a sensationalist and patriotic newscast. Their new approach proves to be a hit, beating Lime in ratings by a massive margin, and the other news networks scramble to emulate them. Burgundy and his team are promoted to primetime, where they enjoy fame and fortune. Burgundy's success excites GNN's manager, Linda Jackson (Meagan Good), and they begin a romantic relationship. Tamland meets a similarly eccentric GNN office worker named Chani (Kristen...

The Englishmen say \\"Have you a pen?\\" While Americans say \\"Do you have a pen?\\" The pronunciation is sometimes different. Americans often sound \\"r\\" in words like \\"bird\\" and \\"hurt\\". The British speakers don't sound the \\"r\\" in these words. There are differences in spelling. For example, \\"colour\\" and \\"neighbour\\" are British while \\"color\\" and \\"neighbor\\" are American. These differences in grammar, pronunciation and spelling are not important, however. For the most part, British and American English are the same language. When Englishmen and Americans are talking with each other, they don't need an interpreter .

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Have you are burned something on the stove or in the oven? Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs.  Question: \\"Why do things burn?\\" Answer: \\"Due to raise in temperature\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"Why do things burn?\\" is correct. Burning occurs due to a raise in temperature, which can cause chemical changes and accelerate the rate of change in matter. This increase in temperature, when high enough, can lead to combustion or burning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces  ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

Context: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

Plot title: Wild Hogs Movie plot: Doug Madsen (Tim Allen), Woody Stevens (John Travolta), Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence), and Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) are four middle-aged suburban men living in a Cincinnati area suburb who find themselves frustrated with the pace of daily life and lack of adventure. Doug is a dentist who has trouble relating to his son Billy (Dominic Janes), Dudley is a single clumsy computer programmer who is afraid to talk to women. Bobby is a henpecked plumber whose wife has made him return to work after having taken a year off to unsuccessfully write a book, and Woody is a rich lawyer married to a supermodel. They find escape from their daily routines on weekends by riding motorcycles together posing as a biker gang called the \\"Wild Hogs\\". One day, when Woody finds out his wife is divorcing him and leaving him bankrupt, he and his friends go on a road trip on their bikes to California. After encountering several misadventures, they end up at a local bar, where they meet a much larger biker gang called the Del Fuegos, headed by Jack Blade (Ray Liotta). Jack calls the Wild Hogs \\"posers\\" and has his gang take Dudley's bike after a bogus deal to exchange Dudley's bike for a new bike that is in fact old and derelict, forcing the men to leave with Dudley in a sidecar attached to Woody's bike. Outraged at their actions, Woody returns to the Del Fuegos bar and retrieves Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel supplies in the process and fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he \\"negotiated\\" with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding. Eventually, the Wild Hogs run out of gas and end up in Madrid, New Mexico, where they stumble into a diner and help themselves to water and beer... My question: Who do the townspeople hold as heros?

By doing so, the Wild Hogs not only gain the respect and admiration of the people in Madrid, but they also rediscover the sense of adventure and excitement they were seeking through their motorcycling journey. Consequently, they become local heroes for the townspeople, who are grateful for their efforts in protecting the town and confronting the Del Fuegos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tarantino is known for his unique style, characterized by nonlinear storytelling, eclectic dialogue, and tributes to popular culture. He is considered one of the most influential film directors of his generation.  \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994) is a crime film that weaves together three interconnected storylines primarily revolving around two hitmen, a boxer, and a gangster's wife. The film is acclaimed for its innovative structure and sharp writing, and its combination of humor, action, and drama. It gave a fresh spin to the crime genre while paying homage to pulp magazines and hard-boiled crime novels of the past. Upon its release, \\"Pulp Fiction\\" received universal acclaim, and it went on to become a major box-office success. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning Best Original Screenplay for Tarantino and Roger Avary. \\"Kill Bill\\" is an action-packed revenge saga released in two separate volumes. \\"Kill Bill: Volume 1\\" (2003) and \\"Kill Bill: Volume 2\\" (2004) follow The Bride, played by Uma Thurman, as she seeks retribution against a team of assassins and their leader, Bill, after they crash her wedding and leave her for dead. The films are a homage to numerous movie genres, including martial arts films, spaghetti westerns, and Japanese samurai films. The distinctive visual styles, use of music, and carefully orchestrated action sequences, along with Tarantino's signature dialogue, make the \\"Kill Bill\\" series unforgettable, garnering widespread critical acclaim and box office success. Throughout his career, Tarantino has directed numerous other films, such as \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" (1992), \\"Jackie Brown\\" (1997), \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" (2009), \\"Django Unchained\\" (2012), \\"The Hateful Eight\\" (2015), and \\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\\" (2019).

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - death - pleasure - reward - satisfaction - sadness The answer is:","output":"satisfaction When giving assistance to family members in need, one may feel a sense of satisfaction. This feeling comes from the knowledge that you are helping a loved one, and it is a natural human response to derive pleasure from aiding those we care about. The satisfaction results from a combination of empathy, love, and the gratification of making a positive impact on someone else's life. Helping family members in their time of need not only strengthens the bond between individuals but also creates a foundation of trust and emotional support. The other options - death, pleasure, reward, and sadness - do not convey the same level of emotional connection or fulfillment one would experience from assisting a family member in need. Choosing death or sadness as an answer would imply a negative or uncomfortable feeling, which is not something one would typically associate with helping family. While pleasure and reward are both positive emotions, their connotations lean more towards a self-focused feeling rather than a communal or empathic action. Pleasure suggests enjoying oneself, potentially at the expense of others, and reward implies a self-serving attitude, expecting compensation for one's actions. On the contrary, satisfaction implies a sense of balance and gratification that comes from doing something positive for someone else, particularly a family member in need. This option reflects the altruistic nature of our relationships with those closest to us and the way in which their well-being directly affects our own emotional state. In conclusion, satisfaction is the most suitable option for answering the given question because it best represents the feelings one might experience when extending help and support to family members in need. These feelings stem from the strong bonds that connect loved ones and defy the expectation of personal gain, highlighting the deep-seated sense of fulfillment that comes from attending to the needs of those we hold dear."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Transportation and warehousing contribute approximately C2.2 billion to Manitoba's GDP. Total employment in the industry is estimated at 34,500, or around 5 percent of Manitoba's population. Trucks haul 95 percent of land freight in Manitoba, and trucking companies account for 80 percent of Manitoba's merchandise trade to the United States. Five of Canada's twenty-five largest employers in for-hire trucking are headquartered in Manitoba. C1.18 billion of Manitoba's GDP comes directly or indirectly from trucking.Greyhound Canada and Grey Goose Bus Lines offer domestic bus service from the Winnipeg Bus Terminal. The terminal was relocated from downtown Winnipeg to the airport in 2009, and is a Greyhound hub. Municipalities also operate localized transit bus systems. Manitoba has two Class I railways: Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Winnipeg is centrally located on the main lines of both carriers, and both maintain large inter-modal terminals in the city. CN and CPR operate a combined 2,439 kilometres (1,516 mi) of track in Manitoba. Via Rail offers transcontinental and Northern Manitoba passenger service from Winnipeg's Union Station. Numerous small regional and short-line railways also run trains within Manitoba: the Hudson Bay Railway, the Southern Manitoba Railway, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Manitoba, Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway, and Central Manitoba Railway. Together, these smaller lines operate approximately 1,775 kilometres (1,103 mi) of track in the province.

Context: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice... Question: What is probably true about the bar association Answer: Answer:","output":"The American Bar Association probably supports efforts to reform the U.S. criminal justice system, given that it has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, which is a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first sentence, \\"A drop of each sample was analyzed,\\" the word \\"drop\\" is used as a noun and refers to a small quantity of liquid.

In the second sentence, \\"There was a drop in pressure in the pulmonary artery,\\" the word \\"drop\\" is again used as a noun but signifies a reduction or decrease - in this case, in pressure. This definition is more abstract and describes a change in condition or status.  So, while \\"drop\\" is used as a noun in both sentences, it carries different meanings within each context.

He is an Associate Dean at a local college, while his wife teaches art to children. When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a serial rapist, Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant. When Paula Bell (Gwyneth Paltrow), one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a semen sample to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's ovaries, which has ruptured due to a cyst, Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the fetus to abort. Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is torsed and appears necrotic. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. With this knowledge, Tracy and Andy decide to sue Jed and the hospital.

Wrote Savage: \\"Coaches were awesome, campus is great and I bonded with the players a lot.\\" Savage spent Tuesday and Wednesday on a recruiting trip to the University of Arizona. He left Thursday morning to return to his home in Springfield, Pa., outside of Philadelphia. \\"I have always wanted to go out there and take a look,\\" Savage told TucsonCitizen.com on Monday. \\"I really want to find a home and I'm just looking forward to getting out of this cold.\\" This was the only recruiting trip Savage took after leaving Rutgers following last season. In an earlier interview, he said he was hoping to enroll at his new destination as early as possible in the summer. He is not taking classes at Rutgers this spring. Savage will have to sit out the 2011 season as a transfer. He will have two years of eligibility remaining, beginning with 2012. His commitment gives the Wildcats much more continuity at the quarterback position, filling what quarterbacks coach Frank Scelfo described last week as a \\"hole\\" in Arizona's recruiting. In a perfect world, senior Nick Foles stays healthy for 2011 and senior Matt Scott redshirts, as is his preference. Arizona would have Scott and Savage to compete in 2012 … and, after that, Arizona has another year of Savage with plenty of time to develop and add other quarterbacks. And if Scott can't redshirt, Arizona now has a quarterback with experience in 2012 to go along with young guys Cam Allerheiligen and Daxx Garman. Savage (6-5, 226) was a Freshman All-American in 2009, becoming a starter in the second game and being voted the team's Offensive MVP for the season. He completed 149 of 289 passes for 2,211 yards, with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He was ineffective early in the 2010 season, suffered a hand injury and then didn't play much the rest of the way. As a sophomore, he was 43 of 83 for 521 yards, with two touchdowns and three interceptions. See photos of: Arizona Wildcats To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor .

Is \\"Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule\\" is generally correct, although it could benefit from further elaboration for clarity and context. Rome, a city-state located in the central part of the Italian peninsula, eventually became the dominant entity throughout the peninsula and beyond. The Italian peninsula is an elongated boot-shaped landmass in Southern Europe, bounded by the Adriatic Sea on the east, the Ionian Sea on the south, the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west, and the Alps to the north. Italy's geography and location in the Mediterranean made it a strategic area in ancient times, particularly for trade, commerce, and military expansion. The region was home to several notable civilizations, including the Etruscans and the ancient Greeks, who built a number of colonies in southern Italy. Initially, Rome was just one of many competing city-states on the Italian peninsula. However, through a series of strategic alliances, conquests, and diplomatic maneuvers, Rome was able to expand its domain. By around 275 BCE, Rome had conquered or subdued the other city-states on the peninsula: the Etruscans to the north, the Greeks in the south, and the Samnites and other groups in the central, eastern, and southern regions. Once the Italian peninsula was under Roman control, Rome's ambition shifted towards the submission of the Greek cities. The conclusion of the First Punic War in 241 BCE led Rome to engage in conflicts with the Hellenistic states in the eastern Mediterranean. These struggles included the Illyrian Wars, Macedonian Wars, and Syrian War, which played a pivotal role in reshaping the power balance in the eastern Mediterranean. The Roman victory over the Greek city-states in the Battle of Corinth (146 BCE) marked the end of Greek political independence and finalized Rome's domination in the Mediterranean world. These conquests were indicative of Rome’s desire to control even more territory and power. Over time, Rome continued to dominate this region and incorporate other territories, ultimately forming the extensive Roman Empire that would endure for centuries. In summary, Rome indeed came to dominate the Italian peninsula throughout its history and sought control over other civilizations, including the Greek cities. The impressive growth of the Roman Republic and later, the Roman Empire, underscores the influence and power that Rome was able to amass during this period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is the mutant son of Professor Charles Xavier and Gabrielle Haller. Legion takes the role of an antihero who has a severe mental illness including a form of dissociative identity disorder, in which each of his alternate personas controls one of his many superpowers. The television series Legion premiered on FX network in 2017. When Mystique tracked down David years later to get revenge for \\"his\\" murder of Destiny, he awakened with his fractured mind healed. David had a new goal, to help his father realize his dream of human-mutant coexistence by killing Magneto, Xavier's greatest opponent, before he had a chance to amass power. He traveled twenty years into the past, when Xavier and Magneto were orderlies at the mental hospital. In the process, he loses his memory. Magneto then accidentally triggers his memory, causing David to go on a rampage, attacking Magneto and revealing the existence of mutants to the public decades too early. Several X-Men who were pulled back in time with him were unable to prevent him from attacking Magneto.

Due to being trapped in the past by David's actions, Bishop enlisted the aid of the new reality's X-Men to travel back in time to confront Legion again.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this article and answer this question It is believed that the Baltic languages are among the most archaic of the currently remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late attestation. Although the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by ancient historians as early as 98 B.C., the first attestation of a Baltic language was about 1350, with the creation of the Elbing Prussian Vocabulary, a German to Prussian translation dictionary. Lithuanian was first attested in a hymnal translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas was published in 1547 in Königsberg, Prussia . Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585. One reason for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples resisted Christianization longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence. With the establishment of a German state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct. During the years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , official documents were written in Polish, Ruthenian and Latin. After the Partitions of Commonwealth, most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the Russian Empire, where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a Russification effort . How many centuries after the establishment of a German state in Prussia the flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population","output":"Okay, let's see. The article talks about the establishment of a German state in Prussia in the 13th century. That is like counting up to 12 in hundreds (1200s). Then it says the Prussian language had become extinct by the end of the 17th century. That's like counting up to 16 in hundreds (1600s). So, to find out how many centuries passed between them, we can just think of it as subtracting 12 from 16. That would be 4, so four centuries passed after the establishment of a German state in Prussia and the flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: He was 11 years old and went fishing every chance he got from the dock at his family's cabin on an island in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake. When his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a perch . The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. Then the father lit a match  and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.--- two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. \\"You'll have to put it back, son,\\" he said. \\"Dad!\\" cried the boy. \\"There will be other fish,\\" said his father. \\"Not as big as this one,\\" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could know everything by his father's clear voice that the decision could not be changed. He slowly worked the hook  out of the lip of the huge bass and lowered it into the black water. The creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish. That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's cabin is still there on the island in the middle of the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing from the same dock. He was right. He has never again caught such a magnificent fish as the one he landed that night long ago. But he does see that same fish---again and again---every time he comes up against a question of ethics .

The given hypothesis speculates about the reason behind the game's release on the Game Boy console, suggesting it was due to its widespread popularity. However, the information provided in the context does not support this. The context explicitly states that the Game Boy version is a port of the NES version, but it doesn't mention anything about the game's popularity influencing this decision.

Summarize: Your total rise is the height from one story to the next that the stairs will connect. The total rise should be set in most cases, so you simply need to measure the height. This distance should be from the top of the finished floor below and the finished floor at the top. If the floor is unfinished when you are calculating your stringers, you need to take that into account. The height of each step can vary a bit but there are general standards. It is standard to have your riser be about 7 inches (18 cm) tall, so use this measurement unless you have specific parameters that prevent it, such as limited headroom.  This measurement is sometimes called the individual rise of the stairs. For this calculation you are simply figuring out how many stairs it will take to get the height you need. Use a calculator or do the arithmetic by hand, as it is generally pretty simple.  For example, if you want 7 inches (18 cm) tall stairs and your overall rise needs to be 56 inches (140 cm), then 56/7=8. You will need 8 stairs. The number of treads you have (individual runs) will automatically be one less than the number of risers. Your total run is the horizontal distance between the top and the bottom of the stairs. How far the stairs stick out can vary depending on your needs, but keep in mind that stairs should usually be at an angle of about 40 degrees.  In general, the run of each stair should be about 10 inches (25 cm) in order for people’s feet to fit comfortably as they walk up them. There are many stair calculators that you can use online to figure out stair measurements. You simply need to input your rise and the angle you want for your stairs and they will calculate the other measurements you need, including your run. Once you have the overall rise and run of the stairs, you can calculate how long the stringer needs to be. You can either use an online stair calculator, a hypotenuse calculator, or you can do the math yourself. To calculate the length yourself, you will need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which is a2 + b2 = c2. So, for example, if the rise needs to be 60 inches (150 cm) and the run needs to be 84 inches (210 cm), then you would calculate 602 + 842 = c2, with “c” being the length of 99 inches (250 cm). Ensure your math and calculations are correct so that you don’t waste your time and materials cutting risers that don’t fit. It’s better to take a few minutes to double check yourself than to waste a whole lot of time redoing your work.","output":"To summarize, when calculating stairs, measure the total rise, or the height between the floors the stairs connect. Consider the standard individual rise of 7 inches and divide the total rise by this measurement to determine the number of stairs needed. Keep in mind the angle of the stairs should be around 40 degrees and the run of each stair should be about 10 inches for comfort. Utilize online stair calculators for accurate measurements and ensure your calculations are correct before cutting materials to avoid wasting time and resources."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The woman: Both the premise and the given fact share the same subject, which is the \\"woman.\\" 2. Tired: In the premise, it is mentioned that the woman is tired. The fact that she is sleepy may suggest that she is indeed tired, as sleepiness is often a sign of tiredness or physical exhaustion. 3. Rests her head on her backpack: As a result of her tiredness and sleepiness, the woman decides to take a break and seek some comfort by resting her head on her backpack. This action seems plausible, considering her state of fatigue. 4. Lying down: The woman lying down implies that she is seeking relief from her exhaustion and trying to relax.

It was thought to have died out over 50 years ago, but photographers have managed to snap an exceptionally rare lizard in Ecuador. The long-nosed Pinocchio lizard was spotted by a team of photographers and researchers after combing a remote area in the north west of the country for three years. The lizard, which was first discovered in 1953 and named after the fictional lying puppet, was thought to be extinct until 2005 and it has only been sighted three times since. Scroll down for video. After searching for the rare long-nosed Pinocchio anole (pictured) for three years, a team of photographers and researchers found the lizard recently in a stretch of pristine cloud forest in the northwest part of Ecuador, around two hours drive from the capital. The lizard was named after Pinocchio (puppet, pictured), a fictional character whose nose grew each time he lied. The curious-looking animal did a disappearing act in the 1960s and was not seen again until an ornithologist saw one crossing the road in the same stretch of cloud forest. The animal was most recently captured by Alejandro Arteaga, a co-founder of an eco-tourism company called Tropical Herping, which has been searching for the almost long-lost animal. The researcher told LiveScience that the best time to spot the rare lizards known as anoles is at night when they are sleeping and less likely to run away. As part of an expedition in January, one of his sharp-eyed team saw a male Pinocchio anole scaling a branch and the team managed to catch it and keep it overnight until they could photograph it in its natural surroundings the following morning. Mr Arteaga said: 'After looking for so long It was very thrilling to find this strange lizard.' The male lizard's long nose actually serves no real purpose apart from advertising its good genes and female anoles select their mates based on whether it has an impressive appendage. The females do not have long noses. The curious animal was discovered in 1953 but disappeared from the 1960s until it was spotted again in 2005. Since then, the endangered species has been seen just three times.

Information:  - Peter of Luxembourg (1390  31 August 1433) was a son of John of Luxembourg, Lord of Beauvoir, and his wife Marguerite of Enghien. His inheritance included the counties of Brienne, Conversano and Saint-Pol.  - Jacquetta of Luxembourg, Countess Rivers (1415/1416  30 May 1472) was the eldest daughter of Peter I of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Conversano and Brienne and his wife Margaret of Baux (Margherita del Balzo of Andria). She was a prominent, though often overlooked, figure in the Wars of the Roses. Through her short-lived first marriage to the Duke of Bedford, brother of King Henry V, she was firmly allied to the House of Lancaster. However, following the emphatic Lancastrian defeat at the Battle of Towton, she and her second husband Richard Woodville sided closely with the House of York. Three years after the battle and the accession of Edward IV of England, Jacquetta's eldest daughter Elizabeth Woodville married him and became Queen consort of England. Jacquetta bore Woodville 14 children and stood trial on charges of witchcraft, for which she was exonerated.  - Richard Woodville (or Wydeville), 1st Earl Rivers (1405  12 August 1469) was an English nobleman, best remembered as the father of Queen consort Elizabeth Woodville and the maternal grandfather of Edward V and the maternal great-grandfather of Henry VIII.  - The House of York was a cadet branch of the English royal House of Plantagenet. Three of its members became Kings of England in the late 15th century. The House of York was descended in the male line from Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, the fourth surviving son of Edward III, but also represented Edward's senior line, being cognatic descendants of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, Edward III's second surviving son. It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown. Compared with the House of Lancaster, it had a senior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture but junior claim according to the agnatic primogeniture. The reign of this dynasty ended with the death of Richard III of England in 1485. It became extinct in the male line with the death of Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick in 1499.  - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.  - Cecily of York , Viscountess Welles ( 20 March 1469 -- 24 August 1507 ) was an English Princess and the third , but eventual second surviving , daughter of Edward IV , King of England and his queen consort Elizabeth Woodville , daughter of Richard Woodville , 1st Earl Rivers and Jacquetta of Luxembourg .  - Sir John Grey, of Groby, Leicestershire (c. 1432  17 February 1461) was a Lancastrian knight, the first husband of Elizabeth Woodville who later married King Edward IV of England, and great-great-grandfather of Lady Jane Grey.  - Margaret of Baux (; 1394  15 November 1469) was a Countess of Saint-Pol, of Brienne, and of Conversano. She was a member of the noble House of Baux of the Kingdom of Naples, which had its origins in Provence dating back to the 11th century. Her husband was Peter of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, of Brienne, and of Conversano (1390  31 August 1433). Margaret's descendants include English Queen Consort Elizabeth Woodville, King Henry IV of France, Mary, Queen of Scots, and all English monarchs after 1509.  - Sultan (') is a noble title with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \\"strength\\", \\"authority\\", \\"rulership\\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate.  - The House of Lancaster was the name of two cadet branches of the royal House of Plantagenet. The first house was created when Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort's death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons' War. When Edmund's son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law's estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand Henry, his younger brotherinto conflict with their cousin Edward II of England, leading to Thomas's execution. Henry inherited Thomas's titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward's sonEdward III of England.  - Elizabeth Woodville (also spelled Wydville, Wydeville, or Widvile; c. 1437  8 June 1492) was Queen consort of England as the spouse of King Edward IV from 1464 until his death in 1483. At the time of her birth, her family was mid-ranked in the English aristocracy. Her first marriage was to a minor supporter of the House of Lancaster, Sir John Grey of Groby; he died at the Second Battle of St Albans, leaving Elizabeth a widowed mother of two sons. Her second marriage, to Edward IV, was a cause célèbre of the day, thanks to Elizabeth's great beauty and lack of great estates. Edward was only the second king of England since the Norman Conquest to have married one of his subjects, and Elizabeth was the first such consort to be crowned queen. Her marriage greatly enriched her siblings and children, but their advancement incurred the hostility of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, 'The Kingmaker', and his various alliances with the most senior figures in the increasingly divided royal family.

Given the question: Process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust -   Question: suppose less sugar is used happens, how will it affect MORE rust forming.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"The question seems to be asking about the effect of using less sugar on the formation of rust. However, sugar is not a component involved in the rusting process, so its presence or absence will not directly influence the formation of rust. To clarify the rust formation process, let's review the steps mentioned: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together. 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust. Given that sugar is not involved in any of the steps above, using less sugar will have no direct effect on the formation of more or less rust. However, it's still essential to understand that in specific environments, reducing the presence of certain substances like sugar can have indirect effects on corrosion. For example, if the environment where iron is placed contains high levels of sugar, and this attracts moisture from the air or encourages the growth of microorganisms, it could indirectly increase the rate of rust formation. By reducing the amount of sugar in such an environment, the indirect promoting factors mentioned above may decrease, which could in turn potentially slow down the rusting process. However, this would not be due to the direct interaction of sugar with the iron or the rust itself. In conclusion, the answer to the question is that using less sugar will likely have no direct effect on the formation of more or less rust, as sugar is not part of the chemical process that leads to rust. However, it is important to consider any indirect effects that the presence of sugar could have on the environment surrounding the iron, which could, in turn, influence the rusting process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The Metropolitan Police has commissioned an independent review into how it responds to people with mental health conditions.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Independent Review into Metropolitan Police's Response to Mental Health Conditions: A Crucial Step Towards Better Policing Introduction The Metropolitan Police has recently announced the commission of an independent review into its approach to dealing with individuals suffering from mental health conditions. This move signifies a much-needed effort towards ensuring the well-being of the public while maintaining efficient law enforcement practices. Background Over the years, there have been numerous cases of people with mental health conditions encountering law enforcement officers during times of crisis. These interactions, in some instances, have tragically resulted in injuries, fatalities, and overall negative experiences for both parties involved. As a result, the Metropolitan Police's decision to commission a comprehensive review presents an opportunity to enhance existing police guidelines and training, while improving the overall understanding of mental health issues in the force. Significance of the Independent Review The review aims to examine the current policies and practices within the Metropolitan Police as they pertain to individuals with mental health concerns. Several factors make this review a significant and timely undertaking: 1. Ensuring fairness and accountability - By soliciting an objective analysis of their existing protocols, The Metropolitan Police demonstrates their commitment to transparency and accountability. This is a vital step in building trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. 2. Reducing stigma around mental health - People with mental health conditions often face discrimination, prejudice, and marginalization. The review aims to ensure that law enforcement officers are educated about mental health conditions, which can help reduce stigma and promote understanding. 3. Enhancing officer training - Inadequate training is often cited as a contributing factor in poor outcomes when officers interact with individuals experiencing mental health crises. By identifying gaps in current training programs and recommending improvements, the review can drastically enhance officer preparedness for such encounters. 4. Identifying best practices - The independent nature of the review ensures that the evaluators can consult with experts and draw from evidence-based practices to determine the most effective approaches for dealing with mental health issues in policing contexts. 5. Promoting community collaboration - The review process fosters collaboration between law enforcement agencies, mental health service providers, and communities. This multi-sectoral partnership has the potential to improve police response to mental health crises and ensure that individuals receive appropriate care and resources. Potential Recommendations and Outcomes While it is too soon to predict the specific recommendations that will arise from this review, it is anticipated that several areas will be addressed: 1. Crisis intervention training - Expanded training in de-escalation techniques, understanding mental health disorders, and recognizing signs of mental health crises is an essential component to improving police response. 2. Mental health resources for law enforcement personnel - Provisions for the well-being of officers, who often experience stress and trauma themselves, must also be considered. Ensuring that police personnel have access to mental health support can greatly impact their ability to effectively serve the community. 3. Collaborative partnerships - Strengthening coordination between law enforcement and mental health service providers, such as crisis response teams and specialized mental health units, can foster more accurate assessments and targeted interventions. 4. Policy review and development - Amending or developing new policies related to the use of force, communication strategies, and crisis management can provide officers with clearer guidelines for managing sensitive situations. Conclusion In conclusion, the independent review commissioned by The Metropolitan Police is a critical step forward in addressing the complex challenges of mental health in law enforcement. This in-depth analysis and exploration of best practices have the potential to significantly enhance the support provided to individuals experiencing mental health crises while ensuring the safety and effectiveness of police officers. By fostering better understanding and collaboration, the outcomes of this review can pave the way for more empathetic and effective policing in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: How do I chop the onions ? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"Chopping onions may seem like a daunting task, especially when you see skilled chefs doing it quickly and efficiently on television. However, by following these simple steps, you can easily chop an onion like a pro. First and foremost, gather the necessary tools and materials for this task, including a sharp knife, a cutting board, and the onion you want to chop. 1. Prepare the onion: Start by removing any loose or dirty outer layers of the onion, ensuring it is clean and ready for use. Rinse the onion under cold running water to remove any dirt or debris. 2. Cut off the ends: Place the onion on the cutting board with its root end facing you. With your sharp knife, carefully slice off about 1/4 inch from the top (non-root) end, creating a flat, stable surface. Do not cut into the onion too deeply, as you want to leave the root end intact to help hold the onion together while chopping. 3. Halve the onion: Rotate the onion so that the recently cut end is facing away from you, and the root end is towards you. It's essential to keep your fingers tucked safely away from the knife as you work. Carefully slice down through the center of the onion, making sure you cut through the root end as well. At this point, you should have two onion halves. 4. Remove the outer layer: Peel the onion by gently lifting the outer layer from one half and peeling it away, revealing the fresh onion layers beneath. Do the same for the other half. 5. Make vertical cuts: With the root end of one onion half still facing towards you, and pressing down on the onion with your non-dominant hand, make a series of narrow vertical cuts into the onion, starting from the top (non-root) end towards the root end. However, do not cut all the way through the root. The distance between each cut depends on how finely you want the onion to be chopped. 6. Make horizontal cuts: Now make 1-2 horizontal cuts into the side of the onion, being careful not to cut through the root. Hold the onion firmly with your non-dominant hand, keeping your fingers curled for safety. 7. Chop the onion: With the root end still facing towards you, hold the onion firmly and begin slicing downward through the previous cuts, starting from the non-root end, moving toward the root end. As the knife goes through the onion, small chopped pieces should begin to fall onto the cutting board. The size of the chopped onion pieces will depend on the spacing of your earlier cuts. Make sure to use a rocking or slicing motion with your knife for easier cutting. 8. Finishing touches: When you have chopped about three-quarters of the onion, you may notice that the root end gets wobbly and difficult to chop. At this point, lay the remaining onion portion on the cutting board, with the flat side facing down, and continue chopping until it becomes too difficult or unstable, at which point it's best to discard the remaining bit with the root end. 9. Repeat: Repeat the process for the second half of the onion. Once both halves are chopped, use your knife to make any necessary adjustments to the size of the onion pieces, if desired. 10. Store or use: Finally, either use the freshly chopped onions immediately in your cooking or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for later use. Be mindful that onions may cause other foods in the fridge to absorb their odor. It is best to store chopped onions in a well-sealed container or plastic wrap. By following these steps, you can chop onions efficiently and safely, making it easier than ever to include this versatile ingredient in your cooking. Whether you're making a salad, sautéing vegetables, or creating a tasty sauce, having properly chopped onions at your disposal will lead to better, more consistent results in the kitchen."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Summarize the following: If you're tackling the move by yourself, then you'll need to arrange to pick up a removals van on the morning of the move. Make this arrangement well in advance, or it may be tricky to hire a van exactly when you want it for a reasonable price during a busy moving season. Compare the prices of a few companies before making your decision. Get there early to avoid waiting in a queue on a busy moving day. Packing your moving truck won't be a big challenge if you plan in advance and have the help of a few trusted friends when you do it. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you pack your moving truck:  Remember that you will need at least two people to handle things other than lifting and hauling. They will need to organize the things that need to be loaded by keeping the packed boxes close to the door easily accessible. Disassemble your furniture. Take apart any lamps, tables with removable legs, bookshelves, and entertainment systems. Protect your furniture. Wrap all of your items with packing paper, bubblewrap and tape as you load them into the truck. Load the heaviest items first, into the back of the truck. This includes your fridge, washer, dryer, and other appliances, as well as your heaviest boxes. Load the heaviest boxes. Stack them like bricks to form layers of walls that fill the back of the truck. Use T-stacks to make the boxes more stable: make each vertical seam make a T with the horizontal layer below it, like bricks in a house. Avoid vertical pillars of similar sized boxes. To maximize space, it is essential to stack high, stable walls early on. Next, load your longer items into the truck. This includes your bed and shelves. Lean them against the sides of the truck. Pack your remaining boxes into the truck. Create three layers of boxes which includes the heaviest boxes on the bottom, the medium-sized boxes in the middle, and the lightest boxes on top. Once you're done with each layer, tape it together with packing tape. Put in your remaining items. The trick is to make everything fit snugly together, but don't pack it so tight that it looks ready to explode. When using the ramp of a box van, such as the vans pictured, make sure the ramp has been fitted into place: once you have fully extended the ramp from under the truck, you will find two prongs that will fit into slots on the lip of the van's cargo space. This will ensure that the ramp is flush with the lip, and make it a breeze to use the dolly. This step is often overlooked. Make sure the dolly is one of the last things to get loaded, so you will have it as soon as you arrive at the new house. Carefully drive the truck to your new home. Be prepared to drive slower and more carefully than you would do in a car. Driving a moving truck takes a big adjustment. Remember to go slowly and stay calm, because the drive may be stressful. If at all possible, back the truck up to the new house so that the ramp will extend onto the porch. Use all of your crew as spotters to make sure you are clear of any obstacles. When you are close to the porch, extend the ramp and hook it in place, and have a crew member carry the opposite end. Most ramps will not latch properly unless the end is on the ground. Once you have the ramp set up, here's how you can unload your stuff:  Have a plan for where you're going to put the large items in each room.  Do a walk through with the movers, and show them where the larger items go, such as the sofas, TV, cabinets, beds, dressers, night-stands, etc. Choose where to put the boxes and small items in each room based on that.  That way the boxes won't be in the way when the big furniture comes in.  And you won't have to move the boxes again.  You can put Post-it notes on the wall if necessary. You will have arranged whether you will do this the same day or the next morning. Summary:","output":"When moving by yourself, it is important to arrange for a removals van ahead of time, comparing prices and ensuring availability. On the moving day, have at least two people to help with organizing and packing the truck. Disassemble furniture and protect items with packing materials. Load the heaviest items first, followed by stacking boxes like bricks to create stable walls. Incorporate longer items and complete the box layers with the lightest items on top. Secure each layer with packing tape. When using a ramp, ensure it is fitted properly and keep the dolly accessible for unloading. Drive the truck carefully and slowly to your new home, using crew members as spotters. Back the truck up to the new house, extend the ramp, and secure it in place. Plan the placement of large items in each room and use Post-it notes to indicate their positions. Unload your items carefully and efficiently, with attention to the placement of boxes and small items. This can be done the same day or the next morning, depending on your arrangement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Beijing, April 2----Starting from this year, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau will begin to promote a home medical service. With this service a medical team which is made up of a doctor, a nurse and a medical health worker will be sent to some communities in the city. They will set up a medical filing recorder for every resident in community and publicize their contact information to them. If people in the community feel sick, they can consult their community doctor first. If community doctors cannot treat their illness, they will then be transferred to large hospitals. Liang Wan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, made the statement last Friday . In addition ,the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau will set up some funds to train home medical service workers for families whose members suffer either from high blood pressure, diabetes,cerebral apoplexy , or coronary heart disease . The home medical service workers will remind patients to take pills on time and lead the patients to follow some health tips in their daily life. They will also learn some practical knowledge to save patients in case of an emergency . The work will first begin in the medical service room in the 25 community centers and spread to all communities in Beijing. The disease prevention and control centers at various counties and districts in Beijing will be responsible for teaching community doctors and giving home medical service lectures, or advice . These workers will not be able to work until they pass related examination and obtain the work certificates. It is expected that by the end of this year, there will be 10000 home medical service workers in Beijing . Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? - The medical team which is made up of a doctor, a nurse and a medical health worker will set up a medical filing record for every resident. - The home medical service workers not only give some healthy suggestions to the patients, but also learn practical knowledge about first aid. - Some funds will be provided by Beijing Municipal Health Bureau for home medical service training. - The government aims to offer the home medical service for free.

Let's see, if we have 48 candies and we eat 53, we'll be short of 5 candies, right? So 48 - 53 will be -5. Now, our problem is 2*s = s - 5. Since we want to find out what 's' is, let's move all 's' terms to one side, and numbers to the other side. Let's take 's' away from both sides of the equal sign, like this: 2*s - s = s - 5 - s That will leave us with: 1*s = -5 (since 2*s - s = 1*s and s - 5 - s = -5) So now we know that 's' is equal to -5.

It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. The paragraph-long \\"plot summary\\" written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly backing it up to see what details I had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on. Alas, to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story, if you could call it a story. It's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations. Newsflash to the the creators: I paid to watch you MAKE a movie. I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is somebody I've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. Next time you produce something, don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, I hate to say it, but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs.

Wikileaks dump appears to show DNC favored Clinton campaign A new trove of leaked emails seem to show that top officials at the Democratic National Committee openly mocked and criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary race against Hillary Clinton -- a startling revelation that raises questions about the Democratic Party’s impartiality and an issue that could play out poorly at the party’s convention this week in Philadelphia. Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED WikiLeaks posted close to 20,000 emails and 8,000 attachments Friday sent or received from top Democratic officials that seem to suggest the committee’s chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other higher ups tried to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor. WikiLeaks dubbed the document dump the “Hillary Leaks series.” Sanders has repeatedly claimed that he thought the system was “rigged” during the primaries. RELEASE: 19,252 emails from the US Democratic National Committee https://t.co/kpFxYDoNyX #Hillary2016 #FeelTheBern pic.twitter.com/Pft8wnOujl Republican candidate Donald Trump weighed in Saturday morning, tweeting: “Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes (sic), really vicious. RIGGED.” The leaks, from January 2015 to May 2016, purportedly came the from accounts of seven DNC officials and feature conversations by staffers debating everything from how to deal with media requests to syncing the party’s message with interest groups in Washington. The officials are: Senior Adviser Andrew Wright, National Finance Director Jordan Kaplan, Finance Chief of Staff Scott Comer, Communications Director Luis Miranda, Northern California Finance Director Robert Stowe, Finance Director of Data & Strategic Initiatives Daniel Parrish and Finance Director Allen Zachary. In one email, DNC staffers were looking for ways to blunt Sanders’ popularity with Democrats. In a May 5 email, a DNC employee asked a colleague to collect information on his religious beliefs – claiming it might sway voters in West Virginia and Kentucky. In that particular email, Sanders name was not mentioned but he was the only other candidate in the race at that time against Clinton. DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall wrote, “This would make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.” Stephen Hayes, a columnist at the Weekly Standard, told “Special Report” on Fox News that the emails show a clear pattern of Wasserman Schultz and the DNC “thumbing the scales’ in favor of Clinton and scheming for ways to “thwart” Sanders. A May 15, 2016 email, shows the DNC was in close contact with news websites on articles related to the Democratic Party, Sanders and Clinton. A Real Clear Politics article claimed that Sanders supporters are causing a lack of unity at the Democratic National Convention. Wasserman Schultz took issue with the headline and told another Democratic official the “headline needs to be changed.” What followed was a back and forth between DNC officials to pressure Real Clear Politics to change their story. The last email on the thread between DNC officials reads, “Done. Article has been updated.” The Real Clear Politics story headline was corrected to reflect that the incident in question involved the Nevada state convention and not the national one. Calls by FoxNews.com to the DNC for comment were not immediately returned.

Information:  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Stian Aarstad is a Norwegian pianist and keyboard player best known for his five - year ( 1992 -- 97 ) stint with the black metal band Dimmu Borgir during which he played keyboards and synthesizers while engendering criticism and controversy for appearing onstage and performing in a top - hat - and - cape outfit reminiscent of Jack the Ripper , while wearing minimal corpse makeup and not moving or showing any emotion . Upon joining Dimmu Borgir , he did n't listen to metal music , preferring only to listen to classical . In 1998 to 1999 , he produced a demo - EP for the unblack metal band Vaakevandring . In the 2000s , Aarstad had been the pianist for the band Enthral , but left his regular position during the recording of the band 's third album .  - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member.  - Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The name \\"Jack the Ripper\\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The killer was called \\"the Whitechapel Murderer\\" as well as \\"Leather Apron\\" within the crime case files, as well as in contemporary journalistic accounts.  - Whitechapel is a district in the East End of London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Dimmuborgir (\\"dimmu\\" \\"dark\\", \\"borgir\\" \\"cities\\" or \\"forts\\", \\"castles\\"); pronounced ) is a large area of unusually shaped lava fields east of Mývatn in Iceland.

The term is most often used in reference to \\"burial sheets\\", mound shroud, grave clothes, winding-cloths or winding-sheets, such as the famous Shroud of Turin or \\"Tachrichim\\" (burial shrouds) that Jews are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white cotton, wool or linen, though any material can be used so long as it is made of natural fibre. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden, a proscription that ultimately derives from the Torah, \\"viz.\\", Deut. 22:11.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder.  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - A vampire is a being from folklore who subsists by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term \\"vampire\\" was not popularized in the West until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as \\"shtriga\\" in Albania, \\"vrykolakas\\" in Greece and \\"strigoi\\" in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809  October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.  - Amelia Holt Atwater-Rhodes (born April 16, 1984), known professionally as Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, is an American author of fantasy and young adult literature.  - In the Forests of the Night is a vampire novel written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and published in 1999. Originally entitled White Wine, she wrote it at the age of thirteen. The book was published on May 11, 1999, about a month after she turned fifteen. It is the first novel in the Den of Shadows. It tells the story of a three-hundred-year-old vampire named Risika and her struggles throughout her life, both before and after she was transformed. The novel is told in first-person narrative by the protagonist, Risika. It was well received by critics.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - The undead are beings in mythology, legend, or fiction that are deceased but behave as if alive. A common example of an undead being is a corpse re-animated by supernatural forces, by the application of the deceased's own life force, or that of another being (such as a demon).  The undead may be incorporeal like ghosts, or corporeal like vampires and zombies. The undead are featured in the belief systems of most cultures, and appear in many works of fantasy and horror fiction. The term is also occasionally used for putative non-supernatural cases of re-animation, from early experiments like Robert E. Cornish's to future sciences such as cryonics and chemical brain preservation.    What is the relationship between 'demon in my view' and 'den of shadows'? Answer:","output":"Demon in My View is the follow-up novel to In the Forests of the Night, both written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. These two novels are part of a larger series called the Den of Shadows. The Den of Shadows series is a collection of young adult vampire novels that revolve around the supernatural, focusing on both the mythical creatures and the human interactions with them. In the Forests of the Night introduces readers to the character Risika, a three-hundred-year-old vampire, and her struggles and experiences throughout her life. The novel is told from Risika's first-person perspective and sets the tone for the rest of the series with its dark, supernatural elements and themes. Demon in My View follows the same supernatural theme but introduces new characters and a different storyline. This novel focuses on Jessica, a teenage girl who writes about a vampire named Aubrey, only to soon discover that her fiction is closer to reality than she initially realized. As the story unfolds, the worlds of the supernatural and the ordinary entwine, creating a thrilling and fast-paced plot. The relationship between Demon in My View and the Den of Shadows series is that they are both novels set in the same universe and explore the intertwined lives of humans and supernatural beings. While each book in the series can be read as a stand-alone story, they share common themes, settings, and occasionally intertwining storylines, which create a distinctive atmosphere and style that has become a hallmark of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's writing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

En el Blond Ambition World Tour figuró en el segundo acto del concierto, donde la escenografía simulaba una iglesia. Madonna lucía un conjunto negro descrito como «un cruce entre el atuendo de una viuda mediterránea y una túnica de clero». En la actuación se arrodillaba ante una plataforma repleta de velas votivas mientras sus bailarines y coristas, que iban vestidos de sacerdotes y monjas, entonaban la frase Oh my god! varias veces. Seguido de esto se quitaba una bufanda negra de la cabeza y mostraba un enorme crucifijo colgando de su cuello.

They earn extra money by making professional home videos for people. Cheryl becomes interested in films from the 1930s and 40s which feature black actresses. She notices that these actresses are often not credited. She watches a film called Plantation Memories with a black actress who is credited simply as \\"The Watermelon Woman\\". Cheryl decides to make a documentary about the Watermelon Woman and find out more about her life. Tamara tries to set Cheryl up with her friend Yvette, but Cheryl is not interested. Cheryl meets a white woman in the store called Diana who, to Tamara's annoyance, flirts with Cheryl. Cheryl starts interviewing members of the public, asking them if they have heard of the Watermelon Woman. She interviews her mother who does not remember the name, but recognises a photograph of her.

Bananas are a nutritious and energy-rich food source for monkeys and many other animals, including humans. When a monkey grabs a banana, it does so primarily to gain the nutrients it needs to maintain its health and well-being. Bananas are an excellent source of carbohydrates, which provide energy for a monkey's daily activities. They also contain a good amount of dietary fiber, which supports the monkey's digestive system and helps maintain regular bowel movements. Moreover, bananas are packed with essential vitamins and minerals. For instance, they are high in vitamins C and B6, which play crucial roles in maintaining a healthy immune system and supporting brain function. They also contain potassium, which helps regulate the balance of fluids within the monkey's body and supports normal muscle and nerve function. In conclusion, a monkey grabs a banana to consume its numerous nutrients, which help it maintain good health, obtain energy for its daily activities, and thrive in its environment.

The rise was mainly due to more people identifying as bisexual, the Office for National Statistics said, up from 1.3% in 2014 to 1.8% last year. Rights charity Stonewall said that may in part be a result of more LGB role models in the public eye. It named model and actress Cara Delevigne, boxer Nicola Adams and singer Miley Cyrus among high-profile people to come out as bisexual in recent years. The ONS's sexual identity data comes from its Annual Population Survey. Sexual identity is one part of the concept of \\"sexual orientation\\", which does not necessarily reflect sexual attraction or sexual behaviour, the ONS said. It currently does not measure sexual attraction or sexual behaviour. Other findings showed: Lana Peswani, 24, first had feelings towards women when she was a young child but says she didn't know at the time what they meant. She was bullied in her all-girls secondary school by students who called her a lesbian. However, it was when she was 17 that she heard the term pansexual for the first time and realised it applied to her. Pansexuality is a term used to describe those who can feel an attraction to anyone, regardless of their sex or gender. Miss Peswani, who lives in London, has had relationships with men and women, and said: \\"I feel my attraction to people is quite fluid. \\"I fancy guys, girls and trans people, and I find androgyny attractive. It's more about the person and the energy they give.\\" She added: \\"I think the younger generation are a lot more open. They are aware of things like trans issues. \\"At my school people weren't aware of trans issues at all.\\" A spokeswoman for Stonewall welcomed the figures and said there were now more LGB role models in the media and more open discussions in society about bisexuality. She said: \\"We would hope that individuals who had previously felt pressured to conceal their bi identity now feel safer and more empowered to be open about how they identify. \\"It's a shame the data doesn't account for those who identify outside of the binaries of lesbian, gay and bi, however. \\"We know that many LGBT people prefer not to label their sexual orientation in such a way, and so their input in this research is lost.\\" Some 320,000 are polled each year for the Annual Population Survey, from which individual reports are published throughout the year.

The portion of the LGB youth population rose from 2.8% in 2014 to 3.3% in 2015, equating to about 242,000 people. The increase was largely due to more individuals identifying as bisexual, increasing from 1.3% in 2014 to 1.8% the following year.  The rise in bisexuality identification has been partly attributed to the increasing presence of LGB figures in public discourse. High-profile personalities such as model-actress Cara Delevigne, professional boxer Nicola Adams, and singer Miley Cyrus, who have publicly identified as bisexual in recent years, are identified by the rights charity Stonewall as the potential role models influencing this trend.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

Their list of rums is quite impressive so if you are a connoisseur then you simply must go here.  They have a menu of fun signature cocktails that were mostly tropical themed... it sort of reminded me of Hula's Modern Tiki Bar in that respect but in this case the rums really are the main focus and any fruit juice or other mixers are meant to enhance and highlight the flavor of the rum itself.  The first one I tried was the Spicy Rumtini which was really delicious, though I expected more heat.

Now don't get me wrong, I am well aware that CPH mixes up the best cocktails on the planet.  But I just happened to like this particular drink here at the Rum Bar better.  One of my companions said it was because of the type of rum they use (Goslings).  The cocktails were all 8 or 9 and their wines were 10 a glass (but they had Dos Cabezas, yay!) so because of that this would never be someplace I would come drink on a regular basis.

Naina is shocked by the revelation, and Aman tries to cover up his lie by involving Priya in his plan. Meanwhile, Aman vows to win Naina back before her wedding to Ravi. Step 4: Complications Aman attempts to sabotage Ravi and Naina's relationship, but his plans only end up revealing his love for Naina. Priya, initially reluctant to be a part of Aman's deception, starts to develop genuine feelings for him, complicating the situation further. Step 5: Climax As the day of Ravi and Naina's wedding approaches, Aman realizes that he must come clean about his feelings. He declares his love for Naina in front of the entire town, admitting that his marriage to Priya was a lie. Naina is overwhelmed with emotions and finally reveals that she has always loved Aman but chose to stay silent to maintain their friendship. Step 6: Resolution Naina and Ravi call off their engagement, and Naina moves forward with Aman. Instead of being heartbroken, Priya is grateful to Aman for helping her understand the importance of honesty and vulnerability in relationships. The movie ends with Aman and Naina starting a new chapter in their lives, promising to be open and honest with each other from now on. In summary, the answer is: Aman claims to be married to Priya in order to hide his feelings for Naina. Through the course of the movie, Aman must confront his fear of vulnerability and risk losing his best friend in order to attain the love he has always desired."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: Plant circadian rhythms tell the plant what season it is and when to flower for the best chance of attracting pollinators. Behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, enzyme activity, photosynthetic activity, and fragrance emission, among others. Circadian rhythms occur as a plant entrains to synchronize with the light cycle of its surrounding environment. These rhythms are endogenously generated and self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops: proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions. Anticipation of changes in the environment allows appropriate changes in a plant's physiological state, conferring an adaptive advantage. A better understanding of plant circadian rhythms has applications in agriculture, such as helping farmers stagger crop harvests to extend crop availability and securing against massive losses due to weather. Now answer this question: What is the plant expression of circadian rhythm?","output":"The plant expression of circadian rhythm refers to the various physiological and biochemical processes in plants that exhibit a roughly 24-hour cycle. These processes are endogenously controlled and can be entrained by external environmental cues, such as light and temperature. Circadian rhythms in plants play a crucial role in their life cycle, growth, reproduction, and survival, as they enable the plants to anticipate daily and seasonal changes in their environment and optimize their physiological responses accordingly. Key expressions of plant circadian rhythms include: 1. Leaf movement: Many plants exhibit rhythmic leaf movement, such as opening during the day and closing at night, as a response to light and temperature changes. This movement helps maximize photosynthesis and minimize water loss through transpiration. 2. Growth: The growth rate of plants, including stem elongation and root growth, can show daily fluctuations that coincide with the circadian rhythm. This allows plants to allocate resources and adjust their growth patterns based on environmental cues. 3. Germination: Seed germination timing is regulated by the plant's internal clock to ensure the best possible conditions for growth and survival. Certain stages in the germination process have been found to follow a circadian rhythm. 4. Stomatal/gas exchange: Stomata are the tiny pores on plant leaves responsible for gas exchange. Their opening and closing are regulated by the circadian rhythm, helping plants efficiently manage gas exchange, photosynthesis, and water loss throughout the day. 5. Enzyme activity: Many metabolic processes in plants are regulated through the activity of specific enzymes that operate on a circadian schedule. Examples include enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake. 6. Photosynthetic activity: The rate of photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, exhibits a daily rhythm influenced by the circadian clock. This rhythm helps plants optimize their energy capture and storage depending on the time of day and the availability of light. 7. Fragrance emission: Some plants emit fragrances in a rhythmic manner that aligns with their circadian clock. This may correlate with the time of day when pollinators, such as insects, are most active, thereby increasing the chance of successful pollination and reproduction. By understanding the plant expression of circadian rhythms, researchers can develop strategies to optimize plant growth, increase agricultural productivity, and improve crop resistance to environmental stressors. This knowledge can help farmers make informed decisions, such as staggering crop harvests, to extend the availability of fresh produce and protect against crop losses due to unfavorable weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 42-year-old inmate was executed yesterday evening for the 2002 killing of a police officer and another man during a meth-fueled shooting rampage at a Dallas-area gas station, the Huffington Post reports. The state was down to its last dose of the execution drug last month, but it has managed to obtain several more shots from a compounding pharmacy and will be able to carry out three more scheduled executions this month, San Angelo Live reports. There are at least three more executions scheduled in the state for May and June, reports the AP, and corrections officials say they're looking at other options, including using other drugs or finding fresh sources of pentobarbital. Before he was executed, Sprouse apologized to the victims' families and to his own family \\"for all the trouble I have caused them,\\" WFAA reports. After the execution, the widow of slain officer Marty Steinfeldt issued a statement saying it was the \\"emotional end of a long, excruciating journey.\\" She was pregnant when the 28-year-old officer was killed and gave birth to their daughter several months afterward, reports WFAA. (The American Pharmacists Association has urged members not to sell execution drugs.)","output":"Once upon a time in Texas, a man named Kent Sprouse did some very wrong things. In 2002, he hurt two people really badly because he was using a not-good thing called meth. He was caught and put in a place called prison. After a long time, the people in charge said it was time for him to go to sleep forever to make things right. They used a special sleep drug called pentobarbital. The people in Texas used to have just a little bit of this drug, but they got more of it to make sure they could make other people go to sleep forever when it's time too. There are more people like Kent who have to go to sleep forever, so the Texas people are making plans to make sure they have enough of the sleep drug. Before Kent went to sleep forever, he said sorry to the families he hurt and to his own family for making them sad. The wife of one of the men Kent hurt said she feels like a big, sad journey is over because of what happened. When her husband went away, she was going to have a baby, and now their little girl is all grown up. There's a group of people who make and sell drugs like these, called the American Pharmacists Association. They don't want people to sell the forever-sleep drug, which has made it a little harder for places like Texas to find it.

Question 1: Why do countries like India and China not take part in the war against ISIS? Question 2: Is Taiwan part of or separate from China? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will provide information and analysis on each subject. Question 1: Why do countries like India and China not take part in the war against ISIS? Step 1: Understand the core issue The user is asking about the reasons for India and China's lack of direct involvement in the war against ISIS. Step 2: Identify the main actors and their stance ISIS, or the Islamic State, has been at the center of an international military coalition composed of Western and Middle Eastern countries. India and China, despite their significant global influence, have not taken part in this military intervention directly. Step 3: Analyze the reasons for their stance There are several reasons for India and China's non-involvement: 1. National priorities: Both countries have different national priorities and security concerns, such as border disputes and domestic terrorism, which may take precedence over joining the military campaign against ISIS. 2. Limited direct threat: While India and China have experienced terrorist attacks from groups affiliated with ISIS, the direct threat from the group's core operations in Iraq and Syria has been comparatively low. 3. Relation with other countries: Both countries maintain complex relationships with regional players involved in the conflict, including Russia, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Direct involvement in the war against ISIS could alter these delicate balances of power and diplomacy. 4. Non-interventionist foreign policies: India and China generally adhere to non-interventionist foreign policies that emphasize supporting diplomatic solutions over military intervention. Question 2: Is Taiwan part of or separate from China? Step 1: Understand the core issue The user is asking about Taiwan's political status and whether it is part of China or a separate entity. Step 2: Identify historical context After the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, while the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established on the Chinese mainland. Step 3: Analyze the current situation Currently, the \\"One China\\" policy emphasizes that there is only one sovereign state named \\"China\\" and that Taiwan is a part of that state. Most countries, including the United States, officially recognize the PRC as the legitimate government of China, although some maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan. Taiwan operates as a separate, democratic political entity with its own government and economy but faces pressure from the PRC to one day reunify under the \\"One China\\" policy. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. The first question concerns the foreign policies and priorities of India and China, specifically their approach to the war against ISIS. The second question is about Taiwan's political status and its relationship with China. While both questions involve China and touch upon political complexities and international relations, the subject matter and analysis for each question are distinct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences essentially convey the same information, although they differ slightly in the wording and presentation. Here's a detailed breakdown of both sentences: 1. The Intel C++ Compiler for Platform Builder for Microsoft .NET is available for the suggested list price of 1,499 and is intended for OEM and system integrator use. In this sentence, the subject is the Intel C++ Compiler, specifically the version designed with Platform Builder for Microsoft .NET in mind. This sentence explicitly states that the suggested list price for the compiler is 1,499. The intended audience for this compiler is listed as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and system integrators, indicating that this product is geared towards professionals who design, develop, and implement systems. 2. The Intel C++ Compiler for Platform Builder for Microsoft Windows CE.Net is available for 1,499 and is intended for use by device manufacturers and systems integrators. Similarly, the second sentence also focuses on the Intel C++ Compiler, this time mentioning the Microsoft Windows CE.Net platform. It provides the same price of 1,499 and targets a similar audience, consisting of device manufacturers and systems integrators. Device manufacturers are a category that encompasses OEMs because they are responsible for producing hardware components and devices. Consequently, the target audience implicitly includes OEMs despite not being explicitly mentioned. In summary, both sentences discuss the Intel C++ Compiler for specific Microsoft platforms, with the same price tag of 1,499. Additionally, both sentences highlight that the compiler is intended for industry professionals such as device manufacturers, OEMs, and systems integrators, who are responsible for creating, implementing, and operating complex systems.

This article: Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the march that Kevin Maguire calls, \\"a heroic failure\\"?, what is it ? A:","output":"The full name of the march that Kevin Maguire calls \\"a heroic failure\\" is the Jarrow Crusade or Jarrow March. This event took place in 1936, when around 200 unemployed workers marched from Jarrow to London to raise awareness about the dire unemployment and poverty situation in their town, with the hope of creating job opportunities. The marchers sought the support of the British government to revive the local economy and reduce unemployment, but despite their efforts, the immediate impact was limited, leading to it being described as a \\"heroic failure.\\" However, the march played a significant role in shaping public opinion and eventually contributed to social reforms after the Second World War."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Copeland has stated that he has never met, nor ever seen a picture of, his father. He became interested in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. Copeland resides in Asheville, North Carolina. Copeland used to play hockey with retired National Hockey League (NHL) player Aaron Downey. He is a fan of the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils. He is close friends with fellow wrestler Jason Reso, otherwise known as Christian.  Copeland has several tattoos: a red and black sun on his left upper biceps, which covers a tattoo of a muscular shark which resembled the Street Sharks; a star on his right upper biceps with several smaller stars and two skulls wearing bandanas, adorned with flowers and hearts, below said star tattoo; a tattoo of a cross on his left forearm; and another tattoo of a scroll like piece of paper adorned with the words \\"Rise Above\\". All of Copeland's tattoos represent a stage in his career. His sun, which Copeland got while recovering from his neck injury, represents \\"looking towards brighter days.\\" The cross tattoo represents his time with the Brood, and his star and skull tattoos represent his Rated-R Superstar persona and his self-proclaimed status as the \\"Guns N' Roses of wrestling\\".  In March 2007, Copeland became a key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its continuing series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.  According to a Sports Illustrated article rotated on August 30, 2007, Copeland was named one of ten wrestlers found to have purchased steroids and other drugs from an online pharmacy, a violation of the WWE Talent Wellness program. Copeland was said to have received somatropin, genotropin, and stanozolol between September 2004 and February 2007.  In 1998, Copeland began a relationship with Alannah Morley, the sister of Sean Morley (aka Val Venis), and they married on November 8, 2001. They divorced a few years later on March 10, 2004. His second marriage was to Lisa Ortiz on October 21, 2004. Soon after his second marriage, Copeland started an affair with Amy Dumas (aka Lita), and their relationship became public knowledge in February 2005, resulting in Copeland's divorce from Ortiz on November 17, 2005. On December 12, 2013, Copeland and former WWE wrestler Beth Phoenix had a daughter, and named her Lyric Rose Copeland.

Paragraph: For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

It would provide affordable space for start-up firms and have links with the university's academic programme. Through that, students, academics and businesses would be brought together to share expertise and explore new ideas for growth. Once a business has outgrown the space provided in the box village, it can then be accommodated in an \\"innovation precinct\\" with academic support of the university's business and management department. Prof Medwin Hughes, the university's vice-chancellor, said the box village and the innovation precinct would help to grow new businesses, develop the skills of current ones and attract new investment into the region. \\"Through such activities the university will create new opportunities for employment, helping to generate more footfall and spending in the city centre and to retain some of the brightest entrepreneurial talents,\\" he added. A phased 215,000 sq ft (20,000 sq m) development would consist of a series of hubs with a focus on the university's academic programme. The aim is to create opportunities for the development of new businesses, products and services. Hub examples: Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said the box village would allow entrepreneurs to \\"flourish and expand\\".

Write a title: India #39;s ruling Congress party, flush with an election win in the state that is the heart of finance and film, will now be better armed to deal with demanding communist allies, newspapers and analysts said on Sunday.","output":"Title: \\"India's Congress Party Bolsters Power: Triumph in Financial and Cinematic Hub Empowers Negotiations with Communist Allies\\" The recent electoral victory of India's ruling Congress party in the key state for finance and film industries has not only provided a morale boost for the party but also fortified its presence in negotiations with communist allies. As the newspapers and political analysts on Sunday reported, this victory is expected to have far-reaching consequences in shaping the country's political dynamics.  To understand the significance of this win, it is essential to examine the diverse political landscape of India and the role of various political entities. The Congress party, known for its secular, centrist approach, has had to rely on alliances to form and maintain a stable government throughout the years. One such crucial alliance is with the Left Front, comprising several communist parties that advocate for socialism and workers' rights. These parties are often known for their stringent demands and unbending positions on labor issues, foreign policy, and economic reforms. The recent victory of Congress in the state that houses India's financial nerve center and thriving film industry has undoubtedly enhanced their ability to negotiate and govern autonomously. The financial sector, comprising investment banks, financial services companies, and stock exchanges, is significantly impacted by the country's political stability and economic reforms. As such, the Congress party's win demonstrates its commitment to creating a business-friendly environment that fosters growth and investment. Similarly, the film industry holds immense significance in Indian society, spanning regional, linguistic, and cultural spectrums. With this victory, Congress has positioned itself as a supporter of the diverse creative talents and, in turn, garnered favor from various segments of the population. The party's triumph also sends a message of unity and inclusivity, affirming its presence as a responsible and powerful political player in the Indian political arena. As Congress gains momentum, its existing alliance with the left-wing parties will inevitably be affected. With increased credibility and a fortified mandate, the Congress party will likely be more assertive in its stance on key policy issues. Consequently, this could diminish the sway of the communists on policy and force them to re-evaluate their role and expectations within the alliance. As noted by political analysts, the win will likely have a domino effect, with the Congress party's growing stature significantly impacting decisions and negotiations. Though the communist parties have traditionally held considerable influence, Congress's newfound victory might encourage them to adopt a more pragmatic approach to ensure their continued relevance in the political scene. It could prompt them to engage in constructive dialogues and make compromises for the greater good of the nation. While it remains uncertain as to how these dynamics will evolve, there is no doubt that the Congress party's electoral win has sent a strong message. In conclusion, the Congress party's recent victory in the vital financial and cinematic state has fueled its growing influence, equipping it with the ability to challenge and negotiate with its communist allies confidently. Consequently, this will likely reshape India's political landscape by redefining the power dynamics within the ruling alliance, prompting both the Congress party and communist parties to adapt to the new reality. As the significance of this historical win gradually unfolds, it will invariably impact the financial, film, and various other sectors, ultimately shaping India's path to progress and inclusive development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had.

Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would group B able to hear higher or lower frequency than group A?  Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. The answer is:","output":"Group B would be able to hear higher frequency than group A. This is because group A animals can only hear infrasound, which have frequencies below 20 Hz. Group B animals can hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do, which is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Since the lower limit of group B's hearing range (20 Hz) is higher than the frequencies that group A can hear (below 20 Hz), group B is able to hear higher frequencies compared to group A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from the following. a. face extinction b. stagnate c. grow d. hibernate","output":"Answer: a. face extinction As the quality of water in an environment deteriorates, the number of aquatic animals, such as zooplankton, will face extinction. This is because bad water, characterized by high levels of pollution, low dissolved oxygen, and detrimental changes in water chemistry, poses significant challenges to the survival of these organisms. First, polluted water contains various contaminants, including toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and microplastics, which can adversely affect the health and reproductive capacity of aquatic animals. For instance, the bioaccumulation of pollutants in zooplankton can lead to physiological and reproductive disorders, which ultimately disrupt their population dynamics. Second, the decrease in dissolved oxygen levels due to organic pollutant decomposition and eutrophication (an excessive growth of algae due to high nutrient concentrations) can result in oxygen-depleted zones, or \\"dead zones,\\" where aquatic life struggles to survive. Zooplankton, like most aquatic organisms, rely on dissolved oxygen for their respiration. Consequently, these dead zones lead to increased mortality rates and decreased reproduction in zooplankton populations. Lastly, changes in water chemistry, such as alterations in acidity, salinity, or temperature, can further stress aquatic animals, making them more susceptible to diseases, parasites, and other environmental pressures. These changes can also affect the distribution, abundance, and diversity of zooplankton in various aquatic ecosystems, as they may alter the availability of their food sources or trigger behavioural changes. In conclusion, as bad water increases in an environment, the number of aquatic animals such as zooplankton will face extinction. The decline or disappearance of these organisms can have cascading effects on the entire aquatic ecosystem, as zooplankton play a crucial role in the food webs, serving as a primary food source for various marine species, and contribute to nutrient cycling. Therefore, it is essential to mitigate water pollution and monitor water quality to safeguard the health and survival of these valuable and fundamental organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.

We raised her to be mature and handle bad situations with grace . My mom always says not to let it live in your head . What does the speaker 's mother mean when she says not to let it live in your head ?","output":"When the speaker's mother says \\"not to let it live in your head,\\" she implies that one should not dwell on negative thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Holding onto past mistakes, criticisms, or adverse events can create a constant stream of negativity in one's mind, adversely affecting one's mental and emotional well-being. The phrase conveys the importance of acknowledging and learning from setbacks, but not letting them consume one's thoughts and dictate one's actions. By not letting negative events, self-destructive thoughts, or the opinions of others occupy your mind, you can maintain a healthier, more balanced mental state, fostering resilience and better emotional wellbeing. In this context, the speaker reflects on acknowledging their own mistakes and approaching the situation maturely. They appreciate how their daughter was raised to be a mature person who can handle bad situations with grace. The mother's advice serves as a reminder to effectively deal with and learn from one's shortcomings, but not to allow these setbacks to continually affect their thoughts and emotions. To practice not letting things live in your head, apply various techniques such as mindfulness, acceptance, acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes, practicing self-compassion, and focusing on self-improvement. By doing so, you are more likely to maintain a positive outlook on life, allowing you to enjoy a sense of inner peace even when faced with challenging situations.

Do these questions have the same meaning? Who are some lesser known important historical figures of Guyana and what should people know about them? Who are some lesser known important historical figures of India and what should people know about them? Possible answers: 1. no; 2. yes;","output":"1. No These questions do not have the same meaning as they are asking about important historical figures from two different countries, Guyana and India. While the structure of both questions is similar – they both inquire about lesser-known figures and what people should know about them – their focus is distinct, with one question concentrating on Guyana and the other on India. Below are brief descriptions of a few lesser-known historical figures from each country to demonstrate the differences in their historical and cultural significance. Guyana: a) Hubert Nathaniel Critchlow (1884-1958): Known as the 'Father of Trade Unionism' in Guyana, he established the British Guiana Labour Union in 1919. Under his leadership, it became the first labor union in the country, fighting for workers' rights, higher wages, and better working conditions. b) Cuffy (18th century): Also referred to as Kofi, he was an enslaved African man who led a major uprising against slave oppression in the Dutch colony of Berbice, present-day Guyana, in 1763. His rebellion stands as a symbol of Guyanese resistance to enslavement and oppression. c) Janet Jagan (1920-2009): She was an American-born social and political activist who became the first female President of Guyana in 1997. Alongside political activism, she worked to improve healthcare, education, and social welfare in the country. India: a) Rani Velu Nachiyar (1730-1796): She was the first female Indian queen to wage war against the British East India Company. After her husband's death, she organized a successful resistance against British occupation and later formed an alliance with the Maratha Empire. b) Tantia Tope (1814-1859): A prominent leader during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (First War of Indian Independence), Tantia Tope conspired against British colonial rule and aided Rani Lakshmibai in defending Jhansi. He was eventually captured and executed by the British. c) Begum Hazrat Mahal (1820-1879): The queen of Awadh, she played a decisive role in the First War of Indian Independence (1857-1858). Following the exile of her husband, she took over as the ruler of Awadh, forming alliances with other resistance movements, and played a crucial role in organizing a well-orchestrated rebellion against the British. In summary, these questions focus on two different countries with unique cultural and historical contexts. The individuals from Guyana and India mentioned above showcase the varied contributions made by lesser-known historical figures in each respective nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Errol Louis: Mario Cuomo's death a reminder of when a strong liberal mulled presidential run. He says Cuomo's son,  N.Y.'s governor, also eyes presidency. Can liberalism make comeback? Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Mario Cuomo's Legacy and the Potential Resurgence of Liberalism in U.S. Politics Introduction: The recent death of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo has brought back memories of a time when a strong liberal almost made a run for the U.S. presidency. As his son, current New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, is speculated to be eyeing a future presidential bid, it is time to consider if liberalism can make a comeback in today's political landscape. Step 1: Reflect on Mario Cuomo's political career and ideology Mario Cuomo, who served as the 52nd governor of New York from 1983 to 1994, championed liberal values and solidified the Democratic party's progressive base. Throughout his tenure, Cuomo prioritized issues like income inequality, education reform, and social justice. He was a staunch advocate for civil rights, specifically for women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Step 2: Analyze Cuomo's decision not to run for the presidency Despite his popularity and significant support within the Democratic party, Mario Cuomo decided against running for president in 1992. In the end, Bill Clinton secured the Democratic nomination and went on to win the presidency. Cuomo's reluctance to run raised questions about the viability of strong liberal candidates in national elections, a debate that still echoes today. Step 3: Explore Andrew Cuomo's political career and aspirations Fast forward to the present day, and Mario Cuomo's son, Governor Andrew Cuomo, faces similar speculation about a possible presidential bid. As the 56th governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo has continued to advocate for progressive policies, such as gun control, LGBTQ+ rights, and climate change. If he were to run for office, whether in 2024 or later, he would face tough questions about his father's legacy and what it means for the modern Democratic party. Step 4: Examine the current state of U.S. politics and liberalism The current political climate in the United States is increasingly polarized, with many voters identifying as either staunchly conservative or heavily progressive. Moderate voices often struggle to gain traction in this environment. The resurgence of strong liberal ideas, such as healthcare reform, wealth redistribution, and social justice, is often met with resistance from conservative counterparts. Step 5: Evaluate the potential for liberalism to make a comeback Given the recent resurgence of progressive movements and policymaking, such as the Green New Deal, Marriage Equality Act, and Black Lives Matter, it appears that liberalism is making a slow but steady comeback. If Andrew Cuomo or other strong liberal candidates, potentially like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Elizabeth Warren, were to run for the presidency and secure popular support, it is possible that the return of liberal politics could become a reality. Conclusion: Mario Cuomo's death is a reminder of a time when a strong liberal voice could have made a substantial impact on the national stage. As his son, Governor Andrew Cuomo, potentially considers a presidential bid, the question arises of whether or not liberal ideas can regain prominence in U.S. politics. The answer, while not certain, will undoubtedly have a profound effect on the future of American political discourse and policymaking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: FILE - In this file photo dated Sunday Dec. 4, 2016, British actress Jodie Whittaker poses for photographers upon arrival at the The British Independent Film Awards in London. The BBC has announced Sunday... (Associated Press)      LONDON (AP) — British actress Jodie Whittaker was announced Sunday as the next star of the long-running science fiction series \\"Doctor Who\\" — the first woman to take a role that has been played by a dozen men over six decades.      Whittaker, best known for playing the mother of a murdered boy in detective drama \\"Broadchurch,\\" will replace Scottish actor Peter Capaldi at the end of the year, the BBC said.      Whittaker is the 13th official incarnation of the Doctor, a galaxy-hopping Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in the Tardis, a time machine shaped like an old-fashioned British police telephone booth.      In a testament to the place \\"Doctor Who\\" holds in Britain's cultural life, the revelation was made on live television after the Wimbledon men's tennis final. A film clip showed a mysterious hooded figure — revealed to be Whittaker — walking through the woods.      \\"Doctor Who\\" ran from 1963 to 1989, and was revived to acclaim in 2005. Its longevity is partly due to its flexible premise. The central character, known only as the Doctor, can travel across space and time and can regenerate into new bodies — allowing for endless recasting of the role.      Speculation had been mounting that a woman would get the role, generating excitement from some fans and opposition from others who feel that the character has been established as male.      Whittaker, 35, has worked extensively in British television and film. On the big screen, she played Anne Hathaway's best friend in romantic drama \\"One Day\\" and battled aliens in \\"Attack the Block.\\"      She said that becoming the first female Doctor \\"feels completely overwhelming, as a feminist, as a woman, as an actor, as a human.\\"      \\"I want to tell the fans not to be scared by my gender,\\" she said. \\"Because this is a really exciting time, and 'Doctor Who' represents everything that's exciting about change.\\" ||||| Jodie Whittaker has been announced as the Thirteenth Doctor.      The identity of the new Doctor was revealed exclusively on BBC One and on social media around the world after the Men’s Wimbledon Final on Sunday 16th July.      She will be the Thirteenth Time Lord and take over from Peter Capaldi who leaves the global hit show at Christmas.      New head writer and executive producer Chris Chibnall who takes over from Steven Moffat on the next series made the decision to cast the first ever woman in the iconic role.      Jodie Whittaker says: “I’m beyond excited to begin this epic journey - with Chris and with every Whovian on this planet. It’s more than an honour to play the Doctor. It means remembering everyone I used to be, while stepping forward to embrace everything the Doctor stands for: hope. I can’t wait.”      Chris Chibnall, New Head Writer and Executive Producer says :      “After months of lists, conversations, auditions, recalls, and a lot of secret-keeping, we’re excited to welcome Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor.      I always knew I wanted the Thirteenth Doctor to be a woman and we're thrilled to have secured our number one choice. Her audition for The Doctor simply blew us all away. Jodie is an in-demand, funny, inspiring, super-smart force of nature and will bring loads of wit, strength and warmth to the role. The Thirteenth Doctor is on her way.”      Peter Capaldi says : “Anyone who has seen Jodie Whittaker’s work will know that she is a wonderful actress of great individuality and charm. She has above all the huge heart to play this most special part. She’s going to be a fantastic Doctor.”      Charlotte Moore, Director of BBC Content says :      “Making history is what Doctor Who is all about and Chris Chibnall’s bold new take on the next Time Lord is exactly that. The nation is going to fall in love with Jodie Whittaker - and have lots of fun too!”      Piers Wenger, Controller BBC Drama says : \\"Jodie is not just a talented actor but she has a bold and brilliant vision for her Doctor. She aced it in her audition both technically and with the powerful female life force she brings to the role. She is destined to be an utterly iconic Doctor.\\"      Matt Strevens, Executive Producer says : \\"I'm so thrilled that Jodie Whittaker said yes to playing the Doctor. I've been a fan for years and always hoped to work with her. She is an actor of great emotional range and inhabits every role with complete passion and conviction. Just thinking about what she will bring to the Doctor makes me as excited as a kid at Christmas. It's going to be a lot of fun.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"In a significant announcement by BBC on July 16, 2017, British actress Jodie Whittaker was unveiled as the new star of the long-standing science fiction series, \\"Doctor Who\\".

Question: Given the background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  and the situation: Two meteorologists were good friends and discussed diverse issues weekly. This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages.  Answer the following question: Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background and situation, Norm, who read about mini-Ice ages, learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing compared to Tim, who read about the Greenhouse Effect.  The Greenhouse Effect primarily focuses on the role of greenhouse gases in increasing trapped terrestrial radiation. As stated in the background information, the presence of greenhouse gases leads to the absorption of longer infrared wavelengths, resulting in the retention of solar heat. This process directly contributes to the increase in the Earth's global temperature. Since Tim chose to read about the Greenhouse Effect, he gained a better understanding of how trapped terrestrial radiation increases due to the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and consequently impacts the Earth's temperature. On the other hand, Norm read about mini-Ice ages, which could provide insights into historical climate changes, temperature fluctuations, and the role of various factors that led to cold periods on Earth. While learning about mini-Ice ages might indirectly touch upon aspects of trapped terrestrial radiation, it would not provide the same level of focus on the increase in trapped terrestrial radiation as the Greenhouse Effect study would. Therefore, when comparing the topics of their individual readings, it is safe to conclude that Norm learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing compared to Tim."},{"instruction":"Q:I have a new situation: Rob is an amateur astronomer.

Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth.  But I can use this background: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? microscope Choices: [i] can diagnose disease caused by  carbon dioxide ; [ii] can diagnose disease caused by  virus ;","output":"In order to accomplish the goal of using a microscope to diagnose diseases caused by either carbon dioxide or viruses, one has to understand the basic principles of microscopy and be familiar with the specific techniques and procedures involved in diagnosing each type of disease. Microscopes are vital instruments utilized in various scientific and medical disciplines to visualize tiny objects, like cells and microorganisms, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Here are the detailed approaches for both options: Option i: Diagnose disease caused by carbon dioxide Diagnosing a disease caused by carbon dioxide exposure typically involves detection of the harmful effects of the gas on human health rather than observing the gas itself under the microscope. Carbon dioxide, as a gas, cannot be directly observed under a microscope. However, the detrimental effects of carbon dioxide on human tissues and cells can be viewed microscopically. 1. Identify the signs and symptoms: In order to diagnose carbon dioxide-related diseases, you should be aware of the potential symptoms associated with carbon dioxide exposure, such as respiratory distress, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, headaches, dizziness, and confusion. 2. Obtain samples: If carbon dioxide poisoning or exposure is suspected, samples should be collected from the patient, mostly blood samples or tissue biopsies, depending on the severity and type of exposure. 3. Prepare samples for microscopy: The collected samples must be processed and prepared for microscopic examination. Blood samples should be smeared on glass slides, while tissue samples should undergo fixation, embedding, and sectioning to produce thin slices for microscopic viewing. 4. Stain the samples: Appropriate staining techniques, such as using specific dyes or stains, must be employed to highlight any changes or damage caused by excessive carbon dioxide exposure on the examined cells or tissues. 5. Use appropriate microscope settings: Utilize a light or fluorescent microscope to view the stained samples. Adjust the magnification, light intensity, and focus to get the best possible view. 6. Analyze the microscopic findings: Identify and document any abnormalities observed in the samples. Look for indicators such as cellular alterations, inflammation, or tissue damage caused by excessive carbon dioxide exposure. 7. Collaborate with other diagnostic methods: Combine the findings from microscopy with other diagnostic tests like blood gas analysis and physical examination to confirm the diagnosis. Option ii: Diagnose disease caused by viruses In order to diagnose a viral infection, a microscope can be used to visualize the presence of viruses either directly or indirectly through detecting the specific effects they cause on the cells or tissues. 1. Collect samples: To diagnose a viral infection, samples like blood, saliva, urine, or tissue biopsies might be collected, depending on the type of virus and the infected organ or tissue. 2. Use viral isolation and culture: To study the virus, it can be isolated from the collected samples and cultured in appropriate cell lines or laboratory animals. This helps in obtaining a concentrated viral sample for further examination. 3. Apply appropriate staining techniques: Viral particles can be stained using specific dyes, fluorescent tags, or labeled antibodies targeting specific viral antigens. 4. Electron microscopy: Since viruses are extremely small, they cannot be observed under regular light microscopes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the most commonly used technique to visualize viruses directly, providing higher magnification and resolution. 5. Detect viral effects on cells and tissues: Alternatively, light or fluorescent microscopy can be used to observe the cytopathic effects produced by viruses on infected cells or tissues. For instance, the formation of syncytia or inclusion bodies can indicate viral infection. 6. Immunofluorescence and other indirect techniques: Indirect methods like immunofluorescence microscopy can be employed, where specific antibodies tagged with fluorescent dyes are utilized to detect the presence of viral antigens within the cells or tissues. 7. Interpret the findings and collaborate with other diagnostic methods: Analyze the gathered microscopic evidence to determine if the virus is present in the samples. Combine these findings with other diagnostic tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serological assays, and patient history, for a comprehensive diagnosis. In summary, depending on the goal, different microscopy techniques and approaches can be used to diagnose diseases caused either by carbon dioxide or viruses. A strong understanding of microscopy principles and available diagnostic methods is crucial for effectively accomplishing this goal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Definition: In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Input: The film begins in 2007 with Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) leaving his job as a successful editor in New York in order to spend more time with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and their two daughters, and to write his own book. At first, the family appears to be living the American dream in their new home, until they discover that its previous occupants, a mother and her two small daughters, were shot to death in the Atenton home. Public opinion has condemned the father of this family, Peter Ward, as the one responsible. However, there was not enough evidence to convict Peter in court, and he was also deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, and was recently released from police custody, and Will begins to feel he is seeing Peter watching the house.Will visits Greenhaven Psychiatric facility, where Peter was held for five years. Here he learns that on the night of the murders, Peter himself was shot in the head by his wife Elizabeth, who had somehow gotten hold of the murder weapon in the moments just before her death. In recovery, Peter couldnât believe heâd committed the murders, and so he no longer believed he was Peter Ward. He chewed his own name off all of his identification bracelets/cards/tags, leaving only his Greenhaven I.D. sequence: W1 - 1L 8 -10 -10: Will Atenton. Peter Ward and Will Atenton are the same person.Unable to believe this, Will rushes home and we see his home is really run down and condemned. Peter visits his neighbor, Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts). Ann had been a good friend to the Wards, and never believed Peter was the killer. Returning to the house, Peter remembers was on the phone with Libby when she stumbled on a burglar, who shot the little girls and wounded Libby. Peter attacked the gunman and Libby accidentally shot Peter.Ann's ex-husband Jack and the gunman burst into the now-decrepit Ward home. It is revealed that the hit-man had been hired to kill Ann, but broke into the wrong house and chose to kill the witnesses. Jack shoots the hit-man in the abdomen before staging the scene so it will appear that Peter has murdered again before burning the house down. Peter regains consciousness in time to fight off Jack and rescue Ann. As Peter and Ann make it out of the house, Jack starts up the cellar steps but is doused with kerosene by the dying hit-man, and Jack goes up in flames. The house burns to the ground.The film ends with a shot of Peter back in New York City. As he walks past a major booksellerâs window, we see that âDream Houseâ by Peter Ward has become a number one national bestseller., Question: Why was Peter Ward released from police custody ? Output:","output":"Peter Ward was released from police custody because there was not enough evidence to convict him in court, and he was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. – Seventeen years later, Faiz Siddiqui is still peeved about a poor grade he got in university—so peeved, in fact, that he's suing his former school for 1.3 million. At the High Court in London on Tuesday, a lawyer described how Siddiqui's dream of becoming an international commercial lawyer was crushed when a poor grade in the Indian special subject of his modern history course at Oxford University meant that he received a low upper second-class degree in June 2000, rather than a first-class or high upper second, report the BBC and Guardian. (In the UK, degrees are ranked based on a student's average mark.) Siddiqui, 39, who is unemployed, is seeking 1.3 million in lost wages while blaming \\"inadequate\\" teaching \\"in what was anticipated to be his favored special subject,\\" his lawyer says. Oxford acknowledges four of seven staff members who taught Asian history were on sabbatical during the 1999-2000 academic year. But a lawyer for the school—who describes Siddiqui's academic performance as \\"laced with inconsistency,\\" per the Telegraph—says Siddiqui received the same instruction as he would've in any other year. Siddiqui disagrees, claiming 13 of 15 students in the same situation as him received their \\"lowest or joint lowest mark\\" in the special subject. He adds his tutor failed to notify examiners of his health issues; Siddiqui says his clinical depression and insomnia only intensified following his \\"inexplicable failure.\\" A judge is expected to determine liability at the end of a seven-day hearing; the school lost its bid to have the case thrown out in December. A win for Siddiqui \\"could open the floodgates for similar claims,\\" per the Guardian. Expand this summary.","output":"So, let's imagine you're a kid who just didn't get the score you wanted on your school test. You feel you could have done better if your teacher had been more helpful or if they had known that you were feeling sick that day. Now, think about holding on to that feeling for 17 whole years - that's longer than you've been alive! This is how a man named Faiz Siddiqui feels about a grade he got back in university. Here's what happened:  Mr. Siddiqui studied at a very important school called Oxford University in a city named London. It's a big, busy place where lots of people want to learn. And Mr. Siddiqui’s dream was to become an international commercial lawyer. Think of this like being a superhero for businesses. But things did not go the way he wanted. In school, he took a class on modern Indian history which he really loved and thought he would do well in. But, instead of getting a grade called a \\"first-class\\" or a \\"high upper second-class,\\" which are sort of like getting a gold star, he was given a lower second-class degree in June 2000. This is like getting a bronze star, or even no star at all. He wasn't happy about that.  And because he was not happy, Mr. Siddiqui, who is now 39 years old and doesn’t have a job, decided to ask the school to give him 1.3 million. That's a big pile of money, like more candy than you could ever eat on Halloween. He believes that he could have earned that money if his grade had been better. He blamed the school’s “inadequate” teaching in the class that was his favourite. Now, let's look at Oxford University’s side. They said that in that school year, four out of seven teachers who taught Asian history were on a break, like your teacher might be during the summer. But, they also said that Mr. Siddiqui was taught in the same way as students in other years. They argued that his marks were not always good, hinting he was a student whose performance often changed.  Mr. Siddiqui disagreed. He argued that most students struggled the same way he did, showing that the problem was perhaps with the teaching and not the students. He also added that his sickness - he had trouble sleeping and was always sad - were not taken into account when they graded his paper. He said his health problems only got worse after his surprising result.  All these arguments are going to be discussed in a big, important meeting that will last 7 days, where a person called a judge will decide who is correct. This is like when you and a friend argue and your teacher decides who is right. The school tried to stop this meeting from happening last year in December but couldn’t.  If Mr. Siddiqui wins, then other students who feel they were treated unfairly may also want to sue their schools. This means that this case could lead to a lot more people asking their schools for piles of candy. So, this is pretty important and lots of people are watching to see what will happen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Title: After the Sunset Movie plot: Master thief Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and his beautiful accomplice, Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek), steal the second of three famous diamonds, known as the Napoleon diamonds, from FBI Agent Stanley P. Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). But Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond. She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas. Agent Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle and partners up with Sophia, a local constable, to try and capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri MoorÃ©, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett's impressive history as a thief and offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond. Burdett, still wanting the diamond for himself, pretends to work with MoorÃ©, and gives him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he had earlier related to Stan), having no trouble keeping ahead of his nemesis in the meantime. Lola kicks Max out after he breaks his promise to spend their first sunset on her new deck she had been working on and after she finds out he lied about writing his vows to her. Max is forced to bunk with Stan, and they share their thoughts about each other's lives. The next morning, the authorities and Sophie discover them, revealing that Stan's FBI...

CBC.ca - Arts - Film - M for Muddled I'm not as happy as I look: Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta. Courtesy Warner Brothers Pictures. V for Vendetta runs for just over two hours, but it feels like 10. Fans of Alan Mooreâs original graphic novel will likely construe this as a good thing. General audiencesâ¦ not so much. The illusory duration of this dystopian saga owes not to the plot, but to the byzantine back story, which is meted out with laborious effort. The place is London, the time a few decades in the future. Britons are under the heel of a totalitarian state. The streets are an Orwellian tableau of loudspeakers, video screens and roaming surveillance trucks. The airwaves are occupied by xenophobic blowhards. A young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) ventures out one night and is cornered by three âFingermen.â Although officially tasked to enforce the cityâs strict curfew, these gents have something nastier in mind for Evey. Before they can begin their dirty business, Eveyâs would-be assailants are waylaid, Batman-fashion, by a lanky stranger in a creepy white mask. First, he slays them with his alliterative wit (the scene is brought to you by the letter V); then, he just slays them. The sequence is both exhilarating and refreshingly stagy for an action flick. The man introduces himself as V and invites Evey to a rooftop âconcert.â Though puzzled, she accepts â and ends up witnessing the cleverly orchestrated detonation of Londonâs Old Bailey building. Evey is soon forced to take refuge with V when the state police suspect her of being his co-conspirator. Who is this guy? And whatâs with his appetite for destruction? Itâs complicated. (Have you got two hours?) The mask is an ode to proto-terrorist Guy Fawkes. On November 5, 1605, Fawkes, an Englishman infuriated by the Protestant monarchyâs brutal treatment of Catholics, tried to blow up the British Houses of Parliament. He was caught and hanged for his treachery. Vâs beef is more elusive. Whatâs immediately clear, however, is that he harbours a world of resentment and is fomenting a big olâ revolution. In a cunning bait-and-switch manoeuvre, V later commandeers the airwaves of Londonâs biggest news station to outline his plan: in exactly one year, he and an army of like-minded citizens will gather outside Parliament to watch it blow sky-high, thus carrying out Fawkesâ original threat. The plot is set. Now you just have to sit through an hour and a half of narrative backfill. Can't you put on your frowning mask?: Weaving and Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta. Courtesy Warner Brothers Pictures. Alan Mooreâs original comic was a broadside against the Tory government of Margaret Thatcher, which Moore saw as an oppressively dark chapter in English history. Scripted by the Wachowskis (The Matrix) and directed by their protÃ©gÃ©, John McTeigue, the film version is equally polemical. The government is run by a bilious autocrat named Sutler (a splenetic John Hurt); after a U.S.-initiated nuclear holocaust ravaged much of Europe, Sutler staged a fascist coup, quickly establishing a police state that incarcerates minorities and brooks no opposition. That Moore has publicly denounced this adaptation (refusing even to see it) obscures the fact that the film is actually quite faithful to the book. Therein lies the problem. In the movie, as in the comic, the state is responsible for a laundry list of evil deeds: religious intolerance, homophobia, suspension of civil liberties, police brutality, concentration camps, eugenic experimentation, shouting. The Wachowskis seize the opportunity to add some topical updates, railing against right-wing pundits and Big Pharma and visually evoking Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. Alas, the film doesnât conjure evil incarnate; it presents a parody of it. V for Vendetta soon reaches such a hysterical pitch, itâs hard to take it seriously. The film is rescued from its one-dimensionality by the two main characters. V is played by Hugo Weaving (the terse Agent Smith in The Matrix trilogy), who gives us one of cinemaâs most unlikely vigilantes. Weavingâs performance is at once menacing and mincing; his theatricality isnât surprising, one supposes, given that heâs acting through a mask. V spends much of the film murdering a string of government operatives who played some role in his hazy, horrific past â which seems to involve unlawful captivity, torture, first-degree burns and who-knows-what-else. Evey, meanwhile, carries her own baggage: her parents were dissidents murdered in the early days of Sutlerâs reign. While a lesser actress might have remained an uncomprehending bystander, Portman gives it her all, exploring Eveyâs vulnerability, but also her growing discomfort with Vâs reactionary violence. If V for Vendettaâs censure of draconian governments feels somewhat rote, the filmâs exploration of the freedom fighter mindset is a propos and appropriately complex. One of the storyâs key allusions is to that archetypal revenge tale, The Count of Monte Cristo. (Itâs Vâs favourite film.) In it, the protagonist becomes so preoccupied with avenging his betrayal that he ceases to exist as anything more than an agent of ruin. Behind Vâs perpetually smirking mask is a man consumed by rage. Heâs less a man than an ideology â an ideology whose tactics, as Evey quite rightly points out, become increasingly âmonstrous.â As the film lurches to its climax, it becomes clear that, regardless of the outcome, British society will not see closure. There are years of struggle ahead. V for Vendetta seems to suggest that weâre too far along our misguided course for pat solutions. Itâs a powerful notion. Too bad we have to wade through all that dense exposition to get to it. V for Vendetta opens Mar. 17 across Canada. Andre Mayer writes about the arts for CBC.ca.

Sentence from a movie review: so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the given sentence from a movie review, it is evident that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The expressions \\"insanely stupid\\" and \\"awful in so many ways\\" clearly demonstrate that the reviewer had an unfavorable opinion of the film. These phrases suggest that the reviewer felt the movie had numerous shortcomings and failed to achieve a level of quality they deemed acceptable. \\"Insanely stupid\\" implies that the film's plot, characters, or general execution was irrational or nonsensical beyond tolerability. This could relate to a myriad of factors such as incoherent or implausible storylines, poorly developed characters, clichéd or hackneyed themes, or even subpar production values. Overall, this phrase reveals that the reviewer found the movie lacking in one or more vital aspects that constitute a good film. The additional statement \\"awful in so many ways\\" serves to emphasize just how negative the reviewer's experience of watching the movie was. This remark suggests that there were multiple aspects of the film that the reviewer considered terrible. It is possible that they found the movie to be appalling on various levels, such as the script, acting, direction, cinematography, or music. This further strengthens the case for a decidedly negative stance on the movie. In summary, the sentence from the movie review paints a decidedly negative picture of the film. The reviewer's choice of words like \\"insanely stupid\\" and \\"awful in so many ways\\" reflects their dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the movie.

Answer:","output":"To win the Stanley Cup, a team must triumph in the best-of-seven playoff series that takes place at the end of the NHL (National Hockey League) season, in the Stanley Cup Finals. This means that a team must secure at least four victories out of a maximum of seven possible games to be crowned the champions and etch their names on the prestigious trophy. The NHL playoff structure consists of four rounds, each featuring a best-of-seven series. The first three rounds determine the Conference champions from the Eastern and Western Conferences, while the final round, known as the Stanley Cup Finals, pits the two Conference champions against each other for the ultimate prize. Here's a breakdown of the path to the Stanley Cup: 1. Round One: Known as the \\"Division Semifinals,\\" eight teams in both the Eastern and Western Conferences compete, with the top team in each division facing the fourth-seeded team, and the second-seeded team taking on the third-seeded team. The winners of these series move on to the next round. 2. Round Two: Called the \\"Division Finals,\\" the advancing teams within each division face off in another best-of-seven series. The winners of this round become the Division champions and advance to the Conference Finals. 3. Round Three: Also known as the \\"Conference Finals,\\" the victorious Division champions in each Conference compete in a best-of-seven series to secure the Conference titles — the Prince of Wales Trophy for the Eastern Conference, and the Clarence S.

Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has confounded expectations by delivering a cool, considered denial of charges leveled against him during a keenly-anticipated corruption trial that has captivated China. So far, the public has heard more details of the case than many anticipated. Live tweets from the court house in Jinan, Shandong, are now being followed by more than 460,000 people and this number is expected to rise. After the first full day of testimony, CNN asked prominent China analyst Cheng Li, from the Brookings Institution in Washington, for his thoughts on how and why the trial has veered so dramatically off-script. CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case. What has been the most surprising twist? Cheng Li: There were two surprises. One is that Bo has rejected all allegations so far, and said he \\"unwillingly\\" accepted the charge when he was being questioned by the central disciplinary commission investigation team. The second surprise is that the prosecution has performed very poorly in trying to make a strong case against him; it seems to be falling apart. All of a sudden, in my view, Bo has decided not to cooperate, but not completely. Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most. CNN: Did Bo and his legal team wrong-foot the leadership? Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable. If you reviewed his career he always surprised people. He has always played the wildcard. It will be the authorities' problem if they didn't prepare for that. When you have a semi-open trial you need to prepare. There's a lot of praise in Chinese social media for the judge for his professional manner, but the prosecutors are terrible. Bo has rejected virtually everything in a very effective way. But that means even the leadership can't rely too much on the promises or deals made by Bo. CNN: Do you think a deal was done before the trial and does that appear to be unraveling? Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges. The deal is they dropped some of the most severe charges against him. If you look at September 28 when they arrested him and expelled him from the Communist Party -- there were about six or seven charges, including obstruction of justice and womanizing and, probably most importantly, during the investigation of the murder of Neil Heywood they allegedly found some other criminal activities. In July, they put forward only three charges: Bribery, corruption and abuse of power. CNN: What's the problem for the leadership strategy to focus on corruption? Bo was the wrong person to focus on corruption because he was famous for being anti-corruption during his tenure in Chongqing. And relatively speaking, at least in people's perception, he's not that corrupted. He made a lot of people nervous about his self-promotion campaign -- that's the real reason, not about corruption. Bo Xilai's real ambition is not about the money. He wants to be a top leader, or the top leader. By that time the whole country would be his. That's the fundamental dilemma for the leadership. Now the leadership is in an awkward position -- the charges of corruption will not resonate too well and they can't go back to the other charges. So what kind of verdict will they give him? Certainly it will not be too severe. If it's too lenient they'll receive other serious criticism so it's really a no-win situation for the leadership. CNN: What do you think the reaction will be in the leadership after this \\"change of script\\"? Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him. In my view he was clear, focused, articulate and eloquent. Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did. I think the authorities' case is not in good shape on day one. CNN: Has the leadership's tactic backfired? Could Bo have gained more support than he's lost in the past 24 hours? Li: Absolutely. There are a lot of rumors that he was very emotional and out of control in jail. But he presented himself very well. He was very respectful, reasonable, had a human touch, he cared about Dalian, he cared about its people. He claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys. He made a clear cut with his wife; blamed many things on his wife, especially the things that he claimed he did not know. Also, his defense lawyer did an excellent job to use very clear language to undermine a lot of the accusations. Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise, in many ways. CNN: Did you find it surprising that he seemed to turn on his wife, Gu Kailai? Li: A line has been drawn. His defense lawyer kept emphasizing her unstable mental status and most of the people in China believe that. If you look at the pictures before her arrest and in the court, it looks like there's a problem. Of course the prosecution didn't buy that, but when people judge, at least the civilian people, they buy that argument. So Bo has successfully drawn a line between him and his wife and used it to undermine her testimony. CNN: There was a lot of talk when the scandal emerged -- and in subsequent months -- that the case would shake-up Chinese politics. Is it that the case, or will it be business as usual after the verdict? Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse. So this case already has a strong impact. In 18 months a lot has changed; there's been a leadership succession, Wen Jiabao's retirement, and the princelings have consolidated their power. The leadership wants to move forward. They want to put it behind them and move onto other issues. That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system. CNN: Given the apparent troubled nature of the prosecution's case, is there any chance Bo could be in the 0.1% of Chinese suspects not convicted at trial? Li: Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous. But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they've conducted this trial. So there are difficulties for the prosecution unless there are dramatic twists and turns in the following days. I think certainly the sentencing won't be the death penalty, probably not even the death penalty commuted to life. The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The corruption trial of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai in 2013 saw him vehemently deny all allegations against him. Instead of following a tight script as many had expected, the trial went off-script with Bo surprisingly rejecting all charges brought against him, something that prominent China analyst Cheng Li believes hurt the prosecution's case. There were also poor performances by the prosecution team, but for some real surprises, Bo blasted all allegations effectively. Although a conviction was certain due to Chinese legal system convention, the trial revealed serious flaws in the system and negative aspects of Chinese politics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which event most likely caused the unusual climate in Europe that year?. Answer:","output":"The unusual climate in Europe in 1783, characterized by an extended cold period, foggy conditions, and acidic rain, was most likely caused by the eruption of the Laki volcano in Iceland. This eruption, which started on June 8, 1783, and lasted until February 1784, was one of the most devastating in recorded history. Volcanic eruptions can have substantial impacts on the climate due to the enormous amount of gas and volcanic ash they release into the atmosphere. When a volcano erupts, it spews millions of tons of sulfur dioxide and other aerosols into the Earth's stratosphere. These particles can form an atmospheric shield, reflecting some of the Sun's radiation back into space, thus leading to a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. This phenomenon can last for months, even years, following an eruption, depending on its magnitude. In the case of the Laki eruption, it expelled an estimated 14 cubic kilometers of basalt lava and clouds of poisonous hydrofluoric acid and sulfur dioxide compounds that killed over 50% of Iceland's livestock population, leading to a famine that killed approximately 25% of the island's human population. The gas and the ash released had significant effects on the climate not just in Iceland but across the Northern Hemisphere. The poisonous cloud drifted to Europe, causing damage to vegetation and reportedly causing illnesses. The hydrofluoric acid that fell with the rain caused acid damage to trees and plants. It is believed to have been the cause of unusually high mortality in England. The released sulfur aerosols caused a cooling effect, leading to the unusual cold experienced in Europe in 1783. Besides the cold, the aerosols also resulted in light scattering, which could have contributed to the foggy conditions. The phenomena also disrupted weather patterns, resulting in unusual hot summer weather giving way to an extremely harsh winter, which Europe, particularly the UK, found difficult to cope with. Crop productivity plummeted, leads to food shortages, widespread malnutrition and increased death rates. Therefore, the Laki eruption in 1783 is the most probable cause for the unusually cold and foggy conditions in Europe, along with the occurrence of acidic rain that year. This incident offers a clear example of the large-scale climatic impact a significant volcanic eruption can have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Pyöräily kesäolympialaisissa 1900 Translate this to English?","output":"Cycling in the Summer Olympics 1900 The text \\"Pyöräily kesäolympialaisissa 1900\\" translates to \\"Cycling in the Summer Olympics 1900\\" in English.  The 1900 Summer Olympics, also referred to as the Games of the II Olympiad, were held in Paris, France, from May 14 to October 28, 1900. This marked the first time that competitive cycling was included in the Olympic program. The cycling events consisted of two track races and three road races, attracting competitors from various countries. The five cycling events during the 1900 Summer Olympics were divided into two categories: track cycling and road cycling. Track cycling events were held at the Vélodrome de Vincennes, a venue specifically built for bicycle racing in Paris. The two events were the men's sprint, also known as the 2000-meter sprint, and the men's 25-kilometer race. The road cycling category included three distinct races: men's 50 kilometers, men's 100 kilometers, and the men's points race, which was an individual time trial event held over the course of two rounds. The 1900 Summer Olympics marked the beginning of competitive Olympic cycling, and it featured many notable cyclists of the time. The men's sprint was won by French cyclist Georges Taillandier, while the men's 25-kilometer race was won by another Frenchman, Émile Torchebœuf. The men's 50-kilometer road race was won by French cyclist Louis Bastien, and the men's 100-kilometer race was won by French cyclist Charles Baudry. Finally, the men's points race was also won by a French cyclist, Louis Hildebrand. The 1900 Summer Olympics showcased the burgeoning popularity of cycling both as a mode of transportation and a competitive sport. Cycling had grown rapidly during the 1890s, with the invention of the pneumatic tire and improved bicycle designs. The inclusion of cycling in the Olympic program helped cement its position as a popular sport across the world. The success of French cyclists at the 1900 Summer Olympics boosted the popularity of the sport in France and ushered the country into a golden age of cycling, particularly in the form of the renowned Tour de France, which commenced in 1903. In summary, the 1900 Summer Olympics played a significant role in the history of competitive cycling, as it marked the first time the sport was included in the Olympic Games. Five events were held in total, with the French cyclists dominating the field, and this crucial moment cemented cycling’s international appeal and laid the groundwork for future Olympic competitions and professional cycling events, such as the Tour de France."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? who set the fires in little fires everywhere?","output":"\\"Little Fires Everywhere\\" is a novel by Celeste Ng, published in 2017, which was later adapted into a television series for Hulu in 2020. The story is set in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and revolves around the lives of two families: the wealthy and seemingly perfect Richardson family, and the nomadic Warren family, led by the enigmatic artist Mia Warren and her teenage daughter, Pearl. The overarching mystery in the story involves a series of small fires that were set in the Richardson family's home, and who was responsible for them. In both the novel and the television adaptation, the culprit behind the fires is eventually revealed, but the identity of the arsonist is different in each version. In the novel: It is discovered that the fires in the Richardson's house were set by Izzy, the youngest daughter of the Richardson family. Izzy is a complex character who struggles to fit in with her family's expectations and forms a close bond with Mia Warren and her artistic, nonconformist perspective on life. This relationship fuels Izzy's growing resentment of her family's obsession with appearances and social status. Izzy's motivations for setting the fires are rooted in her frustration with her family's hypocrisies, their unwillingness to accept her true self, and their judgmental treatment of Mia Warren. Devastated by what she perceives as her mother's betrayal and disapproval, Izzy starts small fires in each of her family members' rooms as a final act of rebellion against the life they've tried to force upon her. It is implied at the end of the novel that Izzy leaves Shaker Heights after the fire, searching for a new, authentic life that mirrors Mia's journey. In the television adaptation: The identity of the arsonist is changed to encompass the collective actions of all four Richardson children: Lexie, Trip, Moody, and Izzy. While Izzy remains the primary instigator and the one who comes up with the idea, her siblings find themselves caught up in the intensity of the situation and the shared desire to break free from the stifling environment of their household. Each sibling has their own reasons and personal experiences that lead to their participation in the arson. In this adaptation, Izzy's motivation remains largely the same as in the novel, while her siblings express different forms of dissatisfaction with their lives and the pressures they face. The collective act of setting the fires symbolizes their shared desire for change, autonomy, and an escape from the societal forces that have shaped their identities. In conclusion, the answer to the question of who set the fires in \\"Little Fires Everywhere\\" differs according to the version you are referring to. In the novel, it was Izzy Richardson, while in the television adaptation, all four Richardson siblings were responsible for the act."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: From what movie was the song that the band who played Townsend's solo material live used as an intro at concerts in 2003 and 2004? from the following article ?  Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band. The answer is:","output":"\\"Blame Canada\\" from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.  Step 1: Understand the question and identify the relevant information needed to answer it.

It appears that there has been some kind of accident or mishap, which has led to property damage. This damage may involve a rented or borrowed item, like a car, equipment, or even a venue. Grace asks Phil whether he had obtained a damage waiver, which is an agreement that waives or reduces the person's responsibility to pay for damages in the case of an accident or mishap. Damage waivers are often offered by rental companies to protect customers from unexpected financial burdens resulting from damages incurred during the rental period. It's important to note that a damage waiver is not the same as insurance, but it usually serves as an additional layer of protection for the renter. Phil replies in disappointment, indicating that he did not get a damage waiver. As a result, he is now responsible for the full cost of repairs or replacements needed to fix the damage that has occurred. Grace points this out, so it seems that the situation they are in has financial implications for Phil, and he is unhappy about this outcome. In summary, the conversation revolves around a scenario where Phil has not obtained a damage waiver for a rented or borrowed item, and as a consequence, he has to bear the financial burden of the damages incurred.

News article: Once Subversive, Frieze Opens in a Changing London LONDON — Over the past 13 years Frieze has grown into one of the biggest weeks in the art market calendar. The sprawling scale of the event, centered on a fair in a tent in Regent’s Park, reflects how dramatically London, and its commercial relationship with art, has changed. The etymology dates back to 1988, when a Goldsmiths College student named Damien Hirst organized an exhibition called “Freeze” in the disused offices of the London Port Authority in SE16, a run-down area close to the river Thames. The pop-up show of works by 16 young artists that included Mr. Hirst, Sarah Lucas and Gary Hume was visited by influential curators and collectors like Charles Saatchi, Nicholas Serota and Norman Rosenthal. The rest, as we know, is art history. Today Frieze, which opens to the public Wednesday, is a must-attend fixture for many. The fair, which was officially begun by the Frieze magazine publishers Amanda Sharp and Matthew Slotover in 2003, has become a unique combination of a destination fair (or two, now that the more historical Frieze Masters has joined the mix since 2012). It combines high-end auctions (nine this week at Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips, estimated to raise at least 180 million pounds, or about 276 million), museum exhibitions and gallery shows. While Frieze has thrived, SE16, like so many areas of London, has been transformed by luxury redevelopment. The real estate agent Foxtons is currently offering a new two-bedroom apartment in the original ‘‘Freeze’’ district for £975,000. With its prefabricated venue and quirky projects, the Frieze Art Fair still retains a faint residual flavor of the grungier London that produced the Young British Artists. But nowadays the six-day fair, which this year features 164 galleries from 27 countries, caters to pretty much the same international crowd that attends the previews of Art Basel and the Venice Biennale. Prices for artworks typically range from about 10,000 to 1 million. “Frieze is no longer a fair where the feeling is young and cutting-edge,” said Abigail Asher, partner in the New York art advisory firm Guggenheim, Asher, Associates Inc., in a telephone interview. “The people who descend on London for Frieze Week are looking for more established artists.” In 1997, “Freeze” exhibitors formed the core of the provocative “Sensation” exhibition of works by Young British Artists at the Royal Academy of Arts. Mr. Hirst’s meteoric rise culminated in September 2008 with the two-day auction of his artworks at Sotheby’s that earned £111.5 million. Mr. Hirst is no longer the force he was in the market. Instead, he has reverted back to his role as curator by opening his own private museum in Lambeth, south London. But memories of the glory days of his “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever” auction will be sparked this week by the presence of his 2008-9 shark-in-formaldehyde piece, “Heaven,” in an exhibition on the theme of the sea at the Mayfair dealer Ordovas. One of 11 made, and the only left in private hands — which happen to be Mr. Hirst’s — it carries a price-tag that will only be disclosed to wealthy collectors. London provides any number of opportunities to buy respected names. First, there are the fairs. Hauser & Wirth, for example, is devoting its entire booth at Frieze to a range of sculptures by artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Subodh Gupta, Phyllida Barlow and Paul McCarthy. The latter’s 1992 sculpture “Pecker Leg” is priced at 375,000. Tellingly, unlike the week of Art Basel in Switzerland or Miami Beach, London’s Frieze Week lacks a supporting network of well-regarded satellite fairs that showcase emerging galleries and artists (though the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair at Somerset House does give some regional perspective). Frieze’s most successful sidekick is in fact PAD London, a boutique fair in Berkeley Square primarily devoted to upscale 20th-century art and design that benefits from its proximity to luxury hotels such as the Connaught and Claridge’s. The ninth edition, featuring 62 galleries, runs from Wednesday through Sunday. Sharing the same dates, the SUNDAY fair, near Regent’s Park, is the week’s one non-Frieze-branded event that attracts serious collectors in search of undiscovered talent. The London gallery Seventeen is one of 25 galleries from 11 countries exhibiting in its sixth edition. An east London gallery specializing in video art, Seventeen will be showing the 2015 video, “Untitled (Pressing On),” by the British artist Jimmy Merris, born in 1983, priced about £2,000 to £3,000. “It’s more experimental. I can take risks,” said David Hoyland, director of Seventeen, in a telephone interview. “I can set the tone for a solo show, and it doesn’t matter if I don’t sell anything.” Mr. Hoyland, along with many other gallerists, is concerned about the effect London’s spiraling property prices is having on the artistic life of the city. “Rents have tripled in east London. You just can’t find cheap spaces any more. The bottom of the art world pyramid is being eroded.” Mr. Hoyland said that Mr. Merris can no longer afford to live in London and has moved to Wales. Similar sentiments were expressed by Michael Elmgreen, the London-based half of the artist duo Elmgreen & Dragset, who are exhibiting new works at Victoria Miro Mayfair. “It’s a fantastic place to show, not a fantastic place to live,” said Mr. Elmgreen, who has made London his home for the last seven years, in an interview. “I don’t think there’s such a strong art scene in London anymore. It’s a theater without actors. The artists aren’t there, but the institutions give amazing shows for the tourists.” Mr. Elmgreen said he has is moving back to Berlin, where Ingar Dragset lives. The duo’s “Self-Portraits” at Victoria Miro expand the museum wall-labels of works by artists such as David Hockney and Martin Kippenberger into independent works of art, priced at as much as £40,000. While the Royal Academy of Arts is presenting works by Ai Weiwei and the new Hyundai Commission for the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall by the Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas will be opening during Frieze, London’s commercial galleries are also putting on some pretty amazing shows. In Albemarle Street, the Turin dealership Mazzoleni is holding a retrospective of 23 works by the Arte Povera artist Alberto Burri. These include a trademark 1968 “Rosso Plastica” composition, priced at more than €4 million. Down the street, the fellow Italian dealer Tornabuoni is inaugurating its London gallery with a show of more than 50 works by another Arte Povera star: Lucio Fontana. These include a white 1963 version of the artist’s revered egg-shaped “La Fine di Dio” canvases from a private collection. Another version, in black, has been guaranteed to sell for at least £15 million, or about 23 million, at Sotheby’s on Thursday. “Our collector will decide if he wants to sell over the next few days,” said the gallery’s director, Ursula Casamonti, in an interview. “If he does, the price will be higher than at Sotheby’s.” Nearby, the Mayfair branch of the New York dealership David Zwirner is holding its first London show of new works by the Colombian artist Oscar Murillo, born in 1986 and based in London. Mr. Murillo was one of several emerging artists targeted by speculators in 2014. Zwirner’s “binary function” show, with prices as high as 280,000 for new paintings, will confirm that he is now an “established” artist. And then there is the loan show of Cy Twombly works from the CY Twombly Foundation that inaugurates Gagosian’s new state-of-the-art 18,000-square-foot gallery at Grosvenor Hill in Mayfair, and the first London show of paintings by the Los Angeles artist Jonas Wood, born in 1977, held in Gagosian’s equally imposing space at Britannia Street, near King’s Cross. With the auction prices of many once-fashionable young abstract painters now in decline, Mr. Wood has become the figurative painter of the moment. A monumental and typically accessible 2008 painting, “Untitled (M.V. Landscape),” depicting houses at Martha’s Vineyard, is estimated to sell for £250,000 to £350,000 at Christie’s next Friday. Can the market absorb so much material? Last year, 1,638 properties priced at more than 5 million were sold in London, more than any other city in the world, according to a report published this month by the realtors Knight Frank.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland? The answer is:","output":"The forest in Ireland would generally receive less rainfall compared to the forests in Laos.  Tropical forests, like those in Laos, are characterized by high rainfall, with annual precipitation typically ranging from 2000 to 4500 millimeters (79 to 177 inches). This abundant rainfall contributes to the moist, dense environment commonly associated with tropical forests. Laos, being a part of Southeast Asia, experiences a tropical monsoon climate, resulting in heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (around May to October). On the other hand, temperate forests, such as those found in Ireland, experience lower rainfall levels. Ireland's forests, located in a temperate oceanic climate zone, receive an average annual precipitation of around 1000 to 2500 millimeters (39 to 98 inches) depending on the location in the country, with the western parts receiving higher rainfall than the eastern parts. Although Ireland is known for its frequent rain and cloudy weather, the overall volume of rainfall is less compared to tropical regions like Laos.

Question: During what years was the Portugal region incorporated in the Roman Republic? Is \\"The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula located in South Western Europe.\\" the correct answer?","output":"While the statement \\"The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula located in South Western Europe\\" is accurate, it does not provide a specific answer to the question concerning the years when the Portugal region was incorporated into the Roman Republic. To answer the question, we need to delve deeper into the region's historical timeline. The conquest and incorporation of Portugal (which was commonly referred to as Lusitania at the time) into the Roman Republic began in the 2nd century BCE and was completed by the early 1st century BCE. The initial phase of Roman interest in the Iberian Peninsula, including the region that is now Portugal, took place during the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage (264-146 BCE). As a result of the Second Punic War (218-201 BCE), Rome gained control of the eastern half of the Iberian Peninsula, while the western region remained under the influence of local tribes. Over the next century, Rome gradually extended its control over more of the Iberian Peninsula, driven by a combination of economic interests and strategic concerns. The region that now constitutes Portugal was first invaded during the Lusitanian Wars in 155 BCE. However, it took Rome several decades to achieve a lasting subjugation of the Lusitani and other tribes that inhabited the area. The final pacification of Lusitania occurred during the reign of Caesar Augustus (27 BCE - 14 CE) in the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire period. Although the exact timeline is debated by historians, it is generally considered that the incorporation of Lusitania into the Roman Republic was completed around 27 BCE, when the region became officially established as a Roman province. So, the process of incorporation took place mainly between the 2nd century BCE and the early 1st century BCE, with the exact year of completion around 27 BCE. In this period, Portugal, or Lusitania, became a significant part of the Roman Republic and, later, the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"Q: The energy in sunlight is also known as what kind of energy?

Article: People often talk as if shyness is a disease or mental condition that can be cured. I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul. Question: The author thinks that our shyness is there because  _  .

I like to tell stories about people who work together. What is even better is when countries help each other and build a good friendship. An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties  did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province. At the moment the Milu deer live in centres where they are being well protected and cared for. It is hoped that one day there will be enough animals to let them live in the wild again. 294words A:","output":"A: In the article about the Milu deer, which countries worked together to bring them back to China? 1.

Question: What kind of town is Ambrose? Movie title: House of Wax Movie plot: The movie opens with title and credits over the streets of turn of the century New York City at night in the pouring rain. A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books. They have a philosophical difference between their approaches to business. Jarrod proposes a buyout arrangement, and Burke either eager or desperate for the money agrees in principle. A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum. Wallace is impressed, but Jarrod explains that he's never satisfied with certain aspects of the finished products. Wallace explains he's going to Egypt for three months, so no decision on investment can take place prior to his return. Allison and Wallace depart. Burke was eavesdropping from the upstairs room and heard everything. He is impatient for a financial settlement and proposes an insurance fire. The place is insured for 25,000--12,500 each. Jarrod is horrified by the proposal, and opposes it categorically. Burke lights the Marie Antoinette wax figure's dress with a match. It starts a fire that Jarrod quickly extinguishes. Burke starts a few more fires, with Jarrod quickly working to save his wax figures. Burke and Jarrod fight, and at one point Jarrod is knocked out. Burke douses the workroom and display area with a flammable liquid and turns on the gas light spigots. He goes upstairs as the place begins to catch fire. He returns to the workroom and continues his fight with the now revived Jarrod. Jarrod works desperately with buckets of water to douse the fire, but it is a losing battle. He is knocked out again by Burke and left...

What is best foreign language to learn?","output":"While these two questions both ask for identifying the best foreign language to learn, they differ in a crucial aspect. The first question asks for both the \\"best foreign language\\" and an explanation as to why it is considered the best, whereas the second question purely asks for the \\"best foreign language\\" without seeking an accompanying rationale.  To thoroughly answer the first question, one needs to consider several factors such as personal interests, geographic location, career goals, and linguistic diversity.  1. Personal Interest: If someone is passionate about a particular culture, region, or literature, they're more likely to stay motivated while learning the respective language. For example, a person interested in classical literature may choose to learn Latin or Ancient Greek, while one interested in Japanese culture may choose to learn Japanese. 2. Geographic Location: Where an individual resides or plans to live can play a significant role in determining the most useful foreign language to learn. For instance, if a person lives in the United States, learning Spanish would be highly beneficial, as it is the second most spoken language in the country. Similarly, someone residing in Europe may find learning German or French will provide more opportunities for communication and cultural exchange. 3. Career Goals: Language proficiency can be a great asset in various professional fields, such as international business, diplomacy, tourism, and academia. For example, if a person aspires to work in global trade, learning languages like Mandarin (due to China's economic prominence), Spanish (widely spoken in Central and South America), or Arabic (spoken in the fast-growing economies of the Middle East) could offer a competitive edge. 4. Linguistic Diversity: Learning a language from a different language family can be enriching and cognitively stimulating. For example, an English speaker might find learning languages like Chinese, Japanese, or Arabic challenging and rewarding due to the difference in grammar, alphabet, and script. In contrast, the second question focuses merely on identifying the \\"best foreign language\\" to learn. This question requires a simple answer, although it may still be subject to the above-discussed factors. However, it does not explicitly ask for reasons behind the choice. Thus, a straightforward reply may be given, such as \\"The best foreign language to learn is Mandarin Chinese due to its linguistic diversity and vast number of native speakers.\\" In conclusion, although both questions revolve around identifying the best foreign language to learn, they differ in their demand for a detailed explanation. The first question specifically calls for a comprehensive discussion covering the rationale behind the choice, whereas the second question is satisfied with a simpler, definitive response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the only way to advance in his profession.  What was his profession?  Choices:  - workplace - science - algebra - province - construction business  The rationale to choose \\"construction business\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The correct choice for Sammy's profession in this scenario is the \\"construction business.\\" Numerous reasons support this conclusion, which are outlined below: 1. Union memberships are common in the construction industry: Union memberships are well-established and widespread in the construction business. This industry often involves job sites with numerous workers from different trades, and labor unions serve as a vital element in protecting their rights, ensuring proper wages, and advocating for better working conditions. 2. Job advancement through unions: In the construction business, union members usually have access to better job opportunities, higher wages, and various benefits. As mentioned in the question, Sammy had to be a union member to advance in his profession. This suggests that he works in a field where union membership is closely related to career progress, which is a reality in the construction sector. 3. Collective bargaining: Unions in the construction industry negotiate wages, benefits, and working conditions on behalf of their members through collective bargaining. This allows workers to have a stronger voice in negotiating employment conditions. The statement that Sammy had to be a union member implies that his profession would be one where collective bargaining is active and necessary for professional progress, which is true for the construction business. 4. Union-provided training: In the construction industry, unions often offer training and apprenticeship programs to their members. By joining a union, workers can learn new skills and improve their marketability, making it more likely that they advance in their profession. Since the question emphasizes Sammy's need for union membership for career growth, it can be concluded that he works in an industry like construction, where unions actively provide opportunities for professional development. 5. Worker safety and protection: Construction work can be hazardous, often involving heavy machinery, dangerous equipment, and exposure to harsh conditions. Labor unions play a crucial role in ensuring worker safety and protection by enforcing safety standards, providing necessary training, and advocating for workers' rights. Sammy's reliance on union membership to advance in his profession implies that he is in a field where worker safety and protection are highly valued, such as the construction business. Therefore, considering the role and importance of labor unions in the construction business, and the necessity of union membership for career advancement mentioned in the question, it is safe to conclude that Sammy's profession is within the construction industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available options: A). no B). yes","output":"A) No  These two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question is about identifying famous Tamil punch dialogues of Surya, a particular actor in the Tamil film industry. Surya is known for his powerful and memorable dialogues, so this question is asking for examples of his best lines from his movies. The person asking this question would expect responses to specifically feature the actor Surya. The second question is broader in scope. It is asking for the best Tamil punch dialogue from recent times. Although this could potentially include dialogues uttered by Surya, it could also include dialogues by any other actor or from any other movie in the Tamil film industry. So, the second question is not specifically about Surya, and it takes into consideration a larger span of dialogues – essentially from every recent Tamil movie. Therefore, even though these questions are about similar topics, they are not paraphrases because they are asking for different kinds of information. Paraphrases are restatements of the same information in a different manner, but these two questions are querying distinct pieces of information: one about a specific actor's dialogues and the other about recent influential dialogues from the entire Tamil movie industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a \\"50% loss in revenue\\" and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%.

Context: Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself.

На русском: Будучи человеком, которым было отведено ключевое участие в формировании экономической политики в Соединенных Штатах, я постоянно наблюдал рассогласованность между политическими курсами, которые Америка пропагандирует в развивающихся странах, и идеями, которые реализуются не дома. Один из наиболее ярких примеров такой неконсистентности - \\"Вашингтонский консенсус\\". Этот термин, предложенный экономистом Джоном Уильямсоном, описывает ряд стандартных рекомендаций для развивающихся стран, предлагаемых Международным валютным фондом и Всемирным банком. Основные принципы данного консенсуса заключаются в дерегулировании и рыночных реформах, приватизации государственных компаний, открытии экономики мировому рынку и ориентации на экспорт. Вместе с тем, в внутренней экономической политике США массивные государственные вложения и субсидии часто сосуществуют с рыночными реформами. Это противоречит рекомендациям, предлагаемым странам-реципиентам. В частности, такие инструменты, как субсидии и защита отечественных производителей, уверенно позволили многим американским компаниям занять доминирующее положение на мировом рынке.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the man who's participation was believed to be confirmed by Gonzaga princes in the opera that omits La messaggera in the 1609 score? is inside the article: In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza., can you guess it ? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the text, the full name of the man who's participation was believed to be confirmed by Gonzaga princes in the opera that omits La messaggera in the 1609 score is Giovanni Gualberto Magli.

Trivia question: The alcoholic drink Absinthe originated in which European country? And the answer is?","output":"The alcoholic drink Absinthe originated in Switzerland, specifically in the Val-de-Travers region located in the canton of Neuchâtel. The green-hued spirit, popularly known as the \\"Green Fairy,\\" can be traced back to the late 18th century and was initially produced as an elixir for medicinal purposes. Absinthe is a distilled, highly alcoholic drink made from a combination of botanicals such as wormwood, green anise, and sweet fennel, among other herbs and spices. The key ingredient in absinthe is wormwood, which contains the psychoactive substance thujone. It is this ingredient that has given absinthe a controversial reputation over the years primarily because of the psychoactive effects thujone may have when present at high concentrations. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Absinthe became increasingly popular among artists, writers, and intellectuals in Europe, adding to its mystique as an inspiring and mind-altering beverage. Notable figures such as Ernest Hemingway, Vincent van Gogh, and Oscar Wilde were known to indulge in the Green Fairy. Absinthe was consumed as part of a ritual that involved dripping cold water through a sugar cube resting on a slotted spoon, which was placed over the glass holding the absinthe. The cold water caused the absinthe to 'louche' or turn a milky, opalescent greenish color, releasing the drink's aromatic flavors. Despite its cultural impact, absinthe's alleged hallucinogenic effects and potential for addiction led to widespread controversy, resulting in bans in several countries, including the United States and France, in the early 20th century. Over time, the bans were lifted and absinthe has made a resurgence in the modern era. It is now legally available in the United States and other countries, although thujone levels are regulated. In conclusion, absinthe originated in Switzerland and gradually gained international popularity, particularly among artists, writers, and the bohemian crowd in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The drink's complex history and controversial status have contributed to its enduring allure, and today, it continues to be appreciated for its unique flavor and cultural significance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — With gas prices pushing 4 a gallon, a lot of people are trying to stretch their dollar at the gas pump, but some of them are trying to stretch it a little too far.      Since the beginning of March, AAA has seen an 18 percent increase in the number of roadside calls for people running out of gas.      “I never put a lot in because I can’t afford to fill it up,” Leo Greek, a stranded motorist, said.      He says he’s not even sure how much it would cost to fill up his truck these days because he hasn’t done it for a while. He gets only what he needs and today he underestimated.      “It’s frustrating,” Greek said. “I can’t believe it has to be that expensive, but I know everybody’s going through it.”      According to AAA, gas prices in the Pittsburgh area have gone up 26 cents per gallon in the last month.      “Before it was more absentminded than anything else,” Jim Krebs with Brighton Service said. “But now, I believe that’s what it is. I believe people are like, ‘Man, I got to buy something else so I’m not going to put gas in the car. I should be able to make it,’ and they don’t.”      RELATED LINKS      More Local News      More Consumer News      More Reports By Lynne Hayes-Freeland      AAA Fuel Gauge Report      GasBuddy.com ||||| With gas prices climbing and little relief in sight, President Barack Obama is scrambling to get ahead of the latest potential obstacle to his re-election bid, even as Republicans are making plans to exploit the issue.      President Barack Obama salutes as he steps off Marine One helicopter before his departure from Los Angeles International airport in Los Angeles, Friday, April 22, 2011. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press)      President Barack Obama walks from the White House in Washington, Saturday, April 23, 2011, to his limo, for an afternoon of golf at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (Associated Press)      No one seems more aware of the electoral peril than Obama himself.      \\"My poll numbers go up and down depending on the latest crisis, and right now gas prices are weighing heavily on people,\\" he told Democratic donors in Los Angeles this past week.      In fact, Obama raised the issue unsolicited in a series of town meetings in Virginia, California and Nevada that were ostensibly about his deficit-reduction plan. And he made the gas spike the subject of his weekly radio and Internet address Saturday.      \\"It's just another burden when things were already pretty tough,\\" he said.      As Obama well knows, Americans love their cars and remain heavily dependent on them, and they don't hesitate to punish politicians when the cost of filling their tanks goes through the roof. Indeed, for presidents, responding to sudden surges is a recurring frustration.      \\"These gas prices are killing you right now,\\" Obama said at Facebook headquarters in California, acknowledging that many Americans can't afford new fuel-efficient cars and must drive older models.. For some, he said, the cost of a fill-up has all but erased the benefit of the payroll tax holiday that he and congressional Republicans agreed on last December.      On Saturday, Obama insisted in his radio and Internet address that the best answer is a long-term drive to develop alternatives to fossil fuel. He also renewed calls to end 4 billion in subsidies for oil and gas companies. \\"Instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy sources,\\" he said, \\"we need to invest in tomorrow's.\\"      Republicans contend that high gas prices are the inevitable result of an administration they accuse of stifling domestic drilling, and which placed new curbs on offshore exploration after last spring's disastrous BP oil spill.      \\"The administration has declared what can only be described as a war on American energy,\\" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.      \\"Obama is vulnerable on gas prices and the Republicans have and will exploit this as a wedge issue,\\" said James Thurber, who directs the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University.      Legislative aides report House Republicans are considering a series of hearings and floor votes on measures to boost domestic oil and gas production when Congress returns from its Easter break.      Meantime, Obama has ordered his Justice Department to form a task force to look for fraud or manipulation in the oil markets. It will \\"root out\\" any abuses, he told a town meeting in Reno, Nev. The president is among those who've said the surging price for crude is caused by worries about political upheaval in the Arab world and increasing demand from China and elsewhere.      Still, Americans have a tradition of holding the party in power responsible for rising gas costs.      Obama's focus on the issue came as a New York Times/CBS News poll published Thursday found that 70 percent of the public believes the country is headed in the wrong direction. That followed a March AP-GfK survey reflecting widespread discontent over the economy, with just 15 percent seeing an economic improvement the previous month. Through the spring, Obama's approval numbers in several polls have slipped.      \\"Gas prices are a major factor in his slide ... along with unemployment and his talk about cuts and tax increases to deal with deficits and debt,\\" Thurber said.      The national average price for a gallon (about 3.8 liters) of regular gasoline is currently 3.84, almost a dollar higher than a year ago. In many places, it's well over 4.      The gas price debate has a sense of deja vu to it, Obama notes. Vows to end dependence on expensive oil imports go back to Richard Nixon's \\"Project Independence\\", a 1973 response to the Arab oil embargo, and this has been a popular refrain by presidents of both parties over the last 40 years.      \\"Whenever gas prices shoot up, like clockwork, you see politicians racing to the cameras, waving three-point plans for two dollar gas,\\" Obama said in Saturday's address. But when prices subside, those plans are quietly shelved.      Even calls to target price gouging have a familiar ring. When gas hit 3 a gallon in 2006, George W. Bush launched a probe, declaring Americans \\"don't want and will not accept ... manipulation of the market. And neither will I.\\"      Seven months later, Bush took what he called a \\"thumping\\" in mid-term elections. Of course, other issues _ especially Iraq _ played a big role. But Obama can't help pondering that example, and wondering what rising gas prices could do to his hopes for a second term. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article discusses the impact of rising gas prices on American citizens and the potential political consequences for President Barack Obama. As gas prices reach close to 4 a gallon, there has been an 18% increase in roadside calls for people running out of gas since March.

Question: Question: The stabbing to death of a person is likely to create what on the ground? Options: - pool of blood - being arrested - garden - imprisonment - gruesome  Explain why a human would choose \\"pool of blood\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"pool of blood\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Understanding the context: The question describes a violent event that results in the death of a person through stabbing. This context immediately rules out options like \\"garden\\" and \\"imprisonment\\" which are unrelated to the direct consequence of the violent act. 2. Analyzing the options: From the remaining options - \\"pool of blood,\\" \\"being arrested,\\" and \\"gruesome\\" - a human would identify \\"pool of blood\\" as the most logical and direct result of a stabbing. 3. Cause and effect: Stabbing an individual can cause a significant amount of bleeding due to damage to blood vessels and tissues. As the person bleeds out, the blood would accumulate on the ground, creating a pool of blood. This cause-and-effect relationship leads a human to choose \\"pool of blood\\" as the answer. 4. Focus on immediate outcome: While \\"being arrested\\" and \\"gruesome\\" are also related to the scenario, they are not as directly linked to the stabbing itself. \\"Being arrested\\" is a potential legal consequence for the perpetrator, which comes after the stabbing event. \\"Gruesome\\" is a description of the scene, not a specific outcome. Thus, \\"pool of blood\\" remains the most accurate and direct answer to the question. By considering context, analyzing options, understanding the cause-and-effect relationship, and focusing on the immediate outcome, a human would choose \\"pool of blood\\" as the answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  Paragraph: John and Keith were playing football - the game was rough to say the least. They both got hurt. After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who would not have neutrophils on his wound, John or Keith? Answer:","output":"Keith would not have neutrophils on his wound.  As described in the background information, inflammation is a response of the body to infections or injuries. It is marked by redness, warmth, and pain in the affected area. Inflammation occurs as a result of chemicals being released when skin or other tissues are damaged. These chemicals cause blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the damaged area. Importantly, these chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound site, causing the neutrophils to leak out of blood vessels and into the damaged tissue. In the given paragraph, John and Keith were playing a rough game of football and both got injured. During their check-up with the sports physician, it was found that John had inflammation, while Keith did not. Given this information, it can be deduced that it is John's wound that has neutrophils present, as his body has initiated the inflammatory response to deal with the injury. On the other hand, Keith's lack of inflammation indicates that his wound has not triggered the same response, meaning that neutrophils have not been attracted to his wound site. Therefore, Keith would not have neutrophils on his wound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition?  Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to... The answer to this question is:","output":"Rosebery. The former Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, is mentioned in the article as one of those approached by Shackleton for financial support for his expedition plans. However, he did not offer any help, stating bluntly: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\". Despite his enormous achievements and public acclaim that followed the Nimrod Expedition from 1907-1909, Shackleton found that raising funds for his Antarctic explorations continued to pose a significant challenge. Lord Rosebery's refusal to contribute financially is a demonstration of the difficulties the explorer would have faced during these preparations. Thus, Rosebery is the last name of the former Prime Minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: Given two entities as input, classify as \\"yes\\" if second entity is the part of the first entity. Otherwise classify them as \\"no\\". These are entities of meronym In linguistics, meronymy is a semantic relation between a meronym denoting a part and a holonym denoting a whole. In simpler terms, a meronym (i.e., second entity) is in a part-of relationship with its holonym (i.e., first entity). Problem:Entity 1: cockroach   Entity 2: leg Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understand the concept of meronym. Usage: A meronym is a semantic term that represents a part of a whole. For example, \\"wheel\\" is a meronym of \\"car\\" because a wheel is a part of a car. This meets the criteria because we have a whole (car) and a part (wheel) in a part-of relationship. Part #2: Understand the concept of holonym. Usage: A holonym is a semantic term that represents a whole to which parts (meronyms) belong. For example, \\"car\\" is a holonym of \\"wheel\\" because a car is the whole to which the wheel belongs. This meets the criteria because we have a whole (car) and a part (wheel) in a part-of relationship. Part #3: Identify and classify the input entities. Usage: Input: Entity 1: cockroach; Entity 2: leg. Since a leg is a part of a cockroach, we classify this pair of entities as \\"yes\\" according to the meronym-holonym relationship. This meets the criteria because the second entity (leg) is a part of the first entity (cockroach). Part #4: If the second entity is not a part of the first entity, classify them as \\"no\\". Usage: Input: Entity 1: car; Entity 2: wing. Since a wing is not a part of a car, we classify this pair of entities as \\"no.\\" This meets the criteria because the second entity (wing) is not a part of the first entity (car)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. Erdogan was born in 1954 in the Kasimpasa neighborhood of Istanbul, to which his family had moved from Rize Province. His parents are Ahmet Erdogan and Tenzile Erdogan. Erdogan reportedly said in 2003, \\"I'm a Georgian, my family is a Georgian family which migrated from Batumi to Rize.\\" But in a 2014 televised interview on the NTV news network, he said, \\"You wouldn't believe the things they have said about me. They have said I am Georgian... forgive me for saying this... even much uglier things, they have even called me an Armenian, but I am Turkish.\\" In an account based on registry records, his genealogy was tracked to an ethnic Turkish family.  Erdogan spent his early childhood in Rize, where his father Ahmet Erdogan (1905 - 1988) was a Captain in the Turkish Coast Guard. Erdogan had a brother Mustafa (b. 1958) and sister Vesile (b. 1965). His summer holidays were mostly spent in Guneysu, Rize, where his family originates from. Throughout his life he often returned to this spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a mountaintop near this village. The family returned to Istanbul when Erdogan was 13 years old.  As a teenager, he sold lemonade and sesame buns (simit) on the streets of the city's rougher districts to earn extra money. Brought up in an observant Muslim family, Erdogan graduated from Kasimpasa Piyale primary school in 1965, and Imam Hatip school, a religious vocational high school, in 1973. He received his high school diploma from Eyup High School. He subsequently studied Business Administration at the Aksaray School of Economics and Commercial Sciences, now known as Marmara University's Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences--although several Turkish sources dispute that he graduated.  In his youth, Erdogan played semi-professional football at a local club. Fenerbahce wanted him to transfer to the club but his father prevented it. The stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew up, Kasimpasa S.K. is named after him.  Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran (born 1955, Siirt) on 4 July 1978. They have two sons; Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal, and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye. His father, Ahmet Erdogan, died in 1988 and his 88-year-old mother, Tenzile Erdogan, died in 2011. He is a member of the Community of Iskenderpasa, a Turkish sufistic community of Naqshbandi tariqah. What sport did Erdogan play?","output":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the current President of Turkey, was engaged in sports during his youth. He played semi-professional football at a local club. His skill in the game was noted to the extent that Fenerbahce, a prominent club in Turkey, even wanted him to transfer to their club. However, his father prevented this transition. It is worth noting the considerable influence this sport had in his early life, as the local football club where he grew up, Kasimpasa S.K., even named their stadium after him, acknowledging his contribution and connection with the sport. This active involvement in football during his youth contributes to the multidimensional aspects of President Erdogan's personality, showcasing a balance between avid interest in sports and his dedication to political service captured throughout his life trajectory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Given the context provided, it is impossible to predict with absolute certainty what Alex will do next. However, we can generate a few potential scenarios based on the information given, which is that Alex is comfortable doing well in school.  Scenario 1: Continuing to Excel Academically Since Alex is comfortable doing good in school, it is highly likely that they will continue to focus on their studies, engage in activities that promote academic growth, and maintain their strong academic performance. This could involve Alex participating in study groups, seeking additional help from teachers when necessary, or taking advantage of school resources such as tutoring or after-school programs. Scenario 2: Pursuing Extracurricular Activities Alex may also decide to expand their horizons in other areas complementary to their academic achievements, such as participating in extracurricular activities. They might join a sports team, become involved in student government, or participate in a club related to their interests. These activities could not only help Alex build critical skills such as teamwork, leadership and problem-solving but could also assist in broadening their social network, making new friends or connections with people who share similar interests. Scenario 3: Setting Long-term Goals and Planning for the Future Another potential path for Alex could involve setting long-term goals related to their education or career aspirations. Given their academic success, it is possible that Alex envisions attending college or pursuing a particular career path. In this case, Alex might focus on acquiring information about potential colleges, scholarships, or internships to better understand the necessary steps to achieve these goals. Scenario 4: Giving Back and Helping Others With a strong academic foundation, Alex may realize that they can share their knowledge and support other students who may be struggling or seeking guidance. They might volunteer at their school as a tutor, work as a teaching assistant, or consider mentoring younger students. In turn, this would allow Alex to develop valuable interpersonal and communication skills and potentially find personal satisfaction in helping others succeed. While it is impossible to predict exactly which path Alex will choose, these scenarios offer insight into potential directions that they may take based on their comfort and success in school. Ultimately, the decision will depend on Alex's unique interests, priorities, and personal aspirations. Regardless of the path chosen, their commitment to academic success can open up multiple opportunities and influence their future positively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
