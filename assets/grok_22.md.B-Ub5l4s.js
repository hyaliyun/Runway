Question: Given the following context:  Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997. Although...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose departure from the band caused another band member to leave?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Theodore John Kaczynski (; born May 22, 1942), also known as the Unabomber, is an American domestic terrorist. A mathematics prodigy, he abandoned an academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle, then between 1978 and 1995 he killed three people, and injured 23 others, in a nationwide bombing campaign targeting those involved with modern technology. In conjunction, he issued a social critique opposing industrialization and advancing a nature-centered form of anarchism. At Harvard, Kaczynski lived during his first year at 8 Prescott Street, which was designed to accommodate the youngest, most precocious freshmen in a small, intimate living space. The next three years he lived at Eliot House. One of his suitemates there recalled that he avoided contact with others and \\"would just rush through the suite, go into his room, and slam the door.\\" Another suitemate said Kaczynski was reserved, but regarded him as a genius: \\"It's just an opinion - but Ted was brilliant.\\" Other students stated Kaczynski was less socially averse than these descriptions imply; an Eliot House resident who dined with Kaczynski at times called him \\"very quiet, but personable ... He would enter into the discussions maybe a little less so than most [but] he was certainly friendly.\\"  As a sophomore, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alton Chase as a \\"purposely brutalizing psychological experiment\\", led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student, and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who in a later session would confront and belittle the subject - making \\"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\\" attacks - using the content of the essays as ammunition, while electrodes monitored the subject's physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects' expressions of rage were later played back to them repeatedly. The experiment ultimately lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week. In total, Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study. Kaczynski's lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to this experience. Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of the US government's research into mind control, known as Project MKUltra. Chase and others have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski's criminal activities, while philosopher Jonathan D. Moreno has said that, while \\"Kaczynski's anti-technological fixation and his critique itself had some roots in the Harvard curriculum,\\" Kaczynski's later bombing campaign can \\"by no means be laid at Harvard's door\\".  Kaczynski earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1962. He finished with an above-average 3.12 GPA but had been expected to perform better. what else happened during the experiment?","output":"Ted Kaczynski was involved in a psychological experiment during his time at Harvard. The study, led by psychologist Henry Murray, was quite intense and challenging for those involved, including Kaczynski. They were asked to write essays about their personal beliefs and then faced an anonymous attorney who would aggressively attack and belittle them using the content of their essays. During the experiment, the participants had their reactions to these confrontations monitored, with their angry expressions being recorded. Later, these videos were played back to them repeatedly, which might have been a way to further provoke their emotional reactions. Some people think that this harsh and difficult experience may have influenced Kaczynski's later actions as the Unabomber. However, it is important to remember that many things can happen in a person's life, and not everything can be directly connected to one specific event or experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trailing 17-0, McNabb found fullback Thomas Tapeh in the end zone. A short touchdown pass to Reggie Brown brought the Eagles to within three. The Bucs added a field goal, making it 20-14.

This implies that the shampoo's formulation was specifically designed to address the needs and demands of the target audience, resulting in higher performance and effectiveness as compared to the soap. As a product from a reputable brand, the shampoo likely underwent rigorous research and development processes, focusing on aspects such as cleansing, nourishing, and conditioning the hair, among others. It might have been enriched with natural and premium-quality ingredients, like plant extracts and essential oils, especially formulated to cater to diverse hair types and textures. Furthermore, it would have been tested and perfected in state-of-the-art laboratories, ensuring the right balance and compatibility of its components for optimal results. Conversely, while the soap may also have been from a well-known brand, it was not specifically tailored for hair care. Soaps are generally created for cleaning the body and possess a more alkaline pH, which may negatively impact the hair's cuticles and potentially strip away the hair's essential oils, leading to dryness, brittleness, or even damage. Shampoos, on the other hand, are made with a milder formulation that preserves the hair's natural moisture, preventing damage and promoting overall hair health. Moreover, the shampoo's brand reputation not only implies high-quality ingredients but also signifies that consumers place their trust in its product offerings. This particular brand likely has a long-standing history of delivering effective and reliable hair care solutions, which is evident in its customers' loyalty and satisfaction with the results. In conclusion, the shampoo worked a lot better than the soap mainly because it was developed by a well-known brand with expertise in hair care. This expertise is a testament to the brand's ability to innovate and create products that target specific haircare needs and concerns, ensuring that the shampoo provides superior performance compared to the soap, which is designed for general body cleansing rather than hair care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What causes the development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls?, Context: Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.","output":"The development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls is caused by the surge in hormone production during puberty. This hormonal surge is triggered by the pituitary gland, which releases hormonal agents into the bloodstream, causing a chain reaction.

He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene. The final day of filming involves a complicated stunt where Cameron has to drive a vintage Duesenberg off a bridge. Nina has two other scenes to shoot as well, but Cameron is convinced Eli will rig the stunt so he will die. He persuades Nina to run away with him, but they are unable to leave the set, which is kept sealed from the neighboring town by the police on Eli's orders.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Stunt Man,\\" the boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as the eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross, exercises godlike control over the production. The protagonist, Cameron, is often unsure of what is real and what is staged, leading to confusion and suspicion about the true intentions of the director and the events happening within the movie production. This blending of reality and fiction contributes to the film's overall atmosphere of uncertainty and manipulation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who had the most yards in touchdown passes over the entire game?","output":"Title: Uncovering the Quarterback with the Most Yards in Touchdown Passes Over a Single Game Introduction: In the world of American football, the quarterback holds a particularly important position as the team's biggest offensive weapon. A talented QB can almost single-handedly carry his team to a thrilling victory by throwing long, accurate pass plays. But, have you ever wondered which quarterback holds the impressive record of having the most yards in touchdown passes over a single game? This article will dive into the history books, explore the exploits of iconic QBs, and reveal the record holder for this impressive feat. Breaking Records: The History of American Football: Before delving into the identity of the quarterback who achieved this seemingly insurmountable record, let's first look at how the sport has evolved. American football can trace its roots back to the latter half of the 19th century when it branched off from the games of association football and rugby. Throughout the decades, the sport has continued to develop and grow in popularity, as have the records broken on the field. The National Football League (NFL) began in 1920 and has since become the preeminent professional league for American football. Talented quarterbacks who have left a mark on the field are names like Joe Montana, Johnny Unitas, and Peyton Manning. These legends have shattered statistical benchmarks and won numerous accolades. However, the quarterback we are most interested in the context of this article is neither a Montana nor a Unitas. The Record Holder: Norm Van Brocklin's Historic Game: On September 28, 1951, Norm Van Brocklin, an accomplished quarterback playing for the Los Angeles Rams, forever etched his name in NFL history. In a game against the New York Yanks at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, contemporaneously referred to as \\"the Dutchman,\\" Van Brocklin uncorked an astonishing aerial performance that remains unmatched to this day. Over the course of that single game, Van Brocklin threw for a jaw-dropping 554 passing yards, accumulating five touchdown passes in the process. This stunning display of skill and athleticism earned him the record for the most yards in touchdown passes over a single game. Van Brocklin's performance contributed to the Rams' 54-14 rout of the Yanks. Van Brocklin's Record: Resilience Over the Decades: Despite the game having evolved, featuring bigger and faster athletes, improved technology, and advanced strategy, Van Brocklin's record remains unbeaten. Quarterbacks such as Warren Moon, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees have all come exceptionally close to surpassing the record but have fallen short by a few dozen yards. However, the fact that Van Brocklin's feat has persevered for seven decades is a testament to its rarity and brilliance. What made Van Brocklin's performance even more remarkable was his overall career achievements. As a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and a two-time NFL champion, Norm Van Brocklin's inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is no surprise. Conclusion: Records in sports offer a snapshot of extraordinary, singular moments of athletic achievement. Even though many NFL records have been rewritten over the years, some stand the test of time, indicative of their brilliance. Norm Van Brocklin's incredibly successful career and his seemingly untouchable 554-yard passing game make him the unyielding answer to the question: Who had the most yards in touchdown passes over the entire game? After all, the flying Dutchman soars high, just like the passes he once threw."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One way to do this is by taking care of your skin, hair, and using makeup. This article will tell you some ways to do that! 1. Work on having flawless skin To have nice, smooth skin, it's important to keep it clean and healthy. Here's how you can do that: - Wash your face every day with water and a gentle soap to get rid of dirt and germs. - Put on sunscreen when you go outside to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays. - Don't touch your face too much, because your hands might have germs on them. - Drink lots of water to stay hydrated and help your skin look its best. 2. Get the makeup Makeup can be fun to play with, but it's important to use it the right way. Using too much can cause skin problems like pimples, and it's not safe to share makeup with other people because it can spread germs. Here are some tips for using makeup: - Use makeup that's made for kids, like products with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. - Only use a little bit of makeup, and always wash it off before bedtime. - Make sure to check with a grown-up before trying any makeup products. 3. Use your natural beauty Every person is beautiful in their own way, and it's important to embrace our unique traits. Here's how you can show off your natural beauty: - Smile! A big, happy smile makes everyone look and feel more beautiful. - Take good care of your skin and hair by keeping them clean and healthy. - Wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself and show off your personality. 4. Don't forget your hair! Hair is a big part of how we look and feel. To keep your hair looking great, follow these steps: - Brush or comb your hair every day to keep it tangle-free and neat. - Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner about 2-3 times a week, depending on your hair type. - Try fun hairstyles, like braids or ponytails, to keep your hair looking cute and stylish. 5. Is tanning trendy? Tanning is when you sit in the sun to make your skin darker. Although some people think having a tan makes them look good, the sun can actually be harmful to your skin. Here's why: - The sun gives off ultraviolet (UV) rays that can cause sunburns and even skin cancer later in life. - Tanning can make your skin dry and wrinkly before you're grown up. It's better to protect your skin with sunscreen and stay in the shade instead of trying to get a tan. Remember, it's most important to be comfortable in your own skin and embrace your natural beauty! That's it! By taking care of your skin, hair, and using makeup wisely, you can look and feel your best every day. Always remember that each person's beauty is unique and special in its own way, so be proud of who you are!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article: A new study suggests that the way to weight loss may be clear.A couple of glasses of water before meals help dieters lose about 5 pounds more than those who do not drink water.While drinking water before a meal may fill a person up,the contents of their meal are important as well.Should a person be eating a low-fat diet or a lowcarbohydrate   diet? Or does it matter at all? Recent research suggests that one diet isn't any better than the other.A few weeks before the water study,another concluded that lowfat and lowcarbohydrate diets tied in weight loss.While the lowcarbohydrate dieters did show a slight increase in good cholesterol   and a reduction in blood pressure,there was not much difference in the dieters'weight loss.The point here is that the person had to stick to the diet.What helps a person see a diet through? It could be body type. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,as reported byTimemagazine,found that body shape is the key to which diet a person will be able to stick with.Apples are people who carry most of their weight above the belt,while pears carry their weight around their hips  .Apple types were more likely to be highinsulin secretors   who respond more strongly to carbohydrates in their bodies.They lost the most weight on a lowcarbohydrate diet.Pears were lowinsulin secretors who lost the same amount of weight on both diets.Unstable   insulin levels can create stronger hunger senses,causing the apple types to go off their diet plans. All of these studies again come down to choosing the diet that helps you eat less.The bodytype diet does make some sense as men are more likely to be apple types,with larger stomachs,and tend to do well on higherprotein diets,while women,who tend to carry weight around their hips,find themselves drawn to the lowfat diets.The reality is if a diet is failing you try another one.A plan you can't,or won't,stick to will never work,no matter what the research says.

Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While the two sentences appear similar at first glance and convey related information, they differ in some specific aspects, and thus they don't convey exactly the same information. Sentence 1: The museum building maintains its European style of oriental modern architecture through the standing bricks on the south-eastern corner of the building and the classical image of the foyer.    This sentence emphasizes that the museum building maintains a \\"European style\\" of oriental modern architecture. It states that this style is preserved by the standing bricks at the south-eastern corner of the building and the \\"classical image\\" of the foyer. The description suggests the foyer has a traditional or historically significant appearance. Sentence 2: The museum building retains its classical style of oriental modern architecture through the standing bricks on the southeast corner of the building and the European image of the foyer. This sentence, on the other hand, highlights that the museum building retains a \\"classical style\\" of oriental modern architecture. It discusses the preservation of the style through the standing bricks at the southeast corner of the building. The difference here is that it talks about the \\"European image\\" of the foyer, implying the foyer has a predominantly European-inspired appearance. In summary, the primary differences between the two sentences lie in the attributes assigned to the museum's architectural style and the foyer's design. Sentence 1 describes the museum as having a European style of oriental modern architecture with a classical foyer, while Sentence 2 portrays the museum as possessing a classical style of oriental modern architecture with a European-inspired foyer. So, while both sentences convey similar ideas about the architectural features of the museum, they describe distinct aspects of the architecture and the foyer's design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we're going to find out how many touchdowns were scored in the first quarter of a football game.  First, let's learn what a touchdown is. A touchdown is when a team carries the football into the other team's end zone or catches it there. They get 6 points for scoring a touchdown, and it's a big deal because that gets the team closer to winning the game! A football game is divided into four parts called quarters. Each quarter is 15 minutes long, and the first quarter is the beginning of the game. That's the part we are focusing on today! Now, let's imagine we are watching a football game. The first quarter starts, and both teams are playing their best. During this time, we are going to count how many touchdowns happen.  But, right now, we don't have a specific football game to watch. So, we don't have the exact number of touchdowns in the first quarter for you. Each game is different, and the number can change from game to game. Sometimes, there could be a lot of touchdowns, and other times, there might be none at all! If you want to find out how many touchdowns were scored in the first quarter of a particular game, try this: 1. Ask a grown-up to help you find the game's score online or in a newspaper. 2. Look for the game's summary, which could show the touchdowns scored in each quarter. 3. Count the number of touchdowns in the first quarter, and there you have it! We hope you had fun learning about touchdowns and the first quarter of a football game.

Article: equal rites Gay Marriage All Goes According to Andrew Cuomo’s Plan      It all went according to plan. Oh, the two-week delay on a gay-marriage vote, the exact identities of the final Senate Republican “yes” voters — true, those frustrating twists and uncertainties weren’t pretty, and there were moments when the whole thing could have come crashing down. But to a remarkable degree, the same-sex marriage endgame unfolded just as Governor Andrew Cuomo had drawn it up months ago. And his \\"what-me-worry?\\" posture throughout the end-of-session mess was crucial in making it happen: Cuomo’s confidence game — his repeated public statements and private assurances to marriage advocates and legislative fence-sitters that legalization was inevitable, even when it wasn’t — created the climate for the last breakthrough today. Well, that and some good old-fashioned horse-trading.            Cuomo had outlined his big three legislative priorities last year, during his campaign for governor, and after pushing through a state budget in March he kept a tight focus on winning a property tax cap, tightening ethics rules, and passing gay marriage. Getting everything done required providing something for everyone: Upstate and suburban Republicans wanted the tax cap; city Democrats wanted rent regulations; and Cuomo, who believed in gay marriage in principle, also needed it politically to shore up his progressive credentials.      Just establishing the goals didn’t get them done, of course; Cuomo and his allies worked relentlessly to maintain the favorable momentum, from Cuomo’s approval-number-boosting roadshow to — pivotally, in the case of gay marriage — organizing a well-financed ground-game, run by his aide Steve Cohen and political consultant Jennifer Cunningham, that teamed with gay advocacy groups like Empire State Pride Agenda and the Human Rights Campaign to flood legislators with pro-marriage calls and mail. This paid off most spectacularly with the switch of Brooklyn Democrat Joe Addabbo from a “no” vote in 2009 to a “yes” this month, a necessary domino to bringing two other Dems and Republicans Jim Alesi and Roy McDonald on board.      But once Cuomo had established the fundamental architecture of the bargain, the rest was mere haggling: A shift in rent regulation numbers here, some significant loopholes in ethics rules there, plus a dash of extra legalese in the amendment to gay marriage. The new governor determined his strengths months ago, and pinpointed his colleagues' and opponents' weaknesses, and those things haven’t changed. He knew that Shelly Silver, the powerful Assembly speaker, needed to be able to claim improvements in protecting the tenants of rent-regulated apartments, but that otherwise Silver wouldn’t be the immovable object he’d been in the past. “How many times did Nancy Pelosi, when she was speaker of the house, tell Obama to go to hell?” a top New York Democrat asks. “Not often. It doesn’t really work that way. And in Albany, a Democratic speaker doesn’t really want trouble with a Democratic governor. A Republican governor, Pataki — yes, then the Democratic speaker is the counterforce. An immature, eccentric governor, Spitzer? Sure. A weak governor, Paterson? Shelly consumes a weak governor. But right now you have a popular Democratic governor. Shelly doesn’t want to start a fight of who is more popular and who has more sway with the Assembly.” Once Silver got some incremental improvements in tenant laws he was willing to play ball on the property tax cap, the priority for Republican senate majority leader Dean Skelos.      Which left the minor matter of gay marriage itself. The decisive votes needed to come from Skelos’s conference, which was split between two factions: A solid majority opposed to legalization who didn’t want to allow the vote to come to the floor, and a handful of undecideds who were fearful of being the 32nd “yes” that would put marriage over the top and expose them to the vengeance of the Conservative Party. Skelos, to the end, couldn’t make up his mind what he wanted to do. He could allow a vote and get the issue over with, thereby risking his party’s thin hold on the senate, or stall indefinitely, satisfying the bulk of his membership.      “The Republican leadership has promised (Conservative Party Chairman) Mike Long that it won’t put the thumb on individual legislators to decide it,” a GOP insider said mid-week. “So they have these tortured conferences where people are pretty anguished. Senators say, ‘I don’t want to be a bigot, but my church and my priest say I shouldn’t be doing this!’ A significant portion of the meeting the other day was venting at Alesi, especially, and McDonald, who they felt broke the proctocol.” Alesi, in particular, wallowed in the spotlight after declaring he’d vote yes, and angered his fellow Republicans by saying he was voting on principle while they resorted to craven political calculation. “In the meetings, they told him, ‘Nobody holds it against you that you’re in favor of this issue or that issue, but who are you to go out and indict the whole conference? You’re full of shit! You’re portraying my serious wrestling with this issue as some kind of cavalier political thing, and I take great offense to that!’”      All this pontificating took up many hours, and could have continued indefinitely. Cuomo knew from the beginning that Republicans would use questions about protecting religious institutions as a delaying tactic, and that he couldn't depend on Skelos to deliver the last votes. So Cuomo kept working on individual Republicans, and he strategically gave ground, until late Friday, when his last bit of concession on religious exemptions tipped the balance for Sen. Stephen Saland, who represents a district near Albany. Cuomo felt confident of Saland's vote a week ago, but knew he needed to give the senator slightly more room to justify the decision to the Republican conference and to his constituents.      \\"You’ve got a governor who from New York City who shouldn’t be wildly popular upstate, but he is,\\" a Cuomo insider says. \\"So legislators take comfort in the fact that he’s out there so hard on this issue. You took a tough vote for David Paterson? Shame on you! You took a tough vote for Andrew Cuomo? God bless you!\\" The repeated, emphatic waving of campaign money by gay groups didn’t hurt, either. “It’s carrots and sticks. It’s music and champagne — and it’s strength,” a Cuomo intimate says. “It’s an orchestra, it’s a symphony, it’s all of this combined. It’s political skills. It’s 500 phone calls to individual senators. It’s birthday calls, it’s anniversary calls, it’s going to their district, it’s all last year campaigning with them.”      “Andrew has been masterful,” a political strategist says. “Whether health care or ethics or Medicaid reductions, they announce victory, stand with the partners in a room — and then they work out the details later.” So it was with gay marriage; it will be some time until all the fine print is digested, and perhaps the last round of maneuvering will open up the law to serious legal challenges, but Cuomo will worry about that another day. He's gotten the big win, and it will be very hard for anyone to turn back the clock. (A digression: Yes, Mike Bloomberg has been a longtime and aggressive supporter of gay marriage, but otherwise he and the city took a beating in Albany this session. From LIFO to the slashing of education funds to the meager improvements in rent regulations to the punting of pension reductions, Cuomo has recognized and exploited his political advantages over the mayor at every turn . The state’s new reduction in union benefits may have a ripple benefit for Bloomberg, but it’s a big maybe. And okay, Bloomberg did get an Albany win on livery cabs.) ||||| Striking what advocates believe is a historic victory for gay rights, New York on Friday approved same-sex marriage, making the Empire State the sixth and largest state to allow gays and lesbians to marry.      The 33-29 state Senate vote is an enormous victory for first-year Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who pledged during last fall’s campaign to push for gay marriage. It comes after an intense public and private lobbying campaign from a wide cast of politicians, celebrities and athletes, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton.      Text Size -      +      reset Cuomo cheers marriage vote POLITICO 44      Cuomo, whose two daughters attended the vote in the Senate gallery, signed the bill five minutes before midnight after a victory lap press conference. It will go into effect July 24, and when it does, the population of Americans for whom same-sex marriage is legal will double.      Cuomo after the vote said New York has continued its legacy as a beacon for social justice movements.      “The other states look to New York for the progressive direction,” Cuomo said. “What we said today is, you look to New York once again. New York made a powerful statement, not just for the people of New York, but for people all across this nation.”      After weeks of suspense, Stephen Saland, a Poughkeepsie Republican, announced himself on the Senate floor as the 32nd senator to back the legislation, tipping the balance in favor of it passing. Saland defined his vote as a matter of conscience during a stirring legal defense of an amendment exempting religious organizations from the law.      “I have defined doing the right thing as treating all persons with equality,” Saland said. “And that equality includes the definition of marriage. I fear that to do otherwise would fly in the face of my upbringing.”      Saland, who voted against gay marriage in 2009, was joined in announcing his newfound support for gay marriage on the senate floor by Mark Grisanti, a first-term Buffalo Republican who did not declare how he would vote until his floor speech Friday night. Grisanti, who said he struggled with the vote because he is Catholic, had been against same-sex marriage when he was elected last year, but changed his mind after an intense lobbying campaign, which included a call from Lady Gaga to her fans to contact him.      “I cannot legally come up with an argument against same-sex marriage,” Grisanti said.      Of the 33 senators to vote for the bill, 29 are Democrats and four are Republicans. Of the 29 who voted against it, all but one are Republicans.      Cuomo, who is scheduled to speak at 11:15 p.m., lauded the vote in a press release.      “New York has finally torn down the barrier that has prevented same-sex couples from exercising the freedom to marry and from receiving the fundamental protections that so many couples and families take for granted,” he said. “With the world watching, the Legislature, by a bipartisan vote, has said that all New Yorkers are equal under the law. With this vote, marriage equality will become a reality in our state, delivering long overdue fairness and legal security to thousands of New Yorkers.”      The Senate bill’s sponsor, openly gay Democrat Tom Duane of Manhattan, introduced the legislation with a tearful speech detailing his life from when he came out to his Catholic parents as a teen to his adult life fighting for gay rights. He spoke of how his young nieces and nephews already consider he and his partner married, even if they are not in the eyes of the law.      “Marriage says that we are family,” Duane said. “Louis and I are family. And marriage strengthens all family. It’s going to strengthen my family and all New York families.”      The lone senator to speak against the legislation was Bronx Democrat Ruben Diaz Sr., a Pentecostal minister who is the body’s harshest critic of the legislation. Diaz blamed Senate Republicans, who voted en masse against legalizing gay marriage in 2009, for turning on the issue.      “It is unbelievable that the Republican Party, the party that always defended family values ... is allowing a Democratic governor to divide the Republican Party and the Conservative Party,” Diaz said. “Same-sex marriage has been rejected by the majority of Americans when given the opportunity to vote for it.”      And the National Organization for Marriage, which lobbied against legalizing gay nuptials, said the state Republican Party “has torn up its contract with the voters who trusted them in order to facilitate Cuomo’s bid to be president of the U.S.” |||||Summary:","output":"New York State legalized same-sex marriage in a historic vote that marked a significant victory for Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had promised to push for gay marriage during his campaign. The 33-29 state Senate vote saw a wide range of politicians, celebrities, and athletes lobby for the change, and New York became the sixth and largest state in the US to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry. Cuomo strategically focused on individual Republicans and made concessions on religious exemptions, which helped tip the balance for the vote. The passage of the bill reinforces New York's role as a progressive leader on social justice movements and bolsters Cuomo's progressive credentials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The  OPTIONS: (a). skillet had a lid and would cook faster.. (b). pan had a lid and would cook faster..","output":"The package said to cook the meat in a skillet, but Sally decided to use a pan instead. She carefully weighed her options before making this decision. On one hand, the skillet had a lid and would cook the meat faster, allowing her to retain more of the natural juices, which would give her meal that authentic, home-cooked flavor. Additionally, the skillet’s even heat distribution would ensure the meat cooked evenly, reducing the risk of any rawness. However, Sally was never one to strictly follow instructions, especially when she felt there might be a benefit to deviating from them. Her choice to use a pan instead of a skillet came with its own practical reasoning. First and foremost, her pan had a lid, which, like the skillet, could significantly reduce cooking time. The primary distinction was that her pan was slightly deeper and had more surface area. This allowed for the possibility of adding more ingredients, which could elevate the dish and make it her own. She considered combining the meat with vegetables or potatoes, making it a one-pot meal that would be both delicious and easy to clean up. Moreover, Sally was conscious of the fact that non-stick coatings in some of the skillets might have potential health concerns, especially when exposed to high temperatures. By opting for a pan with a stainless steel or cast iron surface, she could cook her dish confidently without these worries. Additionally, using a pan would give her more control over the cooking process, as it had sturdier handles, and she could effortlessly monitor the meat while the lid was still on. Lastly, Sally believed that engaging in creative cooking could lead to discovering new methods and techniques, which might even turn out better than the traditional method. As a food enthusiast and risk-taker, she trusted her instincts and understanding of the ingredients. She knew that sticking too closely to a recipe's instructions might prevent her from being able to develop her own unique culinary style. In conclusion, Sally's decision to use a pan instead of a skillet was based on a multitude of reasons. From practicalities like having a lid for faster cooking times and the potential to add more ingredients, to her own culinary preferences like avoiding non-stick pans and the desire for creative freedom in the kitchen, Sally put great thought into her choice to cook the meat in a pan. The outcome of her decision may very well have resulted in a more customized, delicious dish, proving once again that sometimes deviating from the norm can lead to extraordinary results."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.  Question: \\"What is the issue with the nave and why is the axis of the west front conflicting with it?\\" Answer: \\"The axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, sweetie. Based on the paragraph, the answer is correct. The nave is too wide for its height, so it doesn't match the axis of the west front.

Cameraman Huw Walters allegedly forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts. He denies three counts of fraud at Cardiff Crown Court. An award-winning cameraman forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts, before divorcing her, a court heard. Huw Talfryn Walters, 50, allegedly spent the money on buying expensive camera and photographic equipment. But the court heard the freelance cameraman kept his spiralling money problems secret from his wife, Helen Bowen. The case was brought before a new jury after the original jury failed to reach a majority verdict in March this year. Cardiff Crown Court heard yesterday how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. During one application, he wrote: 'We need these funds urgently, so your speed in these matters would be welcome.' He then ended their 14-year marriage after telling his wife he needed to put their house up for sale. Walters allegedly told Miss Bowers: 'I'm divorcing you because if I don't I'm going to go bankrupt.' Prosecutor John Davies said: 'Miss Bowen made a career change around 2005 and after that left the mortgage and bills to her husband who she trusted. 'They separated in December 2011 and not long after that she became aware the mortgage had increased without her agreement. 'She contacted the bank to obtain copies of the three withdrawals which increased the size of the mortgage by £59,000. 'She realised the signatures on them didn't belong to her - they were written by her husband without her knowledge while they still lived together.' Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including the BBC Proms, Doctor Who and Channel 4's history show Time Team. He has won two Welsh Baftas for his cinematography and camera work in recent years. The court heard Walters spent thousands of pounds on expensive camera equipment. Mr. Davies told the jury: 'A total of £59,000 was acquired using the fake. signature of his then wife. He entered each signature having not. consulted her or asked to consent.' Scroll down for video. Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. The court heard from a forensic handwriting expert, who proved Helen Bowen's signature had not been written by her - and was most likely written by her husband. Miss Bowers, a professional reflexologist, said she only discovered her husband had forged her signature a few months after their separation - when she was contacted by her mortgage provider. When asked if she agreed to the mortgage withdrawals, she replied: 'No, not at all. If I had been asked I would not have agreed to them.' Walters, now of Maesteg, in Bridgend, denies three charges of fraud. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Jaguar  was very rare. It was said that there less than 20 jaguars in the world, one of which was living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to help this jaguar, Peruvians set up a zoo for it, where there were sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. However, strange enough, no one had ever seen the jaguar hunt the deer and sheep. What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here. Tiger is the king of forest but you simply put some small animals around him. That is why the jaguar shows no interest in going out' a visitor said. So people put five wolves into the jaguar's zoo. Since then, the jaguar did not go back to its cave any more . It either stands on top of the hill yelling or runs up and down the hill without sleeping all day long . Actually, one creature without any _ is a lifeless creature. If a man lives without rivals, he is likely to be satisfied with the present and will not fight for the better. He will hold back before all difficulties . Hard environment tends to make successful people . Therefore, we need some rivals to push us to go ahead in all difficulties and competitions in our lives. Due to our rivals, we can bring out our potential to the best. Due to our rivals, we will continuously improve our abilities when competing with them! Question: What happened to the jaguar after it got five wolves around? Answer: Answer:","output":"After the introduction of five wolves into the jaguar's zoo, the jaguar experienced a significant change in its behavior. It no longer retreated to its cave and displayed lethargy as it had done before. Instead, the jaguar became more active and engaged, constantly standing on top of the hill, yelling, or running up and down the hill throughout the day without sleeping. The addition of the wolves introduced a competitive and challenging element to the jaguar's environment, which seemed to ignite its natural instincts and motivate it to be more active and lively. This also highlights the importance of having rivals or challenges in our lives to push us to improve and to maximize our potential."},{"instruction":"Q: From the given sentence, extract the phrase (often noun or verb) that carries the given relationship.

Birch town's population was affected by viral respiratory diseases, while Free town's population caught bacterial respiratory diseases.  Which town has more people that caught the flu?  Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria.

Given information: Cynthia got a much better score on their math test than Rebecca. Option 1: Cynthia didn't take the time to study for it. This option suggests that despite not studying, Cynthia performed better than Rebecca. While this is possible, it doesn't provide a reason for Cynthia's higher score compared to Rebecca.  Option 2: Rebecca didn't take the time to study for it. This option seems more plausible because it offers an explanation for the difference in their test scores. If Rebecca didn't study for the test, it would make sense that Cynthia would have a higher score since the lack of preparation can negatively impact test performance. Based on these considerations, the most logical way to end the sentence would be with option 2.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the fact that:  The more basic a solution is, the closer its pH value will be to 14.  Answer the question:   Tanya was measuring pH values and recorded a value of 13 for Solution #1. She also recorded a value of 8 for Solution #2. Which solution is less basic Solution #2 or Solution #1? A:","output":"Solution #2 is less basic than Solution #1. This statement is justified based on the understanding of the pH scale, which measures how acidic or basic a substance is.  The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pH values less than 7 denote acidity while values greater than 7 indicate basicity or alkalinity. The farther a pH value is from 7 in either direction, the stronger the acid or the base. A pH value of 14 represents the most basic or alkaline substance, whereas a pH value of 0 represents the most acidic substance.  Let's analyze the given pH values of solutions #1 and #2. Solution #1 has a pH value of 13. This is close to 14, which suggests that this solution is a strong base, or highly basic. Conversely, Solution #2 has a pH value of 8. Although this is still on the basic side of the scale (because it is above 7), it is much closer to neutral than to the maximum basic level of 14. Thus, we can derive that Solution #2, with a pH value of 8, is less basic than Solution #1, which has a pH value of 13. Although both solutions are basic (since their pH values are both above 7), the basic nature of Solution #2 is less intense compared to that of Solution #1.  It's important to understand that pH is a logarithmic scale, meaning a change by a factor of 1 actually corresponds to a tenfold difference in basicity. Consequently, even the small difference in pH between 8 and 13 results in Solution #1 being 100,000 times more basic than Solution #2. Therefore, considering the characteristics and measures of the pH scale, we can confidently conclude that Solution #2 is less basic than Solution #1, despite both being considered basic solutions in their own rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Luzzatti was born of Jewish parents in Venice on 11 March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. He was minister of agriculture in the second Sonnino Cabinet (December 2, 1909 - March 21, 1910), and on the resignation of the latter was called upon to form a cabinet himself. His administration, which lasted until March 18, 1911, was not very successful and fell over a proposed electoral reform. Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty and wide culture, he had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular. Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, as it was then constituted, he only held office at Giolitti's good pleasure.  During the First World War, he was consistently pro-Ally and strongly supported Italian intervention, but his tone was on the whole pessimistic. Although he did not take office while the war lasted, he was always consulted on all financial matters, and his sound advice was generally followed.  He became treasury minister in the second incarnation of the Nitti cabinet (March 12 - May 10, 1920), but did not resume office in the third. At the general elections of May 1921, he decided not to stand for parliament again, and was made a senator. In spite of his advanced age, he continued to write on economic and financial problems with his accustomed lucidity and soundness of judgment, insisting on the necessity for Italy to return to free trade and to reduce government interference in business matters to a minimum.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Rikers Island and the Death of Kalief Browder The Justice Department and the City of New York are expected to reach an agreement this month on a reform plan that is intended to end the barbaric abuses that have long dominated the Rikers Island jail complex. But this agreement will come too late to save Kalief Browder, who was held at the jail for three years without trial, starting in 2010, when he was 16. The psychological trauma caused by spending about two of those years in solitary confinement at Rikers remained long after his release. On Saturday, Mr. Browder committed suicide at his family’s home in the Bronx. He was 22. Mr. Browder was accused of stealing a backpack, a charge he strongly denied. Partly because his family was unable to make bail, he remained at Rikers all that time, only to have the case dismissed. The beatings he suffered at the jail were captured on video that became public in April. In one incident, Mr. Browder is brutally assaulted by a guard; in another, he is attacked and beaten by a gang of inmates. He tried to kill himself several times. According to a lawsuit filed against the city on his behalf, his condition was made immeasurably worse by guards who sometimes denied him meals, medical care and bathing privileges — and fabricated disciplinary infractions to extend his stay in isolation. Last year, the city eliminated solitary confinement for adolescents at Rikers. The court system has put in place a new plan to shorten court delays and to prevent people from being held for lengthy periods without trial. These are important changes. But a serious, legally enforceable reform plan will be needed to remake what a damning Justice Department report issued last August described as a “deep-seated culture of violence” at the jail. The report called for a thorough overhaul of Correction Department operations and also recommended that adolescents be removed from Rikers and placed in a facility elsewhere. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the State Legislature could alleviate a great deal of suffering — and bring New York into the 21st century — by passing a bill that would keep children under the age of 18 out of adult prisons. The Justice Department warned in August that the city would find itself in court if reforms were not quickly carried out. Federal prosecutors made good on that threat a few months later when they joined a pending class-action lawsuit, Nunez v. City of New York, which charges the Department of Correction with abetting violence by failing to discipline officers who participated in abuse. By joining a lawsuit that was already underway, federal prosecutors put themselves in a better position to get a court-monitored agreement that would produce enforceable, verifiable reforms. Mr. Browder’s death makes it all the more imperative that the reforms have teeth.

While he was in jail, he was treated really badly by the guards and other prisoners. After getting out of jail, the sad memories from being inside stayed with him and eventually, he decided to take his own life when he was 22. Because of his story and others like it, people are working to make big changes to how Rikers Island and other jails are run, so that people like Kalief are treated more fairly and kindly while they wait for their chance to talk to a judge."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California. \\"He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\\" Clinton said. \\"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.\\" Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. \\"It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\\" In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted. Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April. Trump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State. \\"I have a simple message for them,\\" Trump said. \\"Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. But they will be gone. And soon.\\" But... when will immigration policy change? - after Trump is elected - after Clinton is elected - not enough information - when America has spoken A:","output":"Immigration policy change is a complex issue that depends on numerous factors, such as the political climate, the elected administration's priorities, and the urgency of the matter in the nation's eyes. To provide a more detailed analysis, I'll break it down based on the mentioned scenarios. 1. After Trump is elected: If Donald Trump were to be elected as President, it is highly likely that immigration policy changes would be a prominent issue on his agenda. Trump has been vocal about his strong views on immigration, especially regarding temporary bans on Muslim immigration and building a wall along the Mexico-US border. However, it is essential to understand that any proposed changes would need to pass through Congress, which may or may not approve such changes. Opposition from within his party, as well as across the aisle, could also impact the process. Furthermore, public opinion, court decisions, and lobbying groups can all have a significant influence on the scope and speed at which immigration policy changes are implemented. 2. After Clinton is elected: If Hillary Clinton were to become President, she would likely pursue a more measured approach to immigration policy. During her campaign, she emphasized comprehensive reform that would include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and an increase in refugee quotas. Clinton's approach to fortify the borders would rely on advanced technology and increased personnel to improve efficiency. In her case as well, any immigration policy change would be subject to congressional approval, public opinion, and lobbying groups. 3. Not enough information: As seen in both cases above, predicting exact timelines for immigration policy change is challenging due to the multitude of factors involved. The changes and their implementation will depend on the political landscape after the elections, the priorities of the winning administration, and the influence of public opinion and lobbying groups. 4. When America has spoken: Regardless of when changes in the immigration policy occur, it is crucial that these changes reflect the voice of the American people and uphold the core values of the nation. This means pursuing policies that balance the need for economic growth, national security, and the preservation of human rights. Ultimately, any changes to immigration policy should be the result of meaningful dialogue and careful consideration by legislators, interest groups, and American citizens, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of all involved parties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: That would not be unusual. Here is a hypothesis: That would not be untypical. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, because both the premise and hypothesis are essentially conveying the same meaning, albeit with a slight variation in language. In this case, the main point of discussion is whether a particular occurrence or observation is unusual or untypical. To break it down further, we can examine the meanings of unusual and untypical: 1. \\"Unusual\\" means not habitually or commonly occurring or done, which implies that the object, event, or situation in question is not a common or regular occurrence. It deviates from the norm or expectation. 2. \\"Untypical\\" means not representative of a type, group, or class, indicating that the object, event, or situation does not conform to the standard characteristics or behavior patterns within a group or class. It is a deviation from the common or typical occurrences. Given these definitions, both \\"unusual\\" and \\"untypical\\" suggest that the object, event, or situation being described is outside the boundaries of common expectations, not fitting in with the norm. Now, let's examine the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: \\"That would not be unusual.\\" This premise states that the described object, event, or situation is not a rare or extraordinary occurrence. In other words, it's relatively common or normal within the context it is placed in. Hypothesis: \\"That would not be untypical.\\" This hypothesis claims that the object, event, or situation is not unique or distinct within its group, class, or type. Essentially, it is a shared characteristic or tendency within the group, class, or type. Based on the above analysis, we can infer that both the premise and the hypothesis allude to something being relatively common or typical. The premise suggests this by negating the term \\"unusual,\\" while the hypothesis negates the term \\"untypical.\\" They both express the idea that the specific object, event, or situation being described isn't fundamentally different from others in its respective group or category. Thus, if we accept the premise as true - that the object, event, or situation is not unusual - then we can conclude that the hypothesis - that it is not untypical - is also true. This is because both statements point towards the general agreement that the object, event, or situation being discussed is common or fitting within the norm or expectation of its respective group, class, or type."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\".

It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.  - The Principality of Polotsk, also known as the Kingdom of Polotsk or the Duchy of Polotsk, was a medieval principality of the Early East Slavs. The origin and date of state establishment is uncertain. The Russian chronicles mention Polotsk being conquered by Vladimir the Great, and thereafter it became associated with the Rurik dynasty and Kievan Rus'.  - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\";  , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769  5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars.

One of the most dramatic changes in priorities proposed by the City Council would shift 25.6 million from funding for court-appointed lawyers to the Legal Aid Society. In a document released yesterday to justify its reordered priorities, the Council contended that Legal Aid can achieve greater economies of scale than lawyers appointed pursuant to Article 18-B of the County Law. The Council document also noted that \\"inexplicably\\" 18-B lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal cases in New York City, even though their mandate is to handle only multi-defendant cases where the Legal Aid Society had a conflict. In past years, the City Council had consistently added 5.6 million to the 54.7 million proposed for the Legal Aid Society by former Mayor Giuliani, bringing the total to just a shade over 60 million. But this year for the first time, the Council is proposing shifting more than 20 million in funds earmarked by the Mayor for 18-B lawyers to the Legal Aid Society, which would increase its total funding to 80.4 million. That would reflect a jump in its current finding of about one-third. Meantime, the City Council proposed slashing the Mayor's allocation of 62.8 million for 18-B lawyers by 66 percent, to 21.4 million.

A show composed of a concert, circus acts, and broadway is taking place at a theater in the city. One of the stars of the show is a lady cat dancer whom Oswald suddenly has affection for upon seeing a poster. For admission, patrons have to pay 50 cents. Unfortunately for Oswald, his pockets are empty. Oswald notices a stage entrance where performers and certain officials can come in, and admission is unnecessary. Because of this, Oswald comes up with an idea of impersonating a performer by bulging his chest (possibly pretending to be a stuntman). The guard by the door isn't deceived and prevents the penniless rabbit from coming in. After a bit of a struggle, Oswald ties the guard to a lamp post and proceeds toward the inside of the theater. However, he is forced back outside by the glaring performers. While thinking of a way to get back in, Oswald sees a man in a thick fur coat coming out of a taxi and heading towards the theater entrance. Oswald hides under the man's shadow. As the man with the coat enters, the guard becomes suspicious upon noticing a lump on the shadow. Thinking he made it inside undetected, Oswald comes out but doesn't notice the guard approaching him. When he realizes the guard was right behind him, Oswald quickly makes his move. Oswald prevails in losing the guard by going inside a cage. However, he is met with more trouble when the cage contains a jaguar. The jaguar chases him into the stage where acrobats are doing a balancing act with a long pole. Oswald climbs up the pole and grabs the ceiling for his safety. One of the acrobats also goes up the pole and clings onto the rabbit's legs. Bothered by having someone hanging under him, Oswald grabs a mallet and strikes off the acrobat. Oswald plunges down and drops on the jaguar.

News article: A personal injury lawyer trying to raise money for her lawsuits against Black Lives Matter and its leaders on behalf of Baton Rouge police officers was rejected by a crowdfunding website on Sunday.      The YouCaring site is a free, online fundraising source for people around the country and in Baton Rouge, including residents whose lives were devastated by floods last year or families who have expensive medical needs. It also supports various versions of local and national Black Lives Matter campaigns.      But when lawyer Donna Grodner, who has filed two federal lawsuits on behalf of police against Black Lives Matter that target one of its leaders Deray Mckesson, created a page to raise 20,000 for expenses, YouCaring took it down.      “In alignment with our mission, we removed this fundraiser because it was not within our community guidelines around promoting harmony,” YouCaring chief marketing officer Maly Ly told the NewsHour Weekend in an email. “We are not the right platform to air grievances, or engage in contentious disputes or controversial public opinion.”      Then, Grodner created a GoFundMe page. GoFundMe did not immediately return a request for comment.      Grodner has filed two lawsuits that accuse Black Lives Matter and its leaders of causing the injuries of two police officers in separate incidents.      READ NEXT: Baton Rouge officer wounded by lone shooter sues Black Lives Matter      The first lawsuit was filed on behalf of an unnamed officer who said he was hit by debris during a protest after local police, who are white, killed 37-year-old Alton Sterling, a black man, on July 5 last year.      Following Sterling’s death, Black Lives Matter organized a “Weekend of Rage” campaign, in line with type of take-to-the-streets rallies the movement has organized since its inception around 2012, to rail against the killings of black people.      The lawsuit claims that Black Lives Matter and one of its leaders Deray Mckesson are responsible for the officer’s injuries, though Mckesson is not accused of throwing anything. It says the Black Lives Matter activists have incited violence and do not try to calm the crowds.      A judge in that case is still deciding whether Black Lives Matter can be charged as an entity.      Grodner filed a second lawsuit on Friday, but with four more leaders as defendants including Alicia Garza and Johnetta “Netta” Elzie, making a similar claim.      The officer she is representing, also unnamed, was shot several days after the Weekend of Rage, by a man from Kansas City who law enforcement said had never attended any of the protests, according to local reports.      A First Amendment lawyer told the NewsHour Weekend on Saturday that Grodner’s theory is bizarre and seems it may be an attempt to hunt for dirt within the movement rather than a legitimate legal claim. David Roland, the director of litigation at the Freedom Center of Missouri, also said it followed the same principle used in a Civil-War era law.      “It’s the same logic that gets applied to people of the Muslim faith. If there’s an act of terrorism, people say, �?If you don’t come out and disavow this personally, then you are responsible,’” he said.      Roland feared it was a shot across the bow and designed to discourage dissent.      “Black Lives Matter and the people who are involved in it are engaged in civil disobedience because they perceive a fundamental wrong in our society that needs to be corrected,” Roland said. “The best method that they know to employ … is to engage in civil disobedience, and that’s part of a long American tradition.”      Grodner’s GoFundMe page called the protesters militant, saying the money will help “hold them responsible for the injuries they caused, whether in whole or in part through its [anti]-police agenda.”      In response to questions about YouCaring’s decision and the GoFundMe page, Grodner told the NewsHour Weekend in an email that “Both are for the same purpose.”      But Ly said in her email that YouCaring was drawing a line.      “We exist to empower people and communities to rally positive financial, emotional, and social support,” she wrote. “While different viewpoints are a part of life, you should make efforts to ensure that the content of your fundraiser does not promote discord.” ||||| × Baton Rouge officer sues Black Lives Matter over 2016 ambush of cops      BATON ROUGE — A wounded officer’s lawsuit filed in federal court in Louisiana alleges Black Lives Matter and several of its leaders are responsible for last year’s ambush on law enforcement in Baton Rouge.      The July 17, 2016, attack by gunman Gavin Long claimed the lives of two police officers and a sheriff’s deputy and wounded two deputies and an officer.      Lawyers for one of the wounded law enforcement officers filed the complaint Friday in US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against various arms of the Black Lives Matter movement and leaders including DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie.      The complaint alleges Black Lives Matter and its leaders are responsible for the shooting because they “incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death (sic) of black men shot by police,” and “did nothing to dissuade the ongoing violence and injury to police.”      “In fact, they justified the violence as necessary to the movement and war,” the complaint says.      The person who filed the lawsuit is named in the complaint only as Officer John Doe Smith, but the lawsuit spells out the injuries of the officer, which are the same as Deputy Nick Tullier.      It says he is 42 with two children and is permanently disabled as a result of the numerous injuries he suffered in the ambush.      Smith, the complaint says, was shot through his abdomen, left shoulder and left side of his head. The shot to his abdomen “tore up his intestines,” requiring 16 surgeries and causing recurring infections. Medical staff must attend to the exit wound daily, it says.      The shot to Smith’s head almost tore off his left ear, which needed to be sewn back on, the complaint says. His skull was shattered and he lost brain matter on the left side, in an area controlling communication. His left eye stays mostly closed with the eyeball turned outward, it says.      “John Doe Police Officer was strong and vibrant and he has been struggling everyday, fighting to live, and fighting to get better,” the complaint says. It seeks at least 75,000 in compensatory damages.      It is not clear why the officer filed the complaint under a pseudonym.      Donna Grodner, the attorney for the officer who filed the suit, told CNN she wasn’t authorized to speak about the case.      The Baton Rouge victims      In the attack last July, Long waited for police near a Baton Rouge convenience store that was known as a favorite stop for patrol officers.      Armed with a rifle, he fatally shot Officers Matthew Gerald, 41, and Montrell Jackson, 32, outside the store as soon as he saw them.      Sheriff’s Deputy Brad Garafola, who apparently was responding to reports of a man with a rifle, heard the shots and took cover, but then ran to help one of the downed officers. That’s when Long opened fire, killing Garafola.      Long then shot Officer Chad Montgomery, who had pulled up in front of the building. The bullet grazed his head.      In a nearby parking lot, Sheriff’s Deputy Nicholas Tullier, then 41, was in his cruiser to run the tag on Long’s car when the gunman emerged from the woods and opened fire, shooting as he walked toward the vehicle.      Tullier was shot once in the head and twice in the abdomen and was in a coma for months.      Long took shots at another arriving deputy, Bruce Simmons, 51, shattering the bone from his elbow to his shoulder. Simmons now has a titanium rod in his arm.      SWAT officers then arrived on scene and shot Long in the leg, causing him to fall to the ground. As Long reached for his weapon, five SWAT officers fired, killing him.      Lawsuit: Black Lives Matter ‘declared war’ on police      The complaint describes in detail numerous protests that erupted across the country over several years, spurred by the shooting deaths of black men at the hands of police, and lists instances of violence, looting and vandalism at protests in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; McKinney, Texas; Dallas and Baton Rouge.      The suit notes Mckesson’s involvement in Black Lives Matter, and it points to his participation in the protests and his appearances in the media when he was introduced as a leader of the movement or a protest organizer.      When violence erupted at some of the protests, the complaint says, Mckesson and other Black Lives Matter leaders “failed to disavow the violence and urged its followers that violence was part of revolution,” the complaint says.      “By embracing and supporting violence in protest that could have been conducted peacefully, BLM declared a virtual war on police,” it says.      When reached for comment, Mckesson told CNN, “This is the second lawsuit an officer has filed against me from Baton Rouge. … I’m confident it has no merit.”      Elzie had no comment, and other defendants from Black Lives Matter could not be immediately reached for comment.      Baton Rouge ambush ‘mimicked’ Dallas attack      Mckesson and Elzie were present for protests in Baton Rouge in July 2016 held in response to the officer-involved shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile near Minneapolis earlier that month.      The suit says they came to protest and “to incite others to violence against police and other law enforcement officers.”      Mckesson was arrested during the protests on July 9, though he told CNN days later the arrest was unlawful because he was complying with police requests to move back at the time.      The lawsuit also says Long’s actions when he killed the Baton Rouge officers “followed and mimicked those of another BLM activist who killed several officers in Dallas just days earlier.”      Five Dallas police officers were killed and seven others wounded on July 7 last year when a gunman opened fire on them during protests against the killings of Sterling and Castile.      Investigators identified the Dallas gunman as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan.      Johnson told police negotiators during a standoff that he was upset about recent police shootings and wanted to kill white people, especially white officers, the police chief said. His online history showed he visited and liked several websites dedicated to Black Lives Matter. Johnson was killed after a standoff with police.      Long, who acted alone in the shooting, traveled to Baton Rouge after stopping in Dallas shortly after the shooting to get revenge for the recent killings, the complaint says, suggesting that Black Lives Matter encouraged the behavior. ||||| Black Lives Matter is a movement, not an organization that can be sued by a Louisiana police officer who was injured at a protest after a deadly police shooting, a prominent activist's attorney claims.      DeRay Mckesson, a Baltimore-based activist and a co-defendant in a federal lawsuit filed by a wounded Baton Rouge police officer, was one of nearly 200 protesters arrested after the July 2016 shooting death of Alton Sterling, a black man shot and killed by a white officer during a struggle outside a convenience store.      Mckesson's attorney, William Gibbens, said in a court filing that Black Lives Matter doesn't have a governing body, dues-paying members, bylaws, \\"or even a central location.\\" At best, the lawyer argued, it's a \\"community of interest.\\"      \\"However, even as a community of interest, it would be nearly impossible to ascribe a single common purpose or interest to the hundreds of thousands of different people, many with different goals and motives, who have protested, posted online, or acted under the 'Black Lives Matter' banner,\\" Gibbens wrote.      The unidentified officer claims a piece of concrete or \\"rock like substance\\" struck him in the face during a July 9 protest over Sterling's death. The officer's lawsuit says he lost teeth and received injuries to his jaw and brain.      The suit doesn't accuse Mckesson of throwing anything, but it claims he \\"incited the violence\\" on behalf of Black Lives Matter. The suit also claims Mckesson \\"was in charge of the protests\\" and he was seen and heard giving orders.      The officer's attorneys sued Mckesson individually but also served him and others with the suit as alleged \\"agents\\" of Black Lives Matter.      Donna Grodner, an attorney for the officer, is urging U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson to deny Mckesson's requests to dismiss the case. Grodner describes Black Lives Matter as a \\"thriving, if not very wealthy, unincorporated association\\" that solicits donations and sells T-shirts for profit.      \\"If Black Lives Matter does not exist, it should not be raising money or collecting millions in donations,\\" she wrote in a court filing.      Mckesson, who declined to be interviewed Wednesday, has described himself as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement.      \\"No organization started the movement,\\" he said during an interview last year.      The officer suing Mckesson is identified only as \\"Officer John Doe\\" in the suit, saying the anonymity is \\"for his protection.\\" A court filing last year cited the July 2016 sniper attack that killed five Dallas police officers and a shooting 10 days later that killed three law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge as reasons for concealing the officer's identity.      Mckesson was arrested near Baton Rouge police headquarters on a charge of obstructing a highway. East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore said his office wouldn't prosecute roughly 100 protesters who were arrested on that same charge, including Mckesson.      Mckesson and other protesters sued the city of Baton Rouge and local law enforcement officials over their arrests, accusing police of using excessive force and violating their constitutional rights. Last month, a federal judge preliminarily approved a proposed settlement of the class action. Mckesson is one of nearly 80 arrested protesters who are eligible for cash payments ranging from 500 to 1,000 if the settlement gets the court's final approval.      Mckesson and Black Lives Matter also were named as defendants in a federal lawsuit that Larry Klayman — founder of the conservative group Freedom Watch — filed last year in Texas after the sniper attack on Dallas police officers. Klayman also sued former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other political figures, accusing the defendants of inciting a \\"race war\\" against police officers.      Mckesson's lawyers argued Klayman should have known his claims were frivolous. A judge's ruling on June 2 said the plaintiffs didn't provide the court with any support for their \\"proposition\\" that Black Lives Matter is an entity capable of being sued. All of Klayman's claims against Mckesson and Black Lives Matter have been dismissed or withdrawn.      Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The July 17, 2016, attack by gunman Gavin Long claimed the lives of two police officers and a sheriff's deputy and wounded two deputies and an officer.      Lawyers for one of the wounded law enforcement officers filed the complaint Friday in US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against various arms of the Black Lives Matter movement and leaders including DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie.      The complaint alleges Black Lives Matter and its leaders are responsible for the shooting because they \\"incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death (sic) of black men shot by police,\\" and \\"did nothing to dissuade the ongoing violence and injury to police.\\"      \\"In fact, they justified the violence as necessary to the movement and war,\\" the complaint says.      The person who filed the lawsuit is named in the complaint only as Officer John Doe Smith. It says he is 42 with two children and is permanently disabled as a result of the numerous injuries he suffered in the ambush.      Smith, the complaint says, was shot through his abdomen, left shoulder and left side of his head. The shot to his abdomen \\"tore up his intestines,\\" requiring 16 surgeries and causing recurring infections. Medical staff must attend to the exit wound daily, it says.      The shot to Smith's head almost tore off his left ear, which needed to be sewn back on, the complaint says. His skull was shattered and he lost brain matter on the left side, in an area controlling communication. His left eye stays mostly closed with the eyeball turned outward, it says.      \\"John Doe Police Officer was strong and vibrant and he has been struggling everyday, fighting to live, and fighting to get better,\\" the complaint says. It seeks at least 75,000 in compensatory damages.      It is not clear why the officer filed the complaint under a pseudonym.      Donna Grodner, the attorney for the officer who filed the suit, told CNN she wasn't authorized to speak about the case.      The Baton Rouge victims      In the attack last July , Long waited for police near a Baton Rouge convenience store that was known as a favorite stop for patrol officers.      Armed with a rifle, he fatally shot Officers Matthew Gerald, 41, and Montrell Jackson, 32, outside the store as soon as he saw them.      Sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola, who apparently was responding to reports of a man with a rifle, heard the shots and took cover, but then ran to help one of the downed officers. That's when Long opened fire, killing Garafola.      Long then shot Officer Chad Montgomery, who had pulled up in front of the building. The bullet grazed his head.      In a nearby parking lot, Sheriff's Deputy Nicholas Tullier, then 41, was in his cruiser to run the tag on Long's car when the gunman emerged from the woods and opened fire, shooting as he walked toward the vehicle.      Tullier was shot once in the head and twice in the abdomen and was in a coma for months.      Long took shots at another arriving deputy, Bruce Simmons, 51, shattering the bone from his elbow to his shoulder. Simmons now has a titanium rod in his arm.      SWAT officers then arrived on scene and shot Long in the leg, causing him to fall to the ground. As Long reached for his weapon, five SWAT officers fired, killing him.      Lawsuit: Black Lives Matter 'declared war' on police      The complaint describes in detail numerous protests that erupted across the country over several years, spurred by the shooting deaths of black men at the hands of police, and lists instances of violence, looting and vandalism at protests in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore; McKinney, Texas; Dallas and Baton Rouge.      The suit notes Mckesson's involvement in Black Lives Matter, and it points to his participation in the protests and his appearances in the media when he was introduced as a leader of the movement or a protest organizer.      When violence erupted at some of the protests, the complaint says, Mckesson and other Black Lives Matter leaders \\"failed to disavow the violence and urged its followers that violence was part of revolution,\\" the complaint says.      \\"By embracing and supporting violence in protest that could have been conducted peacefully, BLM declared a virtual war on police,\\" it says.      When reached for comment, Mckesson told CNN, \\"This is the second lawsuit an officer has filed against me from Baton Rouge. ... I'm confident it has no merit.\\"      Elzie had no comment, and other defendants from Black Lives Matter could not be immediately reached for comment.      Baton Rouge ambush 'mimicked' Dallas attack      Mckesson and Elzie were present for protests in Baton Rouge in July 2016 held in response to the officer-involved shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile near Minneapolis earlier that month.      The suit says they came to protest and \\"to incite others to violence against police and other law enforcement officers.\\"      Mckesson was arrested during the protests on July 9, though he told CNN days later the arrest was unlawful because he was complying with police requests to move back at the time.      The lawsuit also says Long's actions when he killed the Baton Rouge officers \\"followed and mimicked those of another BLM activist who killed several officers in Dallas just days earlier.\\"      Five Dallas police officers were killed and seven others wounded on July 7 last year when a gunman opened fire on them during protests against the killings of Sterling and Castile.      Investigators identified the Dallas gunman as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, a military veteran who had served in Afghanistan.      Johnson told police negotiators during a standoff that he was upset about recent police shootings and wanted to kill white people, especially white officers, the police chief said. His online history showed he visited and liked several websites dedicated to Black Lives Matter. Johnson was killed after a standoff with police.      Long, who acted alone in the shooting, traveled to Baton Rouge after stopping in Dallas shortly after the shooting to get revenge for the recent killings, the complaint says, suggesting that Black Lives Matter encouraged the behavior. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A lawyer called Donna Grodner is trying to help some police officers who got hurt.

Given the background: Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.  and the situation: David was visiting Europe last summer. First he visited London. To his dismay, it was overcast all night. Then he flew to Rome. There the sky was as clear as you could get at night. David was very happy about it.  Answer the following question: In Rome, would less or more infrared radiaton be emitted at night than in London? Answer:","output":"In Rome, less infrared radiation would be emitted at night than in London. Step 1: Consider the given background information. The background tells us that the atmosphere emits infrared radiation due to its temperature. Clouds, which are made of water vapor (H2O), strongly absorb and emit infrared radiation. This means that on clear nights, Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights due to lower amounts of infrared radiation being emitted by the atmosphere. Step 2: Apply the background information to the specific situation. David visited London, where it was overcast all night. This means that there were clouds in the sky, which would result in a higher amount of infrared radiation being emitted due to their strong absorption and emission properties. Then, David went to Rome where the sky was clear at night. With no clouds to absorb and emit infrared radiation, the amount of infrared radiation emitted in Rome would be lesser than in London. Conclusion: In Rome, there would be less infrared radiation emitted at night compared to London due to the clear sky conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, we will use vegetables or cheese to create a base for our pizza. Here's a simple way to make a grain-free pizza: 1. Choose a base: You can use vegetables like cauliflower, zucchini, or even cheese like mozzarella to make the crust. Cauliflower is a popular choice for many people. 2. Prepare the base: - If using cauliflower, cut it into little pieces and blend it in a food processor. Cook it in the microwave for a few minutes to soften it. Then, squeeze out water with a towel. Mix it with some cheese and egg so it can stick together. - If using zucchini, grate it and do the same as with cauliflower. - If using cheese, just mix it with egg and any other seasoning you like. 3. Shape the crust: Place your mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Press it down and shape it into a flat circle, just like a regular pizza crust. 4. Bake the crust: Put it in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 15-20 minutes, or until it turns golden-brown. 5. Add toppings: Now it's time for the fun part! Use your favorite pizza sauce and spread it on the crust. Then, add cheese and any other toppings you love, like, tomatoes, mushrooms, or bell peppers—just like you're decorating a picture! 6. Bake the pizza: Put your masterpiece back in the oven for about 7-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. 7. Cool and enjoy: Let your grain-free pizza cool down a little, then slice it and enjoy your creation! Remember, this is a simple version, and there are many more recipes to explore.

He died in the early hours of the morning on 21 September 1558, at the age of 58, holding in his hand the cross that his wife Isabella had been holding when she died.  Charles was originally buried in the chapel of the Monastery of Yuste, but he left a codicil in his last will and testament asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he would be reburied with Isabella. Following his return to Spain in 1559, their son Philip undertook the task of fulfilling his father's wish when he founded the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. After the Monastery's Royal Crypt was completed in 1574, the bodies of Charles and Isabella were relocated and re-interred into a small vault directly underneath the altar of the famous Basilica of the Monastery, in accordance with Charles's wishes to be buried \\"half-body under the altar and half-body under the priest's feet\\" side by side with Isabella. They remained in this vault until 1654 when they were later moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings by their great-grandson Philip IV, who, in doing so, disrespected his great-grandfather's wishes.

Q:Question: \\"What caused Edison's Amberol cylinder to fail?\\"  Context: \\"In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Several factors contributed to Edison's Amberol cylinder failing in the market.  1. The first factor is the superior duration of disc records. In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced that could play for more than three minutes, and in 1903, 12-inch records were introduced that could play for more than four minutes. In contrast, contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. Even though Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, which had a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes, this was not sufficient to overcome the advantage of discs. 2. The second factor is the material of the cylinders. The original Amberol cylinders were made of celluloid, a plastic which was far less fragile than the materials previously used. However, this likely did not provide a notable advantage over disc records. 3. Finally, patent regulations also played a part in the failure of Amberol cylinder. By 1919, the basic patents for the manufacture of laterally-cut disc records had expired, which enabled countless companies to produce them. With competition increasing, the market for the Amberol cylinders dwindled. Despite Edison's attempts to innovate and improve his product, the advantage of disc records in terms of duration and the increased competition from other companies resulted in Edison's Amberol cylinder failing in the market. Edison continued to produce Blue Amberol cylinders until late 1929, but the product never got the desired market success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries.

He was the first leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a Christian Democratic party that under his leadership became, and has since usually been the most influential party in the country.  - The Social Market Economy (SOME) (also called Rhine capitalism) is a socioeconomic model combining a free market capitalist economic system alongside social policies which establish both fair competition within the market and a welfare state. It is sometimes classified as a coordinated market economy. The social market economy was originally promoted and implemented in West Germany by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1949. Its origins can be traced to the interwar Freiburg school of economic thought.  - A minister-president or minister president is the head of government in any of a number of European countries or subnational governments, in which a parliamentary or semi-presidential system of government prevails, who presides over the council of ministers. It is an alternative term for prime minister, premier, chief minister or first minister, and very similar to the title of President of the Council.  - A chief minister is the elected head of government of a sub-national (e.g., constituent federal) entity. Examples include: Provinces Governor of Federal states in Nepal; a state (and sometimes a union territory) in India; a territory of Australia; provinces of Sri Lanka or Pakistan; Philippine autonomous regions; or a British Overseas Territory that has attained self-governance. It is also used as the English version of the title given to the heads of governments of the Malay states without a monarchy.  - Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg.  - Lübeck is a city in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, and one of the major ports of Germany. On the river Trave, it was the leading city of the Hanseatic League, and because of its extensive Brick Gothic architecture is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. In 2015, it had a population of 218,523.  - Kurt Georg Kiesinger (6 April 1904  9 March 1988) was a German politician who served as Chancellor of West Germany from 1 December 1966 to 21 October 1969. Before he became Chancellor he served as Minister President of Baden-Württemberg from 1958 to 1966 and as President of the Federal Council from 1962 to 1963. He was Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union from 1967 to 1971.  - Helmut Josef Michael Kohl (born 3 April 1930) is a German statesman, who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1982 to 1998 (of West Germany 198290 and of the reunited Germany 199098) and as the chairman of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 1973 to 1998. From 1969 to 1976, Kohl was the 3rd Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - A presidential system is a system of government where a head of government is also head of state and leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. The United States, for instance, has a presidential system. The executive is elected and often titled \\"president\\" and is not responsible to the legislature and which cannot, in normal circumstances, dismiss it. The legislature may have the right, in extreme cases, to dismiss the executive, often through impeachment. However, such dismissals are seen as so rare as not to contradict a central tenet of presidentialism, that in \\"normal circumstances using normal means\\" the legislature cannot dismiss the executive.  - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic.  - Flensburg (Low Saxon: \\"Flensborg\\", North Frisian: \\"Flansborj\\", South Jutlandic: \\"Flensborre\\") is an independent town (\\"kreisfreie Stadt\\") in the north of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Flensburg is the centre of the region of Southern Schleswig. After Kiel and Lübeck it is the third largest town in Schleswig-Holstein.  - Germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states (plural \\"Länder\\"; informally also \\"Bundesland\\", plural \\"Bundesländer\\"). Since today's Germany was formed from an earlier collection of several states, it has a federal constitution, and the constituent states retain a measure of sovereignty. With an emphasis on geographical conditions, Berlin and Hamburg are frequently called ' (city-states), as is the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, which in fact includes the cities of and . The remaining 13 states are called ' (literally: area states).  - Ludwig Wilhelm Erhard (4 February 1897  5 May 1977) was a German politician affiliated with the CDU and the second Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) from 1963 until 1966. He is often famed for leading German postwar economic reforms and economic recovery (\\"\\"Wirtschaftswunder,\\"\\" German for \\"economic miracle\\") in his role as Minister of Economics under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer from 1949 to 1963. During that period he promoted the concept of the social market economy (\\"soziale Marktwirtschaft\\"), on which Germany's economic policy in the 21st century continues to be based. In his tenure as chancellor, however, Erhard failed to win confidence in his handling of a budget deficit and his direction of foreign policy, and his popularity waned. He resigned his chancellorship on 1 December 1966.

Everything that happened after that does n't matter now . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What may happen after Kazakhstan received my document ?","output":"After Kazakhstan received your documents, there are several events that may have occurred based on the details provided in the passage.  1. Document Processing: It appears that the IREX staff in Kazakhstan were responsible for handling your documents. After receiving them, they would have probably reviewed your paperwork for correctness and completeness to ensure they met all requirements and guidelines. 2. Document Submission: Once IREX staff had gone through your documents, they needed to be sent to Washington, D.C., as mentioned in the passage. The staff would have to ensure your documents reached their destination on time and were submitted to the appropriate authorities or organization in Washington, D.C. The tight deadline of just an hour suggests that the staff may have used an expedited mode of communication, such as a secure electronic transmission or express courier service, to meet the deadline. 3. Evaluation and Decision-making: After the documents were submitted to Washington, D.C., the relevant organization or authorities would have reviewed and evaluated your paperwork. This process would involve assessing the content of your documents, checking your eligibility and qualifications, and determining whether you met the necessary criteria for the program or opportunity you were applying for. 4. Notification of Results: Following the evaluation of your documents, you might have been informed about the results and decisions taken related to your application. This could include receiving an acceptance or rejection letter, an invitation to an interview, requests for additional information or documents, or any other steps that would be necessary to move forward. 5.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the massacre about which Weinberg writes a more likely explanation is that it \\"should be seen as looking forward to a future in which there might again be a Poland on the Soviet Union's western border\\"? from the following article ?  Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus. The reason for the massacre, according to the historian Gerhard Weinberg, was that Stalin wanted to deprive a potential future Polish military of a large portion of its... A:","output":"The name of the massacre about which Weinberg writes a more likely explanation is that it \\"should be seen as looking forward to a future in which there might again be a Poland on the Soviet Union's western border\\" is the Katyn Massacre. The Katyn Massacre refers to the mass execution of Polish officers, intellectuals, and other members of the Polish elite by the Soviet Union's secret police, the NKVD, in 1940. This event took place during World War II when the Soviet Union had occupied the eastern part of Poland following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany. The massacre's primary aim was to eliminate a significant portion of the Polish leadership and intelligentsia, thereby weakening any future Polish resistance and securing the Soviet Union's control over the region. Over 22,000 Polish victims were killed in the massacre, which was carried out in several locations, including the Katyn Forest, as well as the prisons and camps of Starobelsk, Kozelsk, and Ostashkov, among others. The victims included military officers, police officers, prison officers, gendarmes, priests, landowners, and members of the legal profession. The Soviet Union initially denied responsibility for the massacre, blaming the Nazis for the killings. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian government officially acknowledged the Soviet Union's responsibility for the Katyn Massacre and released classified documents related to the event. Gerhard Weinberg's explanation points to the strategic intention of the Soviet Union to weaken a potential future Polish military by eliminating a large portion of its leadership. This perspective suggests that the massacre was a preemptive measure taken by the Soviets to prevent the resurgence of a strong and independent Poland on its western border in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Inc. says it will phase out the sale of products and plants that contain pesticides linked to deaths of honey bees and other pollinators, becoming what is believed to be the largest retailer to take such a move.      The company’s announcement comes days after the release of a study by the European Academies Science Advisory Council that said the agricultural use of neonicotinoid pesticides is harmful to a range of helpful insects and organisms, not just honeybees.      The paper joins a long list of studies critical of the pesticides currently banned in Europe but widely used in North America.      Agricultural groups and the chemical companies that make the pesticides say they are safe and effective protection against harmful insects if used properly, and that honeybee populations are thriving. But some beekeepers and scientists say the chemicals are killing bees and other insects by compounding the effects of virus-bearing mites and other threats.      North Carolina-based Lowe’s said the studies on neonicotinoids are inconclusive, and it was taking the steps “out of an abundance of caution.”      In its 2014 Report on Social Responsibility released on Thursday, the company said it will work with the growers of its plants to eliminate the use of neonics and phase out within two years sales of lawn and garden pesticides that contain neonics.      “Our direction regarding neonics doesn’t imply that there is anything wrong or unsafe with our current products,” said Karen Cobb, a spokeswoman for the store that has 1,840 outlets in North America. “Products available at Lowe’s are U.S. EPA-approved to be safe and effective when used according to manufacturer’s directions.”      Ontario last month said it planned to have rules in place by this summer that would reduce by 80 per cent the use of neonics on corn and soybean by 2017. The regulations would restrict the prophylactic use of seed treatments in an effort to ensure they are used only in areas prone to crop-destroying insects.      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said last week it will no longer approve new uses for neonics pending further study of the effects on bees and other pollinators.      Environmental group Friends of the Earth last year released a study that showed 51 per cent of the plants and flowers sold at major garden stores in Canada and the United States contained neonics. “All of those plants were labelled ‘bee friendly,’ but were treated without any warning to consumers,” said Tiffany Finck-Haynes of Friends of the Earth.      Home Depot has said it would begin labelling plants that contained or were grown using the pesticides. “We offer our customers the ability to choose from a variety of lawn and garden products and currently carry over 40 environmentally preferred alternatives. In addition we are actively working with our live goods suppliers to find alternative insecticides for protecting live goods and bees,” Home Depot said in an e-mail on Thursday.      “What makes Lowe’s unique is they are the largest retailer [to] make a time-bound commitment, whereas Home Depot said they are labelling their plants and working with their suppliers to find safer alternatives, [but] they haven’t made any time-bound public commitments on how they are actually phasing out neonics on their plants and on their off-the-shelf products,” Ms. Finck-Haynes said by phone.      Bayer, which makes neonic-based pesticides used by farmers and gardeners, did not respond to an interview request. ||||| CHICAGO Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc will stop selling a type of pesticide suspected of causing a decline in honeybee populations needed to pollinate key American crops, following a few U.S. retailers who have taken similar steps last year.      The class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, or neonics, are sold by agrichemical companies to boost yields of staple crops but are also used widely on annual and perennial plants used in lawns and gardens.      Scientists, consumer groups, beekeepers and others say bee deaths are linked to the neonic pesticides. The bee die-off is worrisome for agriculture because honeybees pollinate plants that produce about a fourth of the food consumed by Americans.      Lowe's said it will phase out neonics in shelf products and plants by the spring of 2019, as suitable alternatives become available.      A study released by environment group Friends of the Earth and Pesticide Research Institute in 2014 showed that 51 percent of garden plants purchased at Lowe's, Home Depot and Walmart in 18 cities in the United States and Canada contained neonicotinoid pesticides at levels that could harm or even kill bees.      In 2014, the White House announced a plan to fund new honeybee habitats and to form a task force to study how to reverse the honeybee declines.      Last year, BJ's Wholesale Club, a warehouse retailer said it was asking all of its vendors to provide plants free of neonics by the end of 2014 or to label such products.      Home Depot, the largest U.S. home improvement chain, also asked its suppliers to start labeling any plants treated with neonics and that it was running tests in several states to see if suppliers can eliminate neonics in their plant production without hurting plant health.

While it's unclear when the iOS app will be launching, the company said in a tweet it would be \\"coming soon.\\" The company began testing a beta version of the app in New Zealand earlier this year, and later expanded the preview to Australia, Austria and Canada. We don't know when the app may be more broadly available or if the company has plans to release a beta in the United States ahead of its official launch. It's true. Firefox for iOS is coming soon! https://t.co/fPCFVasxAt pic.twitter.com/J1kxL6msLv — Firefox (@firefox) November 2, 2015 A Mozilla spokesperson declined to provide further details around the timing of the app's launch. The early version includes an intelligent search feature, which surfaces recommended search results. (Mozilla ditched Google and made Yahoo its default search engine last year, though users can still opt to use Google, Bing or another search engine.) The broswer also has a \\"visual tabs\\" system that displays your open tabs in a grid to make it easier top see what pages you currently have open. The app lets you sync tabs, search history and passwords between desktop and mobile apps.

Movie title: Make It Happen Movie plot: The movie opens in Glenwood, Indiana, where Lauryn Kirk (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) narrates the first few parts. There are no dance schools in Glenwood and Lauryn says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance. The next night, Brenda finds herself short of dancers. Russ asks Lauryn to dance, after having seen her graceful performance the previous night. Lauryn reluctantly agrees, and goes on stage. At first, new to the sexy routine, Lauryn looks foolish, but when Russ starts playing hip-hop music, Lauryn does a sexy hip-hop routine, and finds herself to be Ruby's new star. As Lauryn and Russ' relationship progresses, Lauryn continues performing stunningly on stage, much to Carmen's chagrin. One night...

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The salt water is heated - As the saltwater is heated the water becomes a gas - The salt particles sink to the bottom of the container - Gaseous water is piped into another container - Allowed to cool - The salt particles are left behind in the first container - The second container contains fresh water.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more pressure on rocks happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process you've described is a simple method of desalination, which involves heating saltwater to produce water vapor and then condensing the vapor in a separate container to obtain fresh water, leaving the salt behind. The perturbation hypothesis you've mentioned involves applying more pressure on rocks, and we will examine whether this affects the desalination process. A: From the given desalination process, there seems to be no direct effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the salt removal. The process of desalination relies on differences in temperature (heating and cooling) to separate the salt from the water. Applying more pressure on rocks will not have any immediate or observable direct effect on the rate of salt removal through this specific desalination method. However, if we consider the impact of increased pressure on rocks in a larger geological context, there may be an indirect effect. Increased pressure on rocks can lead to tectonic movements, which could, in turn, lead to changes in the distribution and concentration of salt in underground and surface waters. For instance, geological uplifts and shifts might expose new sources of salt deposits, potentially increasing the salinity of the surrounding water. In such a case, the increased salinity would require more energy and time for the desalination process to separate salt from water effectively. Under these circumstances, the efficiency of the simple desalination process would be indirectly affected by the perturbation. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis of increased pressure on rocks doesn't directly affect the desalination process, it can potentially have an indirect effect by altering the salinity of water through geological changes. This would, in turn, require more energy and time to remove the salt from the water using the described process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Against yen, it slipped to 103.66, the lowest level since April 1. Market analysts contemplate the possibility of dollar-euro exchange rate reaching 1.35 and 100 yen within months.","output":"This is about the recent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against two major global currencies, the euro and the Japanese yen. The event outlines a significant milestone, as the dollar has reached its lowest exchange rate against the euro and the yen since specific dates mentioned in the description. This currency fluctuation could impact various aspects of the global economy, and market analysts are exploring the potential future scenarios for the dollar-euro and the dollar-yen exchange rates. The U.S. dollar has experienced a notable depreciation, reaching an all-time low of 1.3068 per euro on Wednesday. This exchange rate signifies that one would now require a larger amount of U.S. dollars to buy a single euro compared to past rates. This depreciation of the dollar against the euro can affect international trade, investments, and other economic activities involving these currencies. Exporters and importers, for example, would have to reconsider their growth strategies and pricing in response to the changed exchange rate, as the cost of goods and services would effectively change for each currency zone. In a similar vein, the U.S. dollar has depreciated against the Japanese yen to reach a rate of 103.66, marking the lowest level since April 1. Again, this development changes the dynamics of economic and financial activities between the United States and Japan. Both countries are prominent economic players, and such fluctuations in currency values can influence various industries, companies, and individual financial decisions. Market analysts are now assessing the potential implications of these recent declines, contemplating the possibility of the dollar-euro exchange rate reaching 1.35 per euro and the dollar-yen rate falling to 100 yen within the span of a few months. Based on economic indicators, global events, and market sentiments, analysts develop projections for future exchange rates. These projections are far from certain, but they offer valuable insights that help investors, policymakers, and businesses in making informed decisions. If the dollar continues to depreciate at these rates, it could have various consequences for the economies involved. A weaker U.S. dollar can make exports from the United States more competitive, potentially boosting American businesses and contributing to domestic economic growth. Conversely, imports would become more expensive, leading consumers and businesses to reconsider their purchasing decisions. This currency trend may also have a negative impact on the purchasing power of American travelers visiting Europe or Japan and vice versa, as their respective currencies' values would have changed. Another possible outcome of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar is its effect on investment decisions. Investors might reevaluate their portfolios, moving away from dollar-denominated assets to seek opportunities in other currencies or asset classes. Moreover, central banks and governments in Europe, Japan, and the United States may have to reevaluate their monetary policies to manage these exchange rate fluctuations and address potential economic risks. In conclusion, the recent all-time low of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the yen has generated market concerns and economic implications across the globe. Market analysts are closely observing trends and speculating potential future scenarios, such as the dollar-euro exchange rate reaching 1.35 and the dollar-yen rate touching 100 yen within months. This situation may continue to have a significant impact on international trade, investments, and policymaking, as businesses, governments, and consumers adapt to the changing currency landscape."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How can you get permanent marker stains off your body?","output":"To get permanent marker stains off your body, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Test the affected area: Before attempting any removal methods, make sure your skin is not sensitive or allergic to any of the products you plan to use. Test a small, inconspicuous area of your skin first to ensure it does not cause irritation or redness. 2. Soap and water: Start with the most basic and gentle method. Wet the affected area with water and apply a mild soap, like hand soap or dish soap. Rub it gently on the stain and rinse with water. Sometimes, this can be enough to remove the marker if the stain is fairly new. 3. Alcohol or acetone: If soap and water doesn't work, you can try using rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, or nail polish remover containing acetone. Apply a small amount of the product on a cotton ball or soft cloth and gently rub the stain in a circular motion. The alcohol or acetone will help dissolve the marker ink, making it easier to remove. 4. Baby oil or oil-based makeup remover: Another option is to use baby oil or an oil-based makeup remover. Apply a small amount to a cotton ball or soft cloth and gently rub the stain. The oil can help break down the ink, allowing it to be removed more easily. 5. Baking soda and water: You can also create a paste by mixing baking soda with a small amount of water. Apply the paste onto the stained area and rub it gently with a soft cloth or your fingers. The abrasive nature of the baking soda can help lift the ink from the skin, but be cautious not to irritate your skin. 6. Keep the area moisturized: Regardless of the method you choose, it's important to keep the affected area moisturized, as some of these methods can be drying to the skin. Apply a gentle moisturizer or lotion after each attempt to remove the stain. 7. Time and patience: If the stain is stubborn and not completely removed with the above methods, remember that with time and the natural process of skin cell turnover, the permanent marker will eventually fade away on its own. Remember to be gentle with your skin throughout the removal process and discontinue using a method if you experience irritation or discomfort."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write the above sentence using proper case.","output":"Now, we will explain how 5-HTP can reduce your appetite. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a naturally occurring amino acid and a chemical precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin plays a significant role in regulating mood, anxiety, and appetite, among other things, in the human body. By increasing the levels of serotonin, 5-HTP can directly impact appetite reduction and weight management. The process begins with the conversion of tryptophan, an essential amino acid found in protein-rich foods, into 5-HTP. Once produced, 5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted into serotonin in the brain. It is worth noting that unlike 5-HTP, serotonin itself cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, which is why taking 5-HTP supplements can be more effective in increasing serotonin levels within the brain. The mechanism by which 5-HTP reduces appetite can be explained through the role serotonin plays in controlling hunger and satiety. Serotonin acts on specific receptors within the hypothalamus, a region of the brain responsible for controlling appetite, body temperature, and other homeostatic processes. These specific receptors, known as 5-HT2C receptors, are the primary target for appetite modulation. When serotonin binds to these receptors, it helps promote a sense of fullness and satiety, ultimately leading to a decrease in overall food intake and a reduction in appetite. Moreover, increased levels of serotonin have been associated with improved mood and reduced anxiety, which can also contribute to a decrease in emotional eating and cravings for unhealthy foods. This is particularly important for individuals who tend to overeat in response to stress or negative emotions. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of 5-HTP supplementation on appetite and weight loss. Results consistently show that individuals who take 5-HTP experience a greater reduction in appetite and subsequent weight loss when compared to those who take a placebo. Research also suggests that the weight loss effects of 5-HTP are more pronounced in overweight or obese individuals. It is important to note that while 5-HTP may be beneficial in reducing appetite, it should not be considered a standalone solution for weight management. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and a healthy lifestyle are still essential components in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Furthermore, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially for individuals currently taking medications or those with existing health conditions. In conclusion, 5-HTP has the potential to reduce appetite by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which in turn influences feelings of satiety and fullness. This can help individuals control their food intake and ultimately support weight management efforts. However, it is important to emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to weight loss, including a healthy diet and regular physical activity, to achieve long-term success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, KCB (5 March 1879 - 16 March 1963) was a British economist who was a noted progressive and social reformer. He is best known for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the social services and wrote about the subject for the Morning Post newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London. There he worked closely with Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting old age pensions, free school meals, and campaigning for a national system of labour exchanges.  In 1908, now considered to be the United Kingdom's leading authority on unemployment insurance, he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to Winston Churchill, who had recently been promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and National Insurance to combat unemployment and poverty. During the First World War he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the Ministry of Food.  In 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on social policy. He was so highly influenced by the Fabian Society socialists - in particular by Beatrice Webb, with whom he worked on the 1909 Poor Laws report - that he could readily be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909) and a large historical study of prices and wages (1939). The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with Edwin Cannan and Lionel Robbins, who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots.  In 1933 he helped set up the Academic Assistance Council. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape Nazi persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed Master of University College, Oxford. What did he work on at the London School of Economics and Political Science?","output":"When William Beveridge was at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), he worked on several social and economic policies. He published academic works on unemployment and a big study on prices and wages. He was also involved in commissions and committees for social policy. As a director of the LSE, he helped set the direction of the school, sometimes having debates with other people who wanted to change its focus. In simpler words, at LSE, he worked on understanding how to help people with no jobs and studied how much things cost and how much people were paid. He also helped make important decisions for the school and worked with others to improve society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

Do not sell your item to a buyer if you suspect that it is over the item you are selling's worth.","output":"In order to stay safe and protect yourself from online scams, it is crucial to vet potential buyers thoroughly and establish solid lines of communication. When interacting with prospective customers, make sure to ask specific questions about their interest in the purchase and ensure their responses align with the product or service being offered. Additionally, stick to using reputable payment channels, such as PayPal or well-known bank platforms, guaranteeing a secure and protected transaction. Keep track of any transaction-related documentation, including invoices, shipping receipts, and tracking information to minimize the risk of disputes and scams from occurring. Another effective method to prevent fraudulent activities is to familiarize yourself with the warning signs and red flags that are commonly associated with online scams. These can include unusual buyer requests (such as requests for shipping to a non-existent address or overseas location which was not listed in your shipping agreement), last-minute changes to the agreed-upon terms, or a request for upfront payment to expedite the shipping process. Additionally, beware of buyers who try to communicate directly outside of the established platform (e.g., direct email or text messages) without your consent, as it may be an attempt to bypass the platform's security measures and engage in fraudulent activities. It's also a good practice to educate yourself on the policies and security measures implemented by the online marketplace in which you are operating. Ensure that you adhere to their guidelines, as this can offer you added security and protection in the event of a dispute or potential scam. Furthermore, if you do suspect a buyer is attempting to defraud you, report them to the online marketplace immediately, so they can take necessary actions to investigate and mitigate any fraudulent activities. In conclusion, prevention is key when it comes to safeguarding yourself against online scams when selling products or services across various platforms. By engaging in critical thinking, staying informed, practicing vigilance, and following the guidelines presented above, you can greatly reduce your risk of falling prey to online scammers.

The girl tried to hit the ball with the bat but the","output":"ball soared way too high, making it impossible for her to reach. She watched, disappointed, as the ball flew far above her head and towards the thick trees on the edge of the field. Not wanting to give up just yet, she decided to run after the ball, hoping she could still retrieve it before it was lost forever. Step 1: Decide to run after the ball Justification: The girl is determined and doesn't want to give up on the game. Step 2: Start sprinting towards the trees Justification: The girl needs to reach the ball quickly before it gets lost in the trees, so sprinting will allow her to cover the distance faster. As she sprinted towards the trees, her eyes scanned the sky, watching as the ball continued its flight amongst the branches. She was worried she would lose sight of it among the dense foliage, so she picked up her pace, her heart pounding with anticipation. Step 3: Pick up the pace to have a better chance to see where the ball will land Justification: The girl understands that if she loses sight of the ball, her chances of finding it decrease significantly, so she increases her speed to reduce the possibility of that happening. Just as she reached the edge of the forest, the ball disappeared into the leafy canopy. The girl stopped in her tracks, trying to guess where it might have landed, based on its trajectory. Realizing it was futile, she stepped carefully into the woodland, ears perked for the sound of the ball rustling in the bushes or leaves. Step 4: Stop and analyze the situation upon entering the forest Justification: The girl needs to make a plan to search for the ball, taking into consideration its possible location and using her senses to help find it. Step 5: Move carefully into the woodland, listening for any sounds Justification: By moving carefully and quietly, the girl increases her chances of hearing any sounds that could indicate the ball's location. After a few minutes of searching, the girl spotted a glint of the ball's shiny surface, partially hidden behind a bush. She let out a sigh of relief and reached down to pick it up, brushing off the dirt and leaves that had stuck to its surface. Step 6: Spot the ball and retrieve it Justification: Successfully finding the ball allows the girl to continue with the game. With the ball in her grasp, the girl looked back at the field, took a deep breath, and retraced her steps back to where her friends eagerly awaited her return. She felt a sense of accomplishment, having faced the challenge head-on and emerged victorious. As she re-joined the game, she approached the plate with newfound determination, promising herself that this time, she would hit the ball with precision and skill. Step 7: Return to the game with newfound determination Justification: The girl's experience of finding the ball taught her that she can face challenges successfully, reinforcing her determination to do better at the game."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: -  Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere - The make-up of the atmosphere changes - Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere - The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy - Human beings cut down trees - Human beings do not re-plant the trees - Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth&#x27;s short term weather - Eventually the long-term climate patterns start to change -   What might be the first step of the process?

With shocking comments targeting party leadership, advocating for unconventional marriage, and even a bizarre confession, the ex-chairman's words have fueled heated discussions and impacted the legislation. Body:  1. Unleashing Frustration on Party Leadership In a foul-mouthed attack, the former Tory chairman criticized the party's leadership, warning that disaffected Conservatives will be drawn to UKIP as a result. The sharp criticism on the way the party is being managed creates an atmosphere of tension and reveals underlying issues that could affect the party's unity moving forward.  2. Family Marriage and Inheritance Tax  A controversial proposition by the ex-chairman is to allow family members to marry in order to avoid inheritance tax. This suggestion, though unconventional, highlights the chairman's apparent concerns about the current taxation system and its impact on families. As the debate on inheritance tax intensifies, unexpected proposals such as this may create further rifts within political circles. 3. Confession in The Big Issue Interview Adding fuel to the controversy, the former Tory chairman declared in a Big Issue interview, \\"I quite fancy my brother!\\" While the comment may be seen as provocative or light-hearted, it has certainly drawn public attention and raised questions about the true intent behind the statement. 4.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Martin Brodeur was born on May 6, 1972, in Montreal. He was one of five children of Denis and Mireille Brodeur. Denis played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal. After his playing career, Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens. After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the 1995-96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals.  In the 1996-97 season, the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, was named to the All-Star team, and had the lowest goals against average by a goalie in almost 30 years, earning him the Jennings Trophy. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage. On April 17, 1997, in the first game of a first-round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens' empty net to ensure a 5-2 victory. It was only the second time in NHL history that a goaltender had scored in the playoffs, and the fifth time overall. The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers.  The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. Once again, Brodeur made the All-Star Team, finished as a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, and won the Jennings Trophy.  In the 1998-99 season, the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All-Star game, making his fourth appearance. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins. It was Brodeur's worst playoff performance to date statistically, as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an .856 save percentage.

I2a1b1 (L621) represents one particular subclade or branch on the human Y-DNA family tree. Before diving into the distribution of I2a1b1, it is worth mentioning that the original answer mentioned I2a2 as opposed to I2a1b1. I2a2 is a different subclade and should not be confused with the I2a1b1 in the context of the question. The two subclades have distinct genetic markers and geographical distribution patterns. Coming back to I2a1b1, this subclade is predominantly found in Southeastern and Eastern Europe. Given that this haplogroup is the focus of the question, the distribution of I2a1b1 should be explored further. A few of the primary regions with high concentrations of I2a1b1 are: 1. The Dinaric Alps: This area has been recognized as the primary hotspot for I2a1b1, where it reaches its highest frequency in the Balkans. The Dinaric Alps span across several countries in Southeastern Europe, including Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Albania.  2. The Western Balkans: Countries in the Western Balkan region, including Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia, also exhibit a significant concentration of I2a1b1. 3. Slavic-speaking populations: I2a1b1 is significantly present among Slavic populations, particularly the South Slavs, which include ethnic groups such as Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Montenegrins, Macedonians, and Slovenes. In conclusion, I2a1b1 (L621) is found in the highest concentrations in Southeastern Europe, particularly among populations inhabiting the Dinaric Alps and the Western Balkans, as well as among South Slavic populations. This distribution can be used to determine the haplogroup's evolutionary history and the migrations it has undergone over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question The Peoples Party – known as the Peoples Revolutionary Party between 1924 and 2010 – formed the government from 1921 to 1996 (in a One-party state until 1990) and from 2000 to 2004. From 2004 to 2006, it was part of a coalition with the Democrats and two other parties, and after 2006 it was the dominant party in two other coalitions. The party initiated two changes of government from 2004 prior to losing power in the 2012 election. The Democrats were the dominant force in a ruling coalition between 1996 and 2000, and an almost-equal partner with the Peoples Revolutionary Party in a coalition between 2004 and 2006. An election of deputies to the national assembly on 28 June 2012 resulted in no party having an overall majority; however, as the Democratic Party won the largest number of seats, its leader, Norovyn Altankhuyag, was appointed Prime Minister of Mongolia on August 10, 2012. In 2014, he was replaced by Chimediin Saikhanbileg. The Mongolian Peoples Party won a landslide victory in the Mongolian legislative election, 2016 and the current Prime Minister of Mongolia is Mongolian Peoples Partys Jargaltulgyn Erdenebat. How many years was Chimediin Saikhanbileg Prime Minster for?","output":"To find how many years Chimediin Saikhanbileg was the Prime Minister, we need to identify when he started and when he ended his term.  According to the article: 1. Chimediin Saikhanbileg replaced Norovyn Altankhuyag in 2014. 2. The Mongolian Peoples Party won a landslide victory in the Mongolian legislative election, 2016, and Jargaltulgyn Erdenebat became the Prime Minister. So, Chimediin Saikhanbileg started his term in 2014 and ended in 2016. Now we can calculate the number of years he served as Prime Minister: 2016 (end year) - 2014 (start year) = 2 years Chimediin Saikhanbileg was the Prime Minister of Mongolia for 2 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...  I am facing a new situation today: Two farmers provide a neighboring city with plenty of produce every year. Brick farm has a lot of plant problems, their plants experience abiotic stress. Boulder farm had a good production because their plants presented almost no signs of abiotic stress.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which farm has more plants displaying a decreased capacity to take up water? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided, Brick farm has more plants displaying a decreased capacity to take up water due to experiencing abiotic stress. As mentioned in the background article, one of the primary responses to abiotic stress, such as high salinity, is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the plant cell's cytoplasm. High concentrations of Na+ can decrease the plant's capacity to take up water and alter enzyme and transporter functions. Since Brick farm's plants experience a higher level of abiotic stress, they are more likely to have a decreased capacity to take up water compared to the plants at Boulder farm, which show almost no signs of abiotic stress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Gordon Strachan compared Scotland's bruising, euphoric victory over the Republic of Ireland to a heavyweight title fight. Shaun Maloney's sublime goal 15 minutes from the end of a tight, nip-and-tuck qualifier with the Irish completed a memorable and crucial Euro 2016 victory. Drawing level with the Republic on seven points after Poland's emphatic 4-0 win in Georgia, the Scots secured all three points in a frenetic clash. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch. Shaun Maloney (left) celebrates as Steven Naismith (centre) gives chase after Scotland open the scoring. Strachan will now ring the changes for Tuesday's friendly with England after admitting the game wrung every ounce of effort from his men. 'I think so,' confirmed the Scots boss. 'They put so much into that game tonight. That was like one of those big heavyweight boxing matches. 'I absolutely wouldn't second-guess the outcome of this group now.' The Scots had some sterling individual displays in goalscorer Maloney and man-of-the-match Charlie Mulgrew, called into midfield after an illness to James Morrison before the game. 'Charlie was immense, absolutely immense,' said Strachan. 'Normally we would come in here and say: 'What a game Scott Brown has had'. But Charlie has actually taken the mantle tonight and ably backed up by the people round about him. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan celebrates on the touchline at full-time as his side win 1-0. 'I am really pleased with Shaun as well, as I am with Steven Naismith, Ikechi Anya and others but Charlie was the best man on the pitch I think — ably backed by the others. 'But the smaller ones like Andrew Robertson, Maloney, Naismith and Anya showed brave play when the ball was flying about and there were tackles everywhere. 'They showed bravery on the ball.' Poland's triumph in Tblisi ramped up the pressure on the Scots before kick-off. Strachan had dismissed talk of a 'must-win' beforehand, but the joyous celebrations of the Tartan Army afterwards told another tale. 'People have been telling me since the Georgia game it is must-win,' the Scotland boss said. 'They said it before Poland and this one. Every game seems to be a must-win. 'I said before the game that one goal had decided all of the previous games in the group, apart from the one involving Gibraltar. It has happened again. 'We did say set plays were going to be vital and it happened. 'As for a pure footballing spectacle, it wasn't that great. Maloney curls a low strike into the far corner as Scotland take the lead in Glasgow on Friday. 'But as a spectacle of two groups of players not wanting to give an inch, it was mesmerising. They all wanted to jump higher than each other, run quicker and battle harder.' The Scots blew a raft of chances in both halves and survived a moment of anxiety in injury time when Grant Hanley's defensive header almost spun into his own net, crashing off the bar. Insisting his team now believe in themselves after one defeat in four matches — to world champions Germany in the opener — Strachan added: 'When we've played we've believed we can play football. Tonight it was a more physical duel. Charlie Mulgrew (centre) celebrates the victory as Scotland move up to third in Group D. 'We dealt with that as well because the players trust each other. 'They know fine well if they're not having a great night the guy next to him will help them out. 'And I think that's what happened tonight.' Asked what his over-riding emotions were ahead of an England friendly at the same venue, Strachan said: 'There are lot of emotions chucked in there, every emotion possible. But the good thing is I can go home, get to my bed and chill. That's what I'll do, go home and watch a bit of telly and fall asleep. I'm looking forward to that.'

Please briefly summarize this news article: The FTC is getting a new chief technologist: Carnegie Mellon’s Lorrie Cranor The Federal Trade Commission is one of the government's major online privacy watchdogs. And it's getting a new chief technologist: Carnegie Mellon University professor Lorrie Cranor, who will step into the role in January. “Technology is playing an ever more important role in consumers’ lives, whether through mobile devices, personal fitness trackers, or the increasing array of Internet-connected devices we find in homes and elsewhere,” FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said Thursday in a press release announcing the shift. “[Cranor] will play a key role in helping guide the many areas of FTC work involving new technologies and platforms.\\" Cranor teaches computer science and engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon, where she serves as the director of the university's CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory. She's also on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and previously worked at AT&T Labs Research. In an email statement, Cranor said she looks forward \\"to participating in the great work the agency has done in the areas of consumer privacy and data security.\\" She will replace Ashkan Soltani, who has served as chief technologist since November 2014. Soltani was a privacy practitioner who worked with The Washington Post to parse technical details of surveillance programs revealed by documents from Edward Snowden. That's different from the academics who previously held the job. \\"I was definitely an anomaly,\\" Soltani said, but added that his background was helpful because it gave \\"the agency insight into what the industry is doing.\\" Cranor will return the job to academic hands, a tradition started with the agency's first chief technologist, Princeton professor Ed Felten, who now serves as a deputy U.S. chief technology officer at the White House. The flexibility of academics to take sabbaticals so they can work for the government is likely a factor in that trend -- and one that has led to short terms when those academics return to their old posts. Cranor will be the fifth person in the job since Felten first took it up in 2011, and no one has lasted two years. In fact, Soltani's 14-month stint was on the longer side of the spectrum for the job. \\"There's not a lot of people who would be qualified for, and would take, this role,\\" Soltani said. Cranor, he added, is a \\"big score\\" for the agency. It's unclear what Soltani's own next steps will be, but the agency expanded its technical capacity during his time in its top tech spot. In March, it launched a new office dedicated to technology research and investigations. That same month, it also took steps to secure visitor's connections to its web sites. But the FTC also lost some privacy enforcement ground to the Federal Communications Commission this year when a regulatory shift put the network activities of Internet Service Providers outside of its grasp. The two agencies are trying to work together on consumer privacy issues as the FCC is beefing up its own technology staff. Andrea Peterson covers technology policy for The Washington Post, with an emphasis on cybersecurity, consumer privacy, transparency, surveillance and open government.

Black and white images that can be colored in by your child are also great.","output":"Once you have gathered the images, gather your materials, including various colored pencils, markers, or paints for your child to express their creativity while coloring in the images, as well as sturdy cardstock, scissors, a hole puncher, clear fishing line or string, a circular or rectangular wooden dowel or ring (preferably between 12-18 inches in length or diameter, depending on the size of your mobile), and some fun Halloween-themed decorations such as fake spiderwebs, plastic spiders, or even decorative orange and black ribbon. Begin by deciding on the layout and arrangement of the images on your Halloween mobile – this can range from a simple cascading design to a more complex multi-tiered arrangement. Once the layout has been finalized, print or trace the chosen images onto the cardstock, ensuring they are an appropriate size to fit the desired design, and cut them out carefully with scissors or a craft knife. Next, let your child color in the images using their preferred coloring method, taking care to encourage their artistic flair and imagination in bringing the Halloween characters to life. Allow the colored images to dry if necessary, and then use the hole puncher to create small holes at the top of each image, making sure they are evenly spaced and centered to ensure proper balance in the mobile. Cut strings or fishing line to various lengths, bearing in mind the design of the mobile and creating a visually appealing staggered effect. Attach the strings to the images by threading them through the punched holes and securing them with a simple knot or even a small dab of glue to ensure they remain in place. Now it is time to assemble the mobile's structure. To do this, take the wooden dowel or ring and attach the Halloween decorations to it, creating a festive and eye-catching base. Next, tie the other end of the strings with the images to the dowel or ring, ensuring they are spaced out evenly and maintaining the desired layout. If using a dowel, you may need to attach additional support strings on either end, forming a \\"V\\" shape to hang your mobile. If using a ring, simply add a string at the top and gather the ends to create a single hanging point. Once your mobile is assembled, find a suitable location to display your unique Halloween creation, ensuring it is high enough to avoid accidental bumps and tugs from enthusiastic trick-or-treaters. Hanging your mobile near a window or light source will provide the best effect, as it will cast intriguing and playful shadows around the room as it rotates gently. Take pride in your artistic collaboration with your child and enjoy the whimsical touch of spooky charm this Halloween mobile brings to your home during the festive season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What was offered to the city of Reykjavík as a gift? from the following article ?  The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year.

These vocalizations are specifically designed for echolocation and are usually in a frequency range that is optimal for the bat to detect, often being ultrasonic, meaning they are above the range of human hearing. Before the sound travels in waves, the bat generates these calls or clicks that act as the source of the sound waves it will eventually use to locate objects in its environment. These vocalizations are produced at regular intervals or sometimes in rapid succession, allowing the bat to gather continuous or near-continuous information about its surroundings. The frequency, intensity, and duration of these calls may vary depending on the species of bat and the specific situation it is in, such as foraging, navigating, or socializing. Once the bat has produced these echolocation calls, the rest of the process, as described in the original list, can begin. The emitted sound will travel in waves, bounce off objects, and return to the bat as echoes. Through specialized adaptations in their ears and brain, bats are then able to interpret these echoes to determine information about their environment, such as distance, size, shape, and texture of those objects. This allows bats to skillfully navigate and find food sources even in complete darkness. Other animals, such as dolphins and some species of birds, also use echolocation in generally similar ways to navigate and hunt for prey in their respective environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He won't play in a neighborhood where government minders are lurking and watching. He won't have to praise and thank the president before giving a book report. He won't fear talking about politics, afraid that he'll say something the regime doesn't like. \\"My son represents the new Tunisia,\\" Ben Salah, a Tunisian native, recently told CNN. \\"I will tell him what I had to do and what I grew up with and he'll understand that now there is no fear. Fear left with Ben Ali. May he and that fear never come back.\\" A year ago, the 28-year-old posted an iReport about what it was like to grow up in Tunisia under former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. As she wrote, Tunisia was in the throws of a historic revolution, a movement that would spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The movement, known as the Arab Spring, was born in Tunisia with a street vendor's self-immolation last year on December 17. Mohamed Bouazizi was reportedly pushed to such extraordinary ends after a municipal official and her aides were alleged to have harassed and humiliated him, and confiscated his goods. Tunisians viewed Bouazizi's act to be the ultimate protest against corruption in Ben Ali's government that they blamed for high unemployment and a lack of speech and political freedom. Throngs of Tunisians took to the streets demanding the ouster of Ben Ali who became president in 1987. Following the 28-day Tunisian revolt that toppled Ben Ali, revolt spread in other countries: Egypt and the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The civil war in Libya and death of Moammar Gadhafi. Continued protests in countries such as Yemen and Bahrain. And a series of bloody demonstrations in Syria. WHO'S GONE AND WHO'S HOLDING ONTO POWER? \\"To know that the Arab Spring started in Tunisia is just something that warms my heart. It fills me with a love of my country that I thought I would not feel because it was so hard there for many years,\\" Salah says. \\"I am so glad that tyrant is gone.\\" Ben Ali resigned and fled to Saudi Arabia in middle January 2011. A Tunisian military court in late November sentenced him in absentia to five years in prison for his role in a 1991 case in which 17 servicemen were accused of plotting a coup against his regime, the state-run Tunisian News Agency reported. Salah will travel to Tunisia with her baby in late December to celebrate. Salah has been pursuing a doctorate in mechanical engineering in California, and wasn't in Tunisia for the protests. But she communicated frequently on the phone and over Skype with her parents during the demonstrations. Her family lives in the same town where she was raised, in Le Kram, a 15-minute drive from the presidential palace near Tunis, the capital. She recalled to CNN this week the thrilling phone and Skype conversations she had with her family when the protests were happening. \\"The first conversation with my family -- we talked for so long because we were so excited,\\" she recalls. \\"We were just shouting, a lot of relatives jumping in to say something. It was odd because there were curfews in Le Kram and Tunis, and my parents were telling me that the neighbors were protecting their houses because the police weren't working. But no one was stealing or hurting each other.\\" Salah's father would occasionally interrupt during the calls, afraid that their conversations were being monitored by the government. \\"He would say, 'Let's not talk. Maybe this is dangerous. We shouldn't,'\\" she remembers. \\"And yes, it was scary a little but we were all too excited. It was joy, relief, no fear at all.\\" Salah said her friends and family say that when Ben Ali was ousted, change occurred almost immediately. They were small and slow changes in the way people lived, but they were deeply meaningful. \\"My family would say that they heard people talking in the streets and before you just didn't talk to anyone because you didn't want to be overheard saying something against Ben Ali,\\" she says. \\"Now you can go to a coffee shop and hear people for the first time talking politics. They just talk and talk politics even if they don't understand it because they are so excited to have this freedom.\\" Salah's own family enjoyed these new political freedoms. During the October election in Tunisia, she supported one party while her parents supported another and they often talked openly about their different opinions. In December, Tunisia's new president, Moncef Marzouki, was sworn in. The veteran human rights activist, who had been imprisoned during Ben Ali's regime, was elected by an Islamist-dominated parliament, the Constituent Assembly. \\"For people in the West, they may not understand what a big deal that is,\\" Salah says. \\"Tunisians understand it and that's what really matters.

Reindeer to be culled in Russia’s far north due to anthrax outbreak A governor in Russia’s far north has said the reindeer population will be reduced by 100,000 after an anthrax outbreak, but scientists have said twice as many need to be culled. Reindeer herding is an important industry and livelihood for indigenous peoples in the Yamal-Nenets region. Its governor, Dmitry Kobylkin, told state news agency RIA Novosti that about 100,000 reindeer would be culled this winter because overpopulation was straining a limited food supply and increasing the risk of anthrax infection. An outbreak in Yamal-Nenets – the first since 1941 – killed a 12-year-old boy and more than 2,500 reindeer in July and August. Scientists and officials blamed the awakening of the “zombie infection” on abnormally hot temperatures caused by global climate change. Thawing of the permafrost soil can release the frozen bacteria. “For [lack of fodder], some herder families take their animals to graze in restricted areas where there’s a high risk of Siberian plague infection,” Kobylkin said, using the Russian name for anthrax, a bacterial infection often transmitted through contaminated food or water. Regional authorities will buy the reindeer to be culled and process the meat, he said. Officials have said reindeer meat exports could increase from 300 tonnes last year to 800 tonnes this year. More than 750,000 reindeer live in the Yamal-Nenets region, even though the region’s pasture land can support only 386,000 reindeer without degrading, Vladimir Bogdanov, director of the Urals Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta. At least 200,000 reindeer need to be culled, he said. Reindeer overpopulation compounds the anthrax risk. Over-grazing reduces the plant cover, which serves as a buffer to protect the permafrost from thawing in the summer sun. In addition, reindeer grazing where plant cover is thin tend to eat soil along with lichen, becoming infected that way, Bogdanov said. “If steps aren’t taken, there will be a mass die-off in the near future,” he said. “The animals won’t hold out against lack of fodder and various diseases.” But reducing the reindeer population is a thorny political issue, since that is how many indigenous people earn a living. Following Kobylkin’s remarks, reindeer herder Yeiko Serotetto started a petition to president Vladimir Putin calling for the reindeer population to be preserved. He argued that there would be no risk of anthrax infection if the government hadn’t stopped vaccinating reindeer against the disease in 2007, and said the cull was “motivated by the interests of the gas drilling industry”. Oil and gas exploration in the far north has led to increasing conflicts with indigenous peoples in recent years. Kobylkin said regional authorities are “working on the issue of job placement for the local population” after the planned cull.

Scientists argue that at least 200,000 reindeer need to be culled to mitigate the risks. The overpopulation leads to overgrazing, which reduces plant cover. This, in turn, affects permafrost thawing, which can release frozen bacteria. The culling plan is a controversial issue due to its impact on the livelihood of indigenous peoples who rely on reindeer herding. Some argue that vaccination programs and addressing the needs of the oil and gas industry would help maintain the population without posing anthrax risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years was it between when the Danish claimed St. John to when the population of African slaves on St. John was more than five times larger than that of the Euopean inhabitants?","output":"Title: The Emergence of St. John's Enslaved African Population  Introduction St. John, a picturesque island in the United States Virgin Islands, has a rich history imbued with European colonialism and the forced migration of Africans. Understanding the population dynamics of the island requires delving into the tumultuous past that shaped this Caribbean paradise. This article explores the timeline of Danish colonization of St. John and the subsequent point at which the African slave population exceeded five times that of European inhabitants on the island. Step 1: Establish the timeline for Danish colonization The Danish West India Company first claimed the island of St. John on March 25, 1718. This initiation marked the beginning of Danish rule, which was aimed at establishing a continuous Danish presence in the Caribbean, capitalizing on the highly profitable sugar cultivation trade. Denmark's colonization of St. John inevitably resulted in the large-scale importation of enslaved Africans to work on the burgeoning sugar plantations. Step 2: Analyze the evolution of the population dynamics Population statistics from the Danish period illustrate the increasing number of Africans forcibly brought to St. John. As sugar plantations expanded rapidly, so did the demand for labor. In 1721, there were approximately 28 European inhabitants and 216 African slaves on the island. This ratio reflects the early stages of the plantation system, as it indicates that the African slave population was almost eight times larger than the number of European settlers. The African slave population continued to grow throughout the 18th century. By 1733, the number of enslaved Africans had reached around 1,087, while the number of European inhabitants remained relatively stable at around 208. Step 3: Determine the point where the African slave population exceeded five times that of European inhabitants  To determine the point at which the African slave population exceeded five times that of the Europeans, we need to perform a simple calculation. Let's denote the number of European inhabitants as E, and the number of African slaves as A. We aim to find the lowest number of years, Y, after 1718 that satisfies the inequality A > 5E.  Considering the population statistics from 1721, just three years after Danish colonization, the African slave population was already nearly eight times larger than the European population. Given the numbers mentioned earlier (28 European inhabitants and 216 African slaves), the inequality A > 5E is satisfied, as 216 > 5 * 28. Conclusion In conclusion, the African slave population on St. John exceeded five times that of European inhabitants just three years after Denmark claimed the island in 1718. This distressing transformation speaks volumes about the exploitative nature of European colonialism and the atrocities endured by enslaved Africans throughout history. The legacy of this dark period in St. John's history lives on through the descendants of those who survived, and it is essential to remember and honor their resilience and courage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What building has a clock on the front?  The White House is connected to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in the centre of the building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock on the front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site. Close to the estate entrance, The Lodge was built in 1934 as the Camp Chief's (later succeeded by the Director of Programme and Development) home. The building is now used to accommodate Scout Association staff and host internal meetings. The Gilwell Farm is the oldest building on the site still standing, dating from the 1600s. The building started as two separate cottages. In the grounds of the building is the last remaining well on site, known as Gil Well. The Farm was refurbished from its derelict site, opening in 2015 as the new offices and reception of Scout Adventures Gilwell Park . Close by, The Leopard Gates mark the original entrance to Gilwell Park, and were carved by Gilwlel master craftsman Don Potter in 1928. The Lid, which originally consisted of a roof but no walls, was a wet weather shelter built in 1967. In 2009, the building was renovated and now consists of a large activity hall, two classrooms, staff space and a large store room added The activity hall houses all the indoor activities on-site, including an archery range and climbing walls. In front of The Lid, is the Tait McKenzie Statue, gifted by the Boy Scouts of America in 1966. The Barnacle was built in 1950 as a First Aid centre, which quickly became a volunteer-run cottage hospital for visitors and the local community. It houses a 6-bed ward, isolation room, dental surgery, X-ray room and operating theatre. In the late 1980s the building became volunteer...

The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex.

Although Satsunan literally means the south of Satsuma Province, the north-eastern group of the Ōsumi Islands formed Tane Province for a brief period in the 8th and 9th centuries and then were merged into Ōsumi Province. The Tokara Islands and the northwestern group of the Ōsumi Islands belonged to Kawanabe District of Satsuma Province. The Amami Islands paid tribute to the Ryukyu Kingdom to the South until they were put under direct control in the late 16th century, but were conquered in 1609 by the Satsuma Domain. In 1879, the Amami Islands became Ōshima District of Kagoshima Prefecture. The Tokara Islands and the north-western group of the Ōsumi Islands were transferred to Ōshima District in 1897, and then to Kagoshima District in 1973. After World War II, the Tokara and Amami Islands were put under United States military occupation, which formed the Government of the Northern Ryukyus. The Japanese government fiercely contested the Amami Islands being affiliated with the word \\"Ryukyu\\", believing that it would lead to a later return of the islands to their control. The Tokara Islands were returned to Japan in 1952, which were followed by the Amami Islands in December 1953. Answer this question: How many years after the Tokara Islands were returned to Japan were the Amami Islands returned?","output":"The Tokara Islands were returned to Japan in 1952, and the Amami Islands were returned in December 1953. To determine the difference in years between these two events: 1. Consider the years of the events: 1952 for the return of the Tokara Islands and 1953 for the return of the Amami Islands. 2. Subtract the year of the first event from the year of the second event: 1953 - 1952 = 1.

Born in Brooklyn, Graziano later moved to an Italian enclave centered on East 10th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A in Manhattan's East Village. He grew up as a street fighter and learned to look after himself before he could read or write. Context: Graziano heard from a couple of his friends about a tournament going on with a gold medal for the winner. He entered under the name of Joe Giuliani and was trained by Tobias (Toby) Zaccaria of Kings County (Brooklyn), NY. He fought four matches and ended up winning the New York Metropolitan Amateur Athletic Union Boxing Competition (1939). He sold the gold medal for 15 and decided that boxing was a good way to make cash.  A couple of weeks into amateur fighting, Graziano was picked up for stealing from a school. He went to Coxsackie Correctional Facility, where he spent three weeks, with boyhood friend Jake LaMotta, and then he went on to the New York City Reformatory where he spent five months. After he got out of the reformatory, he headed back to the gym to earn money and while there, met Eddie Cocco who started his professional career. He entered the ring under the name Robert Barber. A couple of weeks later, Graziano was charged with a probation violation and sent back to reform school where he was charged with starting a minor  riot. He was then sent to Rikers Island.  When Graziano got out of jail he enlisted in the military but went AWOL after punching a captain. He escaped from Fort Dix in New Jersey and started his real boxing career under the name of \\"Rocky Graziano\\". He won his first couple of bouts. After gaining popularity under the name of Graziano, he was found by the military. After his fourth bout, he was called into manager's office to speak with a couple of military personnel. Expecting to be prosecuted and sent back to the military or jail, he fled. He returned to the military a week later. He turned himself in, but he was pardoned and given the opportunity to fight under the army's aegis. Question: How did his amateur career begin? Answer:","output":"Graziano's amateur career began when he heard about a tournament with a gold medal for the winner.

Given the question: The answer to the question: Which organization does Sir John Hamilton's servant betray? is inside the article: County Cork, Ireland, 1920. Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to \\"execute the spies\\"., can you guess it ? The answer is:","output":"The organization that Sir John Hamilton's servant, Chris Reilly, betrays is the Irish Republican Army (IRA).

With Steve McNair still recovering from a groin injury, QB Kyle Boller was given the start for this Back-Up Bowl (due to the fact Kellen Clemens was filling in for an injured Chad Pennington).  In the first quarter, Baltimore took to the skies early with Boller completing a 2-yard TD pass to RB Willis McGahee for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Jets responded with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 50-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Ravens responded with kicker Matt Stover getting a 28-yard field goal and Boller completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE Todd Heap. After a scoreless third quarter, Baltimore increased its lead with Stover kicking a 43-yard field goal.  However, the Jets began to show some fight within them as Nugent kicked a 21-yard field goal, while Clemens completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Chris Baker.  Fortunately, the Ravens defense held its ground and LB Ray Lewis managed to get the game-winning interception. With the win, not only did Baltimore improve to 1-1, but it made the Ravens 4-0 against the Jets while under Head Coach Brian Billick. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1 \\"You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in this case your talents are quite thrown away.\\" This sentence tells us that Mr. Hastings is considered an excellent advocate in general, but in this specific case, his talents are wasted or not put to good use. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 \\"Mr. Hastings has better uses for his talents.\\" This sentence implies that there are more suitable or effective ways for Mr. Hastings to utilize his talents. Step 3: Compare both sentences Sentence 1 states that Mr. Hastings' talents are wasted in a specific situation, whereas Sentence 2 suggests that there are better ways for him to use his talents. Essentially, both sentences point to the idea that Mr. Hastings could apply his skills more effectively in different scenarios. Step 4: Evaluate if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence Keeping in mind the analysis from the previous steps, we can infer that if the first sentence is true (i.e., Mr. Hastings' talents are wasted in a specific case), then it is reasonable to conclude that there must indeed be better uses for his talents, thus making the second sentence true as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The album was Slayer's ninth studio recording, and was released on August 8, 2006. During reviews \\"Jihad\\" received a mixed reception.

It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda.\\" Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as: ..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for \\"difficult\\" subjects in the past—Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in \\"Angel of Death\\" or Jeffrey Dahmer/Ed Gein's ghoulish proclivities in \\"213\\" and \\"Dead Skin Mask\\"—with great effect.

The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim?  Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.","output":"Based on the given information, it is stated that Dan is a normal patient with a normal number of red blood cells, while Jim is a patient with sickle-cell anemia. Although the question appears to ask about the quantity of red blood cells, it is crucial to understand the difference in the quality of these cells before answering the question. The primary role of red blood cells, as mentioned, is to transport oxygen throughout the body using the protein hemoglobin. The sickle-cell anemia develops due to a certain mutation in the gene responsible for creating hemoglobin. This mutation leads to an altered structure of the protein, causing the hemoglobin to clump together. Consequently, the red blood cells also become distorted and take on a crescent (sickle) shape. Now, addressing the question of which patient has more red blood cells, it is important to note that the total number of red blood cells may not necessarily be significantly different between Dan, who is a normal patient, and Jim, who has sickle-cell anemia. However, the efficiency and functionality of these cells are highly different between the two patients. While Dan has a normal hemoglobin structure that effectively carries and transports oxygen, Jim's altered hemoglobin structure leads to a diminished ability to carry and transport oxygen throughout the body. Additionally, the sickle-shaped cells in Jim's blood are more prone to breaking down, which can cause anemia—a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells. Although it could be possible that Jim might have lower red blood cells due to anemia as a consequence of sickle-cell anemia, it is essential to emphasize the primary difference between Dan and Jim lies in the quality and functionality of the red blood cells and not necessarily the quantity. To definitively determine which patient has more red blood cells, a direct laboratory measurement of their red blood cell count would be required. However, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Dan has a normal number of healthy red blood cells, while Jim possesses sickle-shaped cells, which could very likely lead to a lower number of cells due to anemia resulting from his sickle-cell condition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Retail therapy has long been considered as a good way to let off stress. Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \\"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \\"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters. Answer:","output":"Question: According to the article, what could be causing retail therapy in materialistic people? A. The excitement of finding new and unique items B. An individual's fear of sudden death due to events such as terrorism, disease, and natural disasters C. The social aspect of shopping with friends and family D. A general love for shopping and spending money Answer: B. An individual's fear of sudden death due to events such as terrorism, disease, and natural disasters Justification: In the article, it is mentioned that US scientists discovered that retail therapy might be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. This fear of death could be due to acts of terrorism, disease, and natural disasters.

Out of fear, Oskar never fights back. In the evenings, however, he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors. One evening, Oskar notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into #15, the apartment next door to his. Oddly, the first thing they do is to cover the windows with cardboard. What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood. Consequently, Eli is beginning to get hungry.One evening, as Oskar is in the courtyard stabbing a tree in lieu of his tormentors, he notices Eli watching him. She's not very friendly, as she tells him right off that she can't be friends with him. The next evening, they run into each other again in the courtyard. Oskar notices that Eli is not wearing a coat even though it's the dead of winter in Stockholm. What's more, she's not even cold. And she smells bad.

Frank Baum, the author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and various other novels, lived in several places during his life. Born on May 15, 1856, in Chittenango, New York, Baum spent his early years in the town and its surrounding area. His father, Benjamin Ward Baum, was a successful businessman who owned a barrel factory and later ventured into other businesses, including oil drilling. In his childhood, Baum's family moved to a large estate called \\"Rose Lawn\\" in Mattydale, New York, where he spent many of his formative years. In 1880, Baum moved to South Dakota to join his brother Charles, who had established a homestead under the Free Land Act. He started a business in Aberdeen, a newspaper named The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, where he served as an editor and publisher from 1888 until 1891. However, due to the inadequacy of the business, Baum turned to theater and writing, which eventually led him to move to Chicago, Illinois, in 1891. The family moved to Humboldt Park, a residential area located on the west side of the city. While in Chicago, Baum worked as a newspaper reporter and continued honing his writing skills, producing various works of fiction and non-fiction. In 1900, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published, marking the start of his success as an author. Baum's rising fame and increasing financial stability enabled him to buy an estate in Macatawa, Michigan, in 1900. He affectionately named the yellow house \\"The Sign of the Goose\\" due to its unique design, which resembled a goose's head. The family spent their summers at the estate, where Baum wrote several of his Oz books. In 1910, due to health reasons, Baum moved with his family to Hollywood, California, just as the burgeoning film industry began to take shape. He lived in a residence called \\"Ozcot\\" at 1749 North Cherokee Avenue, designing the house and garden with an Oz-inspired theme. It was in Hollywood where Baum continued to produce successful Oz books and founded his own movie production company, The Oz Film Manufacturing Company. L. Frank Baum passed away on May 6, 1919, in Hollywood, California, after a life dedicated to storytelling. His legacy continues to live on through his beloved stories, which have been adapted into various films, plays, and other art forms throughout the years."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

By Harriet Arkell PUBLISHED: 03:49 EST, 13 May 2013 | UPDATED: 05:02 EST, 13 May 2013 A row has broken out between academics at two Oxford University colleges after a professor said a planned student accommodation block would spoil the views from his rooms. Jonathan Bate, provost of Worcester College and world-renowned Shakespeare expert, has complained that Exeter College's building would be 'overbearing, out of scale and out of character', and would 'obliterate' views from his rooms. However the Rector of Exeter College, Frances Cairncross, has hit back at Professor Bate, saying the accommodation is desperately needed for less well-off students and adding: 'We do not feel that colleges should go out of their way to deprive undergraduates of affordable accommodation.' 'Any further reduction will mean the loss of 14 student rooms – and that means 14 of our students each year will have to rent on the very expensive private market in Oxford instead of having subsidised Exeter College accommodation.' This disagreement highlights the constant struggle to balance the need for affordable student housing and maintaining the historic character of prestigious colleges like those found at Oxford University. While Professor Bate's concerns regarding the aesthetics of the new building are understandable, considering the rich history and architectural beauty of the university, Rector Cairncross argues that the needs of the students should not be overshadowed by the desire to preserve certain views. In reality, the conflict between preserving historic sites and accommodating the growing demand for affordable student living extends far beyond Oxford University. Universities, colleges, and city councils across the globe are grappling with the challenge of providing adequate, affordable housing while still preserving the integrity and character of their institutions and local communities. In their efforts to address this issue, several universities have adopted various strategies such as offering financial aid packages that include housing subsidies, partnering with local developers to create affordable housing units off-campus, or converting existing buildings into student residences while maintaining their historical appearance. In the case of Exeter College, a feasible solution might lie in finding a compromise that addresses both the concerns of Professor Bate and the needs of the students. Dialogue between the two parties should be encouraged, with the possibility of gathering feedback from the broader university community, including students, faculty, and alumni, which would help establish a consensus on the best course of action. Whichever path is chosen, it is crucial that universities and colleges prioritize both the well-being of their students and the preservation of their invaluable historical legacies. Only through careful collaboration and consideration of all factors involved can these institutions maintain the delicate balancing act between progress and preservation."},{"instruction":"Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Answer a question about this article: The late Georgian period saw the birth of the semi-detached house, planned systematically, as a suburban compromise between the terraced houses of the city and the detached \\"villas\\" further out, where land was cheaper. There had been occasional examples in town centres going back to medieval times. Most early suburban examples are large, and in what are now the outer fringes of Central London, but were then in areas being built up for the first time. Blackheath, Chalk Farm and St John's Wood are among the areas contesting being the original home of the semi. Sir John Summerson gave primacy to the Eyre Estate of St John's Wood.

The French Wars, a series of military conflicts between France and various European powers that lasted from 1792 to 1802 and later from 1803 to 1815, disrupted the development of this housing plan. Economic instability and resources being diverted to support the war efforts likely contributed to this delay. However, when the development was eventually built after the wars, it retained the semi-detached house format, representing a significant and influential change in housing design at that time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida.  - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.  - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.  - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company.  - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions.  - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s.  - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard.  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US  25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO . Pfeiffer served through the 1990s . Ben Rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for 18 years from 1983 until September 28 , 2000 , when he retired and was succeeded by Michael Capellas , who served as the last Chairman and CEO until its merger with HP. Prior to its takeover the company was headquartered in a facility in northwest unincorporated Harris County , Texas , that now continues as HP 's largest United States facility .    What is the relationship between 'compaq' and 'information technology'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Compaq' and 'information technology' lies in Compaq's role as a significant player in the development and popularization of personal computers (PCs) in the information technology sector. Compaq Computer Corporation was founded in 1982 and became a major producer of IBM PC-compatible computers, being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer. Compaq's contributions to the industry not only helped establish PC standards and compatibility but also influenced the landscape of information technology during the 1990s. At its peak, Compaq became the largest supplier of PC systems in the 1990s, a testament to its impact on the information technology market. As a pioneer in the development and sale of personal computers and related products and services, Compaq was an active participant in shaping the evolution and maturity of the IT industry throughout the late 20th century. The company's success and influence are evident in the wide adoption of PC-compatible devices, which facilitated the growth and dissemination of information technology, enabling millions of users to access and engage with digital content. Furthermore, the company's involvement with the Internet and the World Wide Web also highlights its relationship with information technology. The rapid growth of the Internet sector and related fields during the dot-com bubble, which took place from roughly 1995 to 2001, was closely tied to the widespread accessibility of personal computers. As a significant supplier of these PCs, Compaq played an essential role in making information technology more accessible to a broader population, thus fostering innovation and communication within the global digital ecosystem. Although Compaq was ultimately acquired by HP in 2002 and the brand was eventually phased out in 2013, its legacy within the information technology industry remains. The company's success in creating IBM PC-compatible devices and catering to an expanding market for personal computers has solidified its place as an influential player in the development and popularization of information technology during the late 20th century. Through its products and services, Compaq contributed to the growth and adoption of computing technologies that now form the foundation for many aspects of modern life and business."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Listening to a story about an approaching planet that looks just like Earth on the radio, she looks out her car window up to the stars and inadvertly slams her car through a stopped car at an intersection, putting John Burroughs (William Mapother) in a coma and killing his wife and son. Rhoda is a minor, so her identity is not revealed to John. After serving her prison sentence, Rhoda does not go to MIT, but becomes a janitor at a local school, wanting to physically clean things with her hands but not do too much thinking.After cleaning a school for a while and hearing more news stories about the approaching mirror Earth, Rhoda visits John's house after he has recovered, thinking she will apologize for the harm she did to him. He answers the door and she loses her nerve. Instead, she pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for Maid'n Haven (a New Haven based maid service). John, who has nearly dropped out of his Yale music faculty position and is now living in a depressed and dirty stupor, agrees to Rhoda's offer. When she finishes, John, who still does not know she is the person who killed his wife and son, asks her to come back next week.

Here is an article: An ancient Mayan calendar claims that Burgarach, France (pictured), is the only place on Earth that will be saved from the apocalypse on December 21. (CNN) -- When the Mayan \\"Long Count\\" calendar ends on Friday, December 21, some people predict it could mark the end of the world as we know it. But despite the attention that December 21 is garnering, many apocalyptic believers don't actually give much thought to the hype surrounding the Mayan calendar. Some doomsday believers pinpointed 2012 as a pretty good year for disastrous solar flares, giant asteroids or global pole shifts that could likewise signal the apocalypse. Other theories that may or may not happen this year involve the Rapture, the catastrophic collapse of civilization or even a zombie uprising. There is diversity among apocalyptic \\"prepper\\" groups, and to paint them all with a broad stroke of the crazy brush is to ignore the nuances in what these various groups believe. John Hall, author of \\"Apocalypse: From Antiquity to the Empire of Modernity,\\" said groups organized around 2012 end-of-world predictions -- driven by pseudoscientific or numerological predictions -- are \\"more fanciful\\" than some other doomsday believers. That's because they look toward dramatic external events, as opposed to others that approach theories with a \\"fair amount of scientific basis,\\" such as the disappearance of natural resources. Read more: The apocalypse, by the numbers Although Hall and his colleagues have spent years trying to define or connect them, the groups can be as hard to explain as their disparate beliefs. \\"It's not like a pie of apocalyptic stories that can be divided up so much as it is a story where people coming from many different places can ... express the urgency of the crisis they foresee,\\" Hall said. For instance, Hall said the survivalists -- both those of the fundamentalist religious persuasion and the nonreligious -- are looking to opt out of post-apocalyptic strife. That analysis applies to Dan Martin, a survivalist living off the grid and author of \\"Apocalypse: How to Survive a Global Crisis,\\" a book that teaches skills for living a self-sufficient life after what he perceives to be an oncoming collapse of civilization and governments. He said his readers are \\"normal middle-class\\" soccer moms and teachers who read about world events and \\"connect the dots.\\" \\"Most of my readers aren't die-hard, end-of-the-world subscribers or enthusiasts,\\" he said. \\"They don't want things to change, but aren't ignorant to the fact that they most likely will within our own lifetime, so preparing for such a strong possibility isn't desperation or ignorance or naivety, it's just another insurance policy.\\" Insofar as civilization's collapse is something we're bringing upon ourselves with a little help from world powers, Martin and his readers might relate to radical environmentalists or peak oil environmentalists, who subscribe to the theory that there is a date when petroleum production will max out and decline rapidly. Debunking doomsday: 6 rumors dispelled Hall sees a connection between the survivalists and religious rapturists who \\"look at themselves as missing out on the agonies of the apocalypse because they're going someplace else.\\" Jerry Jenkins, co-author of the \\"Left Behind\\" book series about the Rapture within the Christian Bible's end-of-days Book of Revelation, doesn't completely agree with Hall's assessment. He said the media has incorrectly portrayed his readers as triumphalists who boast \\"We're going, you're not, too bad for you.\\" The whole point of the \\"Left Behind\\" books, Jenkins said, was to encourage people to read the Revelation prophecies because religious rapturists want all people to have a better life in heaven. \\"[We're not] saying 'good' people go and 'bad' people are left behind,\\" said Jenkins, who believes the key to being raptured (or taken into heaven before the Apocalypse happens on Earth) is to receive Jesus Christ. But Jenkins added that even those \\"looking forward to being rescued\\" are still dedicated to improving life for everyone on terra firma before they go. Interestingly, Jenkins said Christ himself said he didn't even know the day or hour of the Rapture, so the ilk of Christian radio broadcaster Harold Camping who attempt to predict its timing are \\"crazies\\" engaged in folly that \\"make us all look like idiots.\\" Camping claimed he was able to use the Bible to calculate the exact date of the Rapture (most recently it was supposed to be May 23, 2011, and before that in 1994). Those who point to science instead of Biblical lore to predict the end of the world are another apocalyptic subculture, according to Hall. These groups are comprised of theoretical physicists and futurologists -- such as Michio Kaku -- whom Hall calls \\"optimistic utopian prophets.\\" These people believe in the Technological Singularity theory: The possibility that technologically augmented intelligence will change human life as we know it or possibly wipe it out completely. There's even a think tank of sorts formed around this logic. The Singularity Institute is comprised of scientists, philosophers and philanthropists from places such as the Research Triangle and Silicon Valley, and universities such as Oxford, Harvard and Stanford, said Michael Anissimov, media director at The Singularity Institute. Their goal? Constructing a smarter-than-human intelligence that has the values of humanity. Instead of avoiding the growth of artificial intelligence, the Singularity Institute is trying to manage the risk. If peak oil theorists believe we're rapidly running out of a major resource, the institute postulates that technology itself is advancing so rapidly that society will have an overabundance of it -- and an artificial intelligence is set to emerge that will not necessarily pursue mankind's best interests. \\"We do think it's possible, if not probable, that it could actually lead to either the marginalization or end of humanity,\\" said Anissimov. Doomsday dining: Your last meal Whereas religious and scientific apocalyptic subcultures converge and diverge on various points, there is one end-of-world scenario that manages to reflect all their anxieties: the zombie apocalypse. The zombocalypse of popular culture has become something of a Rorschach test of apocalyptic fears. Depending on the point of view, zombies may result from an act of God, the irresponsible use of science, an environmental disaster, a cosmic event and so forth. Scott Kenemore, author of \\"The Zen of Zombie\\" and a member of the advisory board of the Zombie Research Society, said the zombie apocalypse can represent a validation of sorts for people awaiting their particular extinction event. Hall agreed that the pop-culture connection of zombies to apocalyptic groups is \\"a shared motif of a dystopian world emerging.\\" He added that zombies are a stand-in for \\"The Other,\\" an alien group, process or force that is \\"almost always\\" the basis for apocalyptic developments. Zombies can be a substitute for a corrupt government, an oil-based economy, foreigners or even a Sodom and Gomorrah society itself. \\"[H]ow you deal with the threat is an open question,\\" he said. Whatever route to the end (or new beginning), Hall thinks the very diversity of subcultures underscores the fact that we have reached an apocalyptic apex. \\"In this moment, people are seeing the old ways of life recede,\\" he said. \\"That's the occasion when all kinds of different people from all kinds of different directions come forward with one or another apocalyptic scenario.\\" Like CNN Living on Facebook Do you have a prediction for how the world will end?

Article: See more of Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook ||||| In the hope of avoiding future foreign meddling in elections, as was seen in 2016 US presidential campaign, Facebook announced today (April 6) some of its most significant efforts to date to boost transparency in political advertising. The moves come before CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before US lawmakers next week over a different scandal.      In October, Facebook said it would require advertisers running electoral ads to verify their identity and location. It will now extend that requirement to so-called “issue ads,” which aim to sway opinions on immigration, gun rights, the economy and other topics. Crucially, the company said it would now also verify the identity of administrators of pages with large followings, making it harder to run them from fake accounts. Facebook pages were used by Russian agents to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, according to the US Justice Department.      “These steps by themselves won’t stop all people trying to game the system,” Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his personal Facebook page. “But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads.”      Each electoral and issue ad will be labeled as “political” and will include information on who paid for it, which would be required by the Honest Ads Act, transparency legislation that has been introduced in Congress, a bill Facebook appears to be pre-empting with its new policies. Zuckerberg reiterated his support for the legislation in his post, although as Quartz has reported, the company has lobbied against it.      Facebook also said that a feature it has been testing in Canada, which allows users to see all the ads run by a given page in a separate tab—an experiment that critics have called insufficient and misleading—will be rolled out widely in June. At the same time, Facebook also plans to offer a repository of all political ads along with information on the ads’ audience and money spent on it.      “In order to require verification for all of these pages and advertisers, we will hire thousands of more people. We’re committed to getting this done in time for the critical months before the 2018 elections,” Zuckerberg said in the post.      In the company’s announcement, VPs Rob Goldman and Alex Himel encouraged users to report malicious ads as they see them. Facebook has in the past brought in thousands of workers to moderate content and attempt to mitigate fake news on its platform.      All of these moves are sure to make Zuckerberg’s testimony in Congress on April 11 just a tad easier, allowing him to point to the company’s specific moves to fix the problems it has caused. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO — For months, Facebook’s critics — ranging from Silicon Valley executives to Washington politicians — have been urging the company to do a better job of identifying who is buying political ads and creating pages about hot-button topics on its social media sites.      On Friday, just days before its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is expected to testify before Congress, Facebook said it had started forcing people who want to buy political or “issue” ads to reveal their identities and verify where they are.      Mr. Zuckerberg announced the move in a post on Facebook. He said this verification was meant to prevent foreign interference in elections, like the ads and posts from so-called Russian trolls before and after the 2016 presidential election.      Mr. Zuckerberg added that he supported a Senate bill, the Honest Ads Act, that would bring political advertising on the internet more in line with what is required on broadcast television. One of the sponsors of the bill, which has some bipartisan support but is still in the committee stage, said that statement was a reversal from what Facebook had earlier indicated. |||||Summary:","output":"Facebook is making changes to be more careful with political ads and pages. They want to make sure people know who is behind these ads and pages, and if they are real or just trying to cause trouble. This is because some people from other countries, like Russia, have been pretending to be someone else and making fake ads and pages on Facebook during important elections. Facebook's boss, Mark Zuckerberg, says these changes won't stop everyone from causing trouble, but they will make it harder for them to do so.

Here is an email: Here is the Commission's basic policy on reverse open seasons. I've asked Randy Rich to look into the other aspects of your questions, which we'll discuss shortly. The Commission has a two-step process for determining whether the market finds an expansion project economically viable. The first step, which occurs prior to the certificate application, is for the pipeline to conduct an open season in which existing customers are given an opportunity to permanently relinquish their capacity. This first step ensures that a pipeline will not expand capacity if the demand for that capacity can be filled by existing shippers relinquishing their capacity. The second step is that the expansion shippers must be willing to purchase capacity at a rate that pays the full costs of the project, without subsidy from existing shippers through rolled-in pricing. The reverse open season requirement (i.e., the requirement that a pipeline give customers the opportunity to turn back capacity) is established Commission policy. It was stated in the Commission's Pricing Policy for New and Existing Facilities Constructed by Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines, 71 FERC P61,241 at p. 61,917 (1995), reh'g denied, 75 FERC P61,105, and later reiterated in Certification on New interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (Certificate Policy Statement), 88 FERC P61,227 (1999), order clarifying statement of policy, 90 FERC P61,128, order further clarifying statement of policy, 92 FERC P61,094 (2000). My research has indicated that the Commission has provided few specifics on how a reverse open season is to be conducted. This probably allows pipelines considerable discretion in how they conduct their solicitations of turnback. General Commission policy would probably require only that shippers be given adequate notice of and opportunity to respond to the reverse open season. If the procedure used by El Paso for soliciting turnback becomes an issue, please let me know and let's discuss it. I'll be up in a few minutes for our call to Randy.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

Richmond, Virginia After the American Revolutionary War, Richmond emerged as an important industrial center. To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, George Washington helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal in the 18th century to bypass Richmond's rapids, with the intent of providing a water route across the Appalachians to the Kanawha River. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities of their kind in the South. The resistance to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century; in one famous case in 1848, Henry \\"Box\\" Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to abolitionists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, escaping slavery.

First question: When I sing, am I supposed to feel vibrations in my face? Second question: Why is my voice changing and I am not able to sing? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, I will address the first question: \\"When I sing, am I supposed to feel vibrations in my face?\\" Step 1: Consider the context of singing and how it produces sound. When you sing, your vocal cords vibrate to produce sound. This vibration is transferred through the air and can be felt in various parts of the body, depending on the frequency and intensity of the sound. Step 2: Identify the relevance of facial vibrations. Feeling vibrations in the face is quite common when singing, particularly in the areas around the nose, lips, and cheeks. These vibrations are more noticeable for certain styles of singing and specific notes or tones. Step 3: Conclude the response. Yes, it is normal to feel vibrations in your face when singing, as the vibrations from your vocal cords travel through the air and are felt in different parts of the body. Next, I will address the second question: \\"Why is my voice changing and I am not able to sing?\\" Step 1: Identify possible factors that influence voice changes. Several factors can cause voice changes, such as age, hormonal fluctuations, throat or vocal cord problems, illness, and even stress or fatigue. Step 2: Provide examples of factors. - If you are going through puberty, your voice may be changing because of hormonal fluctuations. - If you have recently been sick, your vocal cords could be temporarily affected. - Overuse or straining your voice can cause temporary or permanent damage in extreme cases. Step 3: Offer recommendation. It would be helpful to consult a vocal coach or medical professional if you are concerned about your voice changing and not being able to sing. Finally, I will address whether these two questions are asking the same thing: Step 1: Assess the focal points of each question. - The first question is regarding the sensation of facial vibrations while singing. - The second question is concerning changes in the user's voice and their ability to sing. Step 2: Identify similarities and differences between the questions. - Both questions revolve around the act of singing and vocal sensations. - However, they address different aspects: one focuses on physical sensations in the face, while the other focuses on vocal changes and ability to sing. Step 3: Conclude whether the questions are the same. Although both questions are related to singing, they are not asking the same thing. The first question is about whether it is normal to feel facial vibrations while singing, while the second question is about why the user's voice is changing and they are not able to sing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

( 1976 ) is a documentary film shot in the IMAX format . It follows the history of flight , from the first hot air balloons in the 19th century to 20th century manned space missions . It was created for performance at the National Air and Space Museum 's IMAX Theater in Washington , D.C.  - Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.  - The National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, also called the NASM, is a museum in Washington, D.C.. It holds the largest collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft in the world. It was established in 1946 as the National Air Museum and opened its main building on the National Mall near L'Enfant Plaza in 1976. In 2014, the museum saw approximately 6.7 million visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world. The museum contains the Apollo 11 module, the Friendship 7 which was flown by John Glenn, the Bell X-1 which broke the sound barrier, and the Wright brothers plane near the entrance.   - The National Mall is a national park in downtown Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Mall, which is part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. The term \\"National Mall\\" commonly includes areas that are officially part of West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument dividing the area slightly west of its midpoint. A smaller designation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mall proper\\", excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them. The National Mall contains a number of museums and memorials and receives approximately 24 million visitors each year.  - The Bell X-1 was a rocket engine-powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics-U.S. Army Air Forces-U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft. Conceived during 1944 and designed and built in 1945, it achieved a speed of nearly in 1948. A derivative of this same design, the Bell X-1A, having greater fuel capacity and hence longer rocket burning time, exceeded in 1954. The X-1, piloted by Chuck Yeager, was the first manned airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and was the first of the X-planes, a series of American experimental rocket planes (and non-rocket planes) designated for testing of new technologies and often kept secret.  - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.  - Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans, who were Americans, on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module \\"Eagle\\" on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module \\"Columbia\\" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with \\"Columbia\\" in lunar orbit.  - L'Enfant Plaza is a complex of four commercial buildings grouped around a large plaza in the Southwest section of Washington, D.C.. Immediately below the plaza and the buildings is the \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall. The plaza is located south of Independence Avenue SW between 12th and 9th Streets SW (9th Street actually runs underneath the centers of the buildings on the easternmost side of the plaza). It was built perpendicular to L'Enfant Promenade, a north-south running street and pedestrian esplanade part of which is directly above 10th Street SW. The plaza is named for Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, the architect and planner who first designed a street layout for the capital city. It was dedicated in 1968 after completion of the north and south buildings.  - Roman Kroitor (December 12, 1926  September 17, 2012) was a Canadian filmmaker who was known as an early practitioner of Cinéma vérité, as co-founder of IMAX, and as creator of the Sandde hand-drawn stereoscopic animation system. He was also the original inspiration for the Force, popularized in the \\"Star Wars\\" series.  - The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871  January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867  May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who are generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible.  - IMAX (an acronym for Image maximum) is a motion picture film format and a set of cinema projection standards developed in Canada by Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw. IMAX has the capacity to record and display images of far greater size and resolution than conventional film systems. Since 2002, some feature films have been converted (or upgraded) into IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres and some have also been partially shot in IMAX.  - The Smithsonian Institution, established in 1846 \\"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge,\\" is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States. Originally organized as the \\"United States National Museum,\\" that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967. Termed \\"the nation's attic\\" for its eclectic holdings of 138 million items, the Institution's nineteen museums, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia. Additional facilities are located in Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York City, Virginia, Texas, and Panama. More than 200 institutions and museums in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Panama are Smithsonian Affiliates The Institution's thirty million annual visitors are admitted without charge. The institution's annual budget is around 1.2 billion with 2/3 coming from annual federal appropriations. Other funding comes from the Institution's endowment, private and corporate contributions, membership dues, and earned retail, concession, and licensing revenue. Institution publications include \\"Smithsonian\\" and \\"Air & Space\\" magazines.  - A documentary film is a nonfictional motion picture intended to some aspect of reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record. Such films were originally shot on film stockthe only medium availablebut now include video and digital productions that can be either direct-to-video, made into a TV show, or released for screening in cinemas. \\"Documentary\\" has been described as a \\"filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception\\" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries.  - Direct-to-video or straight-to-video (also known as direct-to-VHS, direct-to-DVD, direct-to-Blu-ray, direct-to-digital, etc.) refers to the release of a film to the public immediately on home video formats rather than a theatrical release or television broadcast. Because inferior sequels or prequels of larger-budget films may be released direct to video, references to direct-to-video releases are often pejorative. Direct-to-video release has also become profitable for independent filmmakers and smaller companies.  - A film format is a technical definition of a set of standard characteristics regarding image capture on photographic film, for either stills or filmmaking. It can also apply to projected film, either slides or movies. The primary characteristic of a film format is its size and shape.  - Ivan Graeme Ferguson, CM (born 7 October 1929 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian filmmaker and inventor who co-invented IMAX. Ferguson was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1993. He graduated from the University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree.  - John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921  December 8, 2016) was a United States Marine Corps aviator, engineer, astronaut, and United States Senator from Ohio. In 1962 he was the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times. Before joining NASA, Glenn was a distinguished fighter pilot in World War II and Korea with six Distinguished Flying Crosses and eighteen clusters on his Air Medal.

In this sentence, \\"he\\" is the pronoun, while \\"Joe\\" and \\"the detective\\" are the nouns. Step 3: Determine the antecedent of the pronoun. To do this, we need to look at the context of the sentence for clues.  Step 4: Analyzing the sentence structure. The sentence states that Joe paid the detective after an event occurred (the event being \\"he delivered the final report on the case\\"). Given the context, it seems more likely that the detective would be the one delivering the final report, since it's their job to investigate and provide information on cases. Step 5: Conclude the antecedent.

See options at the end The walk in the gym was more comfortable than the walk in the woods because it was hotter in the  OPTIONS:  (a). woods ..  (b). gym ..","output":"The sentence ends with option (a). The complete sentence is: \\"The walk in the gym was more comfortable than the walk in the woods because it was hotter in the woods.\\" This sentence suggests that the individual found the walk in the gym to be a more pleasant experience in comparison to the walk in the woods, due to the higher temperature in the woods. The choice of the gym over the woods in this context highlights the speaker's preference for a cooler environment during physical activities. The gym likely had a controlled climate, such as air conditioning, while the woods were exposed to the outdoor elements, which may have been characterized by hot and humid weather on that particular day. Walking and engaging in other forms of physical activity within a controlled environment like a gym offers certain advantages over doing the same activities outdoors. In the context of this sentence, the climate-controlled nature of the gym provides an ideal setting for the speaker to avoid the challenges and discomfort associated with walking in hotter conditions in the woods. These challenges might include excessive sweating, potential dehydration, and overheating, which can result in symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. Furthermore, walking in the gym can often provide additional benefits, such as a flat and even surface, which minimizes the risk of tripping or slipping. On the other hand, walking in the woods may involve navigating uneven terrain, rocks, tree roots, and other obstacles. Although many people do enjoy the natural beauty of the outdoors while engaging in physical activities, the speaker in this situation is highlighting their preference for more comfortable conditions that directly impact their ability to walk in an enjoyable and safe manner. In conclusion, the sentence illustrates the speaker's preference for walking indoors in a cooler, climate-controlled gym environment rather than outdoors in the hot woods. Besides the controlled temperature, other factors that might have contributed to their choice include safer walking conditions and a more predictable environment. While engaging in physical activities outdoors can certainly offer its own set of benefits, the speaker's decision shows the importance they place on their personal comfort while engaging in physical activities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Upon receiving your test results, your doctor can advise you on appropriate treatment options or discuss potential preventative measures based on the underlying cause of your low iron levels. Some common causes of low iron levels include poor dietary intake, decreased iron absorption due to gastrointestinal issues, or chronic blood loss. Pregnant women, children, and people with certain medical conditions are also at increased risk for developing an iron deficiency. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods like red meat, poultry, fish, legumes, and fortified cereals. If your doctor confirms that your iron levels are low, they may recommend iron supplements or dietary changes to help increase your iron intake. Be sure to follow their advice, as taking too much iron can be harmful. Additionally, your doctor may suggest consuming foods rich in vitamin C, as it can enhance iron absorption in your body. Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider are crucial for monitoring your iron levels and making adjustments to your treatment plan as necessary. Do not hesitate to communicate any symptoms or concerns during your follow-up appointments, as this information can help your doctor optimize your care and address any complications that may arise.

Star Trek Beyond Will Feature Gay Hikaru Sulu When it premiered on NBC in 1966, Star Trek was revolutionary in its diversity. Featuring a Japanese-American helmsman (George Takei) and a female African-American communications officer (Nichelle Nichols) among its core characters, the show presented a multicultural vision of the future that was unprecedented in network television. But just as progressive as actually making the show diverse was its nonchalance about this vision, presented without scandal or fanfare. To the disappointment of many fans, the show’s inclusion did not extend to LGBT characters, even as it blossomed into a major franchise over half a century. That fact is set to change with the release of Star Trek Beyond on July 22, in which it has been revealed that Hikaru Sulu, played by Takei in the original series and by John Cho in the most recent big-screen trilogy, will be gay. Cho says the decision to reveal the sexual orientation of the character, who has never had any explicit romantic attachments (though his daughter was introduced in the 1994 film Star Trek Generations), was made by writer Simon Pegg and director Justin Lin. It is meant, in part, as a tribute to Takei, who came out as gay in 2005 and has since become an advocate for LGBT rights. In a way, revealing Sulu to be gay in Beyond is a continuation of the franchise’s treatment of diversity as a non-issue. As Cho told the Herald Sun, “I liked the approach, which was not to make a big thing out it, which is where I hope we are going as a species, to not politicise one’s personal orientations.” For many, the news is simultaneously welcome and alarmingly late, especially given the show’s progressive track record. The show was among the first to depict an interracial kiss, in the 1968 episode “Plato’s Stepchildren,” a decision which sparked a backlash, Takei has said, that made creator Gene Roddenberry fear that too much envelope-pushing could backfire and leave him without a show at all. This fear contributed to the lack of LGBT representation during Roddenberry’s tenure, though he had apparently been planning to add an LGBT character to Star Trek: The Next Generation before he died suddenly in 1991. It’s also possible that the idea that the series’ universe transcends race and sexuality may have created a situation in which addressing the issue felt unnecessary to its helmers. Roddenberry’s son Rod told Wired in 2013, though he conceded that it sounded a bit like a cop-out, “I mean, there were interspecies relationships on Star Trek, so we’re just beyond the point where homosexuality is an issue.” But as Devon Maloney wrote in that story, a thorough look at the franchise’s record with regard to LGBT representation, “The invisibility of gay characters isn’t neutral; it’s negative.” At a time when only 36 percent of studio movies pass the Vito Russo Test—a litmus test for whether LGBT characters are not only represented but presented as complex people rather than thin stereotypes—visibility is critical. The question now is not only how Sulu’s sexual orientation will play out in Star Trek Beyond, but whether this decision might also bode well for LGBT representation in the reboot of the Star Trek show airing on CBS All Access next year and produced by Rod Roddenberry. The treatment of sexuality in the series’ character development may well be a non-issue—as important as Sulu’s love for botany or fencing or his daughter—but the visibility of rich LGBT characters is an issue, and one worth monitoring closely. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the character Hikaru Sulu from Star Trek Beyond, who will be gay in the upcoming film set to release on July 22. This change in the character's representation comes as an effort to be more inclusive of the LGBTQ community within the Star Trek franchise. The article discusses the history of the franchise's treatment of diversity, its importance in bringing visibility to LGBTQ characters, and how the upcoming film may impact future character development in the series."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are expected to return whether the given profession's gender is identifiable or unidentifiable. Input: Sentence: The sheriff gave the secretary no more chances and arrested him.  Profession: sheriff Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the given sentence and profession. Usage: Sentence: \\"The sheriff gave the secretary no more chances and arrested him.\\"  Profession: sheriff Explanation: The given sentence is a text that mentions two professions and uses a gendered pronoun to identify one's gender. The profession provided is 'sheriff', which we have to determine the gender from the sentence. Part #2: Find gendered pronouns in the text. Usage: Gendered pronoun: \\"him\\" Explanation: In the sentence provided, we find the gendered pronoun 'him,' which refers to a male person. The presence of gendered pronouns helps to identify gender for one of the mentioned professions. Part #3: Determine the profession associated with gendered pronouns. Usage: The gendered pronoun is associated with the profession: secretary (male) Explanation: As the sentence says, \\"The sheriff gave the secretary no more chances and arrested him,\\" the pronoun 'him' refers to the secretary, suggesting that the secretary's gender is male. Part #4: Return whether the given profession's gender is identifiable or unidentifiable. Usage: The profession 'sheriff's gender is unidentifiable. Explanation: We determined that the gendered pronoun 'him' is associated with the profession 'secretary.' Since the given profession is 'sheriff,' its gender is not mentioned in the sentence, making it unidentifiable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front's [FMLN] urban commandos have denied reports that they participated in an attack on vice president-elect Francisco Merino's home. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? They denied reports according to the statement","output":"From the provided paragraph, we can infer that the statement \\"They denied reports according to the statement\\" is true. The paragraph clearly states that the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front's (FMLN) urban commandos have rejected or denied the reports claiming their participation in an attack on the home of Vice President-elect Francisco Merino. Furthermore, the information from the paragraph would suggest that FMLN's urban commandos wanted to distance their organization from any involvement in the alleged attack on the elected official's residence. This denial could come in the form of an official statement or a spokesperson for the group expressing their disapproval of such actions, which would be in line with the statement in question. Though the paragraph does not directly confirm the source of the statement (whether it is an official communique or verbal rebuttal from a spokesperson, for instance), it does emphasize that the FMLN's urban commandos have effectively denied any involvement in the mentioned attack. It is important to consider the context and reliability of the denial in terms of the sources providing this information. However, based on the given paragraph, we can deduce that the sentence \\"They denied reports according to the statement\\" accurately reflects the key message communicated by the FMLN's urban commandos."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and cooking. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions. Further, they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from harmful UV radiation.  There is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed, but some information has been inferred by studying lice. The body louse specifically lives in clothing, and diverge from head lice about 107,000 years ago, suggesting that clothing existed at that time. Another theory is that modern humans are the only survivors of several species of primates who may have worn clothes and that clothing may have been used as long ago as 650 thousand years ago. Other louse-based estimates put the introduction of clothing at around 42,000–72,000 BP. Answer this series of questions: 1. what does clothing do? 2. from what? 3. what does it protect from? 4. what else? 5. how does it protect from those things? 6. do other mammals today wear them? 7. how long have people had clothes? 8. how do we know that? 9. how do we know they've been around for many years? 10. can wearing it us safe from the sun?","output":"1. Clothing serves multiple purposes for humans. It primarily offers protection, insulation, and a hygiene barrier, shielding the body from various elements in the environment, materials, and conditions. 2. Clothing protects the body from elements like the sun, rain, wind, and snow.  3. It safeguards the skin from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns, and prickles, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and cooking. 4. In addition to protection, clothing also provides insulation against hot and cold conditions. This helps regulate the body's temperature and maintain comfort. 5. Clothing acts as a physical barrier between the skin and the environment. It is made of various materials like fabrics, fibers, and synthetics that create a shield from harm and maintain insulation. 6. Other mammals don't usually wear clothing; however, humans have developed pet clothing for additional protection, warmth, or fashion. Still, unlike humans, other mammals rely on their fur, feathers, or skin to protect them from different conditions. 7. It is challenging to determine the exact timeline of when humans started wearing clothes. Estimates based on studying lice propose that clothing may have been used between 42,000 to 107,000 years ago. 8. Research on lice, specifically the body louse, gives us insights into when clothing might have been first used. The body louse lives in clothing and is believed to have diverged from head lice around 107,000 years ago. This suggests that clothing likely existed at that time. 9. As mentioned earlier, louse-based estimates indicate that clothing existed between 42,000 and 107,000 years ago. The study of the evolution of lice and the divergence of body lice from head lice helps establish a timeline for the existence of clothing. 10. Yes, wearing clothing can protect the skin from the harmful rays of the sun. Clothes made from materials with ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) can shield our bodies from the sun's harmful UV radiation, reducing the risk of sunburn and skin damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay Â£500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon. Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay, evading Khan's bodyguard Gobinda's attempts to kill them both. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real FabergÃ© egg fitted with a listening device by Q, while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the FabergÃ© egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe. After escaping from Khan's palace, Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur, India, and there finds its owner, Octopussy, a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan.

Would \\"The Dutch economy was hit considerably by the ongoing global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crisis .\\" be a reasonable answer?  (1). No; (2). Yes; The answer is:","output":"(2). Yes; The Dutch economy was indeed hit considerably by the ongoing global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crisis, but this only gives a snapshot of the effects during that specific period. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the economics of the Netherlands, it is essential to consider the broader characteristics of its economy, as well as its performance in recent years. The Dutch economy is the 17th largest in the world in terms of GDP and is known for its stable and prosperous nature. It is a developed and highly diverse economy, with a strong focus on international trade, advanced technology, and a skilled workforce. In fact, the nation is one of the most competitive economies in the world, largely attributed to its advantageous geographic location and well-developed infrastructure. One of the most distinctive features of the Dutch economy is its reliance on international trade. Benefiting from its coastal location and advanced port facilities, particularly the Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands is one of the world's leading exporters and importers of goods and services. Major export goods include machinery, electronics, chemicals, fuels, food, and pharmaceutical products, while imports mainly consist of raw materials, consumer goods, and services. The key trading partners are Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and China. The Dutch economy is also characterized by a highly developed service sector, which constitutes around 70% of the GDP. Major industries within this sector include financial services, logistics, and tourism. Notably, many international companies choose to establish their European headquarters in the Netherlands due to the favorable tax and business environment. Moreover, the Dutch agricultural sector is highly productive and advanced. Despite the country's relatively small size, it is the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, after the United States. This can be attributed to advanced agricultural technology and a focus on high-value-added products such as fresh produce, dairy, meat, and flowers. The Dutch labor market is marked by its flexibility and high level of workforce participation. With a relatively low unemployment rate, the Netherlands prides itself on a well-qualified workforce, both in terms of education and skills development. Furthermore, the Dutch government plays an essential role in shaping the economy through its well-crafted fiscal policies, targeted spending, and efforts to create a conducive business environment. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis, the Dutch economy experienced a period of relatively slow growth and increased national debt. However, with the help of prudent fiscal policies, structural reforms, and a steady focus on fostering competitiveness and innovation, the country managed to recover in the subsequent years. Pre-pandemic data show the Dutch economy witnessing stable growth, with low unemployment and manageable fiscal balances. In summary, the statement that the Dutch economy was hit considerably by the ongoing global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crisis is accurate. However, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the economics of the Netherlands, it is important to consider its fundamental attributes like its international trade orientation, developed service sector, advanced agricultural output, well-qualified workforce, and the government's role in shaping the economy."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: To be an effective online teacher, you should consider taking an online teaching course, in addition to ensuring you have taken a regular teacher training program and are certified to teach in your state or area. Teaching online can be very different than teaching in a classroom, as you do not have the advantage of face to face interaction with your students and it may be difficult to create a connection with students online. You can better prepare for the challenges of teaching online by taking a class or program on how to teach students in an online class. The university where you completed your bachelor’s degree may offer a class in online teaching or you may consider enrolling in a teaching online program through another university or college. It can be difficult to develop a sense of community and connection with other educators, especially if you are working from home and do not have to go into a school setting every day. It can also be hard to network and meet potential job contacts if you work from home and are not exposed to a professional environment on a daily basis. You can expand your contacts in education by joining an online teaching association in your area. Associations like The World Association for Online Education (WAOE) can connect you to other online teachers and refer you to potential employers. Some online teaching associations may also offer access to online forums where you can chat with other online educators on a daily basis, ask questions about teaching online, and get references for open positions at online teaching programs. The beauty of online teaching is you do not need to focus your job search in one geographical area or an area close to where you live, as you will be working from your home office throughout the day. Instead, you can search online teaching programs at online universities for open positions that are applicable to your content area speciality. You can also look at universities and colleges who offer online courses in subject matter that relates to your content area, as you can then apply to teach the specific online class. Make sure your CV and cover letter are customized to the positions you are applying for, as this will show the employer that you took the time to read and understand the skills required for the position. Customizing your resume and cover letter will also improve your chances of getting hired.  If you are applying for a position teaching an online class in urban planning, for example, you may note on your resume that you have a bachelor’s degree in urban planning and have completed a practicum in a secondary level urban planning and design class as part of your bachelor’s degree. You may also want to include sample lesson plans as part of your job application to show that you can create effective lesson plans for a course. Make sure the lesson plans contain interactive activities and focus on keeping online students engaged in the online course. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to become a good online teacher.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who quietly takes a knife from the supper table while he is drafting the document?  Scarpia's apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening Scarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning.  He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace. She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything.  Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa. Scarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He's devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an upset on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be shot. Scarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: \\"Vissi d'arte\\" (\\"I lived for art\\"). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia isn't interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself. Spoletta returns with the news that Angelotti has killed himself upon discovery, and that everything is in place for Cavaradossi's execution. Scarpia...

The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks  coffee shops spread across the country. The first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle. Things really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did.

The passage cited is a translation of the original Hebrew text into English, with the specific formatting and style used to clearly identify the name of the Lord (Yahweh) and to convey the gravity of the words. In this verse, the Lord Yahweh is speaking through the prophet Ezekiel, communicating a message of judgment and punishment for the people who have turned away from Him and sinned. The verse emphasizes the severity of this divine retribution, detailing the various ways in which they will suffer and ultimately perish: by the sword, devoured by animals, or from pestilence (disease). The context of this verse is essential for understanding its meaning, as the Book of Ezekiel is centered on the themes of divine judgment, the fall of Jerusalem at the hands of Babylon, and the eventual restoration of the people of Israel. The entire book consists of revelations and prophecies given to Ezekiel by God, who shares these messages with the people in an attempt to lead them back to a path of righteousness. In summary, Ezekiel 33:27 is a pivotal verse showcasing the severity of divine judgment and consequences for those who disobey and turn away from the Lord Yahweh. By detailing the extreme suffering and death that will befall these individuals, the verse serves as a stark reminder of the importance of remaining faithful and obedient to God's will and commandments.

The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

He wanted the shopper to send the flowers to his mother, who lived two hundred miles away. As he got out of his car, he found a young girl sitting on the road crying.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Katie (Jenny McCarthy) and Becca (Pamela Anderson) are talking about a tape, which Katie believes is a sex tape, but Becca refers to a cursed tape (The Ring). After several odd occurrences, they both die. Meanwhile, in a farm outside Washington, D.C., widowed farmer Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) and his clumsy brother George (Simon Rex) discover a crop circle, saying \\"Attack Here!\\" (Signs).Meanwhile, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), now a blonde news reporter, announces the crop circles on the news. She then goes to pick up her paranormally endowed nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska) from school, where her best friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) is his teacher. George Logan arrives to pick up his niece Sue, who is in the same class. Cindy falls in love with George, who invites her and Brenda to a rap-battle that evening with his rapper friends Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) (8 Mile). George competes and proves to be actually quite talented, but due to unintentional racist blunders, he's thrown out.Later, Brenda asks Cindy to keep her company, since she watched the cursed videotape. After playing several pranks on Cindy (fake seizures, burning hand, etc.), she gets the rest of the popcorn in the lounge, when the TV turns on. Brenda fails to turn it off. Tabitha (Marny Eng) climbs out of the well and the TV, Brenda gets into a fight with Tabitha. Tabitha ends up killing Brenda, since Cindy is ignoring the ruckus. George receives a phone call about the death, and Tom meets with Sayaman, who apologizes for the accident involving himself and Tom's wife Annie (Denise Richards).During Brenda's wake, George and Mahalik, due to a misunderstanding, wreak havoc on Brenda's corpse in an unsuccessful attempt to revive her, only to blow up her body and end up getting kicked out of the house. Later, Cindy decides to watch the tape, finding it odd. She then gets a phone call, saying she'll die in a week. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help. CJ offers that his Aunt Shaneequa might be able to help. Aunt Shaneequa (Queen Latifah), the Matrix Oracle, and her husband Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) agree to watch the tape. Shaneequa discovers the hidden image of a lighthouse, and gets into a fight with Tabitha's mother. Shaneequa tells Cindy to find the lighthouse to break the curse. When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody watched the tape.Back at work, Cindy searches through pictures of lighthouses before finding the one from the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy tries to warn everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter, but she is interrupted by her boss and a janitor who insults the manager on the teleprompter (which the anchorman blindly recites). The Logans hear the message and take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson (Edward Moss), and President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen), who personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy ventures to the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect (George Carlin). The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistook the evil tape for a copy of Pootie Tang and returned it to Blockbuster instead, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.Returning home, Cindy discovers her station has been broadcasting the evil tape for hours, and there have been various sightings of aliens around the world. Worse, Cody is missing. Cindy manages to track him back to the Logan farm, where he has taken refuge with George. Tom orders everybody into the basement for safety, as he, George and Mahalik go outside to fight off the extraterrestrials. The aliens (voiced by Tom Kenny) arrive but reveal they are friendly and have come to stop Tabitha, since they accidentally watched the tape on a broadcast they had intercepted, thinking it was Pootie Tang.In the basement, Cindy realizes the farm's cellar is what is seen on the tape and she finds the well where Tabitha was drowned under the cellar floor. Suddenly, Tabitha appears behind her. A short fight ensues, during which Tabitha takes Cody hostage. Cindy and George appeal to her, offering her a place in their family. Tabitha appears to accept the offer, but then changes back to her monstrous form and advances to Cindy and the others, only to be accidentally knocked back into the well by President Harris. The aliens leave in peace, and Cindy and George get married. Leaving for their honeymoon, they realize they forget to take Cody with them. At first, Cody is about to get hit by Cindy's car in an intersection, but she put the brakes this time to prevent it from happening, much to Cody's relief. Unfortunately, causing Cody to be hit by another car passing through the intersection., Question: George invites Cindy and Brenda to what event?

Which nuclear waste repository near Las Vegas Valley is represented by children's cartoon character Yucca Mountain Johnny? A:","output":"A: Yucca Mountain Johnny is a children's cartoon character that represents the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, a proposed long-term storage facility for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, located near Las Vegas Valley in Nevada, United States. The creation of Yucca Mountain Johnny was an attempt to raise awareness and educate children about the importance of proper management and disposal of nuclear waste. The character is depicted as a friendly desert tortoise that lives in the Yucca Mountain area and is knowledgeable about nuclear waste storage. He often shares information with children and helps them understand the complexities associated with nuclear waste repositories and their significance. The Yucca Mountain repository has been a subject of debate and controversy for several years. The federal government and the U.S. Department of Energy initially selected the area in 1987 as the only site for consideration to store nuclear waste. However, concerns about potential environmental, health, and safety risks, as well as political disagreements and opposition from Nevada residents, have delayed the project. Critics argue that the facility could have adverse effects on the environment and local communities, especially considering its proximity to Las Vegas Valley. They point out the potential impact on groundwater, as well as the potential for accidents and natural disasters causing catastrophic leaks and releasing radioactive materials into the environment. Numerous legal challenges have also been filed over the years to either stop or delay the project. Supporters of the Yucca Mountain repository, on the other hand, emphasize the need for a safe and centralized long-term storage facility for nuclear waste. They argue that the lack of such a facility leads to temporary storing of high-level waste at nuclear plants across the country, potentially posing even greater risks to the environment and communities. They also claim that the facility's design incorporates cutting-edge technology and safety measures to protect the surroundings and comply with stringent regulatory requirements. In the context of Yucca Mountain Johnny, the character serves as an educational tool that simplifies a complex issue for a younger audience and provides an engaging way to teach children about nuclear waste and its responsible management. However, some may argue that anthropomorphizing such a contentious subject could downplay the seriousness of the risks associated with nuclear waste storage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The given text has been transformed into lowercase, which is a common method for making the text appear more casual or less formal. Using lowercase letters can sometimes provide a more accessible or informal style for informal communication, like text messaging or social media posts. In this particular text, the message seems to convey the importance of faith in one's life and how turning back from that faith would be displeasing. By presenting this message in lowercase letters, it might appear more approachable or relatable to some readers, as they may relate to the more casual tone.  However, it is essential to consider the context in which the text will be used, as some situations may call for more formal language. In formal writing, it is usually more appropriate to use capitalization and punctuation correctly to avoid conveying an unprofessional or less respectful tone. Despite the transformation in the case of the text, the meaning remains unchanged. The text still emphasizes the significance of being steadfast in one's faith and the consequences of giving up on that faith. This could serve as a reminder or a form of motivation for some individuals to remain committed to their beliefs, regardless of the challenges they might face.

When people feel sad, they often have the feeling of needing to be heard. So, listen carefully to what she is saying and do nothing else. Your friend will surely thank you for being the shoulder she can cry on.    Once you are done with listening, you can offer some advice or remain silent and let her feel everything and let it all out by crying. As a friend, you might think you should give her some advice.

Steven regretted going camping with Ian because there were frogs all over the campsite, so","output":"he decided to devise a plan to avoid them as much as possible. The first step in his plan was to conduct some research on the local frog species in order to better understand their habits and habitats. He pulled out his smartphone and searched for information about frogs in the area. This way, he thought, he could find out their active times and preferred locations, allowing him and Ian to adjust their camping activities accordingly. Once he'd gathered sufficient information, Steven shared his findings with Ian. They discovered that the frogs were most active at night and typically stayed close to the water's edge. With this knowledge, they decided to move their campsite further away from the water and would avoid walking near the shoreline during the evening hours. This would minimize their encounters with the frogs and make the camping experience more enjoyable for Steven. In addition to relocating their campsite, Steven and Ian also put into practice some preventive measures. They decided to use insect-repellent spray on their clothes and skin, as the frogs were attracted to insects lingering around the campsite. This would help to reduce the frog population near the campsite, since their food source would be diminished. Furthermore, they agreed to always wear shoes when walking around the campsite at night, in case they accidentally stepped on any frogs. This would protect both themselves and the frogs from potential harm. Lastly, they decided to make a small campfire each evening, as the light and heat would deter the frogs from coming too close to their campsite. By incorporating all these strategies, Steven felt more at ease about the situation and began to enjoy the camping trip with Ian. As the days went on, Steven started to develop a newfound appreciation for the frogs and their place in the ecosystem. Despite his initial fears and discomfort, he eventually gained a sense of respect for these creatures and understood the importance of coexisting with them in their natural habitat. Ultimately, though Steven's camping experience with Ian began with regret, it ended up being a valuable lesson in adaptability, understanding, and respect for nature. In time, Steven would even come to enthusiastically share this story with friends and family, recounting how his encounter with the frogs taught him to embrace and appreciate the diverse wildlife that inhabits our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This casual outfit made him feel comfortable and ready to face the challenges that lay ahead in the day. As he glanced down at his clean attire, he couldn't help but chuckle at the memory of the embarrassing fall he had taken earlier on the muddy path. Frank was heading to the city park for the annual Arts & Crafts Festival, a much-anticipated event in his small town. Local artisans and creatives came together to showcase their best work - from pottery and paintings to jewelry and homemade clothing. He was proud to be a part of this vibrant community and looked forward to supporting their crafts every year. He grabbed his wallet, phone, and a reusable tote, and set off for the park. The summer sun felt warm upon his skin, and there was a gentle, refreshing breeze that made the leaves in the trees rustle. As he walked, he could hear the excited chatter and laughter of other festival-goers in the near distance, further increasing his anticipation. Upon arriving at the park, Frank was greeted by a colorful array of tents and booths, each showcasing a unique piece of art or a sample of a craft. He took a leisurely stroll down the first row, pausing occasionally to examine some of the intricately-made pottery and wooden sculptures. As an amateur artist himself, he couldn't help but appreciate the handmade signs the vendors used to relay their names and the type of art they specialized in. A vibrant paisley scarf at one of the vendors caught Frank's eye. It reminded him of a similar scarf his mother used to wear when he was a child. Nostalgic feelings filled him, and he decided to buy the scarf to remind him of those simpler times. Furthermore, the vivid colors of the scarf just happened to match his capris. As Frank approached a booth filled with unique jewelry designs, a charming pair of earrings with various shades of blue caught his attention. They would make the perfect gift for his sister's upcoming birthday. As he paid for the earrings, he couldn't help but engage in a brief conversation with the artist, learning more about the stories and techniques behind her beautiful work. Frank's next stop was a tent filled with abstract paintings. The unconventional perspectives and the use of vibrant colors stirred up an immediate sense of awe within him. He couldn't resist the urge to purchase a smaller piece that complements his living room decor. As the day progressed, Frank continued to explore the festival, chatting with vendors and other art enthusiasts along the way. Every booth had a unique story, and he found great joy in learning the journey behind each artist's creations. He sampled homemade jams and relished a delicious lemonade made with fresh lemons, which he savored in the afternoon heat. Finally, in the evening, the sun began to set, casting an orange glow across the park filled with happy artisans and art lovers. With a sense of contentment, Frank realized that not only had he supported the local artists in his community, but he had also shared memories and forged new connections. His once-empty reusable tote was now filled with delightful treasures, each having a story to tell about his day at the Art & Crafts Festival. And although the day had started with a muddy mishap that resulted in donning a pair of capris, Frank couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected turn of events. For it was these capris and the day spent at the festival that had sparked a newfound love for the immense talent within his community, the beautiful diversity of art, and the many wonderful stories that connected them all."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For theories at the level of reverse-order arithmetic, the second mathematics program has much to say. This sentence is discussing \\"reverse-order arithmetic\\" and a \\"second mathematics program.\\" The main focus is on theories relating to reverse-order arithmetic, which seems to refer to a method of performing arithmetic operations in the opposite order than usual or to a particular set of mathematical rules or concepts. However, without additional context, it's unclear what precisely \\"reverse-order arithmetic\\" entails. The sentence states that a \\"second mathematics program,\\" potentially a different program or approach, has relevant insights or contributions to these theories. The focus here is on the interaction between this program and the concepts of reverse-order arithmetic. 2. For theories at the level of second-order arithmetic, the program for reverse mathematics has much to say. This sentence is discussing \\"second-order arithmetic\\" and a \\"program for reverse mathematics.\\" Here, the main focus is on theories that come into play at the level of second-order arithmetic. Second-order arithmetic is a formal system in mathematical logic which is a conservative extension of first-order arithmetic. It extends first-order arithmetic by allowing quantification over sets of natural numbers in addition to individual natural numbers. The program for \\"reverse mathematics\\" mentioned in the sentence is a research program that aims to determine the minimal set of axioms needed to prove particular theorems in mathematics. Reverse mathematics is an area within mathematical logic that seeks to understand the axiomatic foundations of mathematical theories by working backwards from the theorems to deduce the relevant axioms. In this sentence, the emphasis is on how the reverse mathematics program can contribute to the understanding or development of theories at the level of second-order arithmetic. In summary, the first sentence is about theories of reverse-order arithmetic and their relation to a second mathematics program, whereas the second sentence is about theories at the level of second-order arithmetic and their relation to a reverse mathematics program. Although both sentences discuss the intersections of mathematical theories and programs, they are focusing on different subjects and are therefore not equivalent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Spy: 8,000 hidden cameras like this one photograph the cars on Britain's roads 26 million times every day. Police are recording 26million images of motorists every day – an increase of 61 per cent since 2012, it emerged yesterday. Senior officers say the system is invaluable in preventing and solving serious crime and terror attacks. But civil liberty campaigners warn that it is intrusive and lacks oversight. The images are taken on a network of around 8,000 automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the UK. In 2012, 16million images were recorded every day by cameras – many of them unmarked – which are positioned on motorways and A and B roads. Each time a vehicle passes, a camera takes a picture of the vehicle’s numberplate and another of the front of the car, including the driver’s face. The cameras are operated by individual police forces but the records are stored  on a national database of 17 billion  images, used by police and intelligence services to track criminals. However, it  also contains the records of innocent motorists, showing a detailed map of their daily journeys. Police refuse to reveal the locations of the cameras, saying to do so would undermine the effectiveness of the system. It is thought that by 2018, between 50 million and 75 million pictures of vehicles will be taken every day. The network of cameras is already so extensive that it allows police forces to track where vehicles have gone every single day. Pictures can be checked against the Police National Computer and used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in the battle against crime. The first cameras were installed in Britain on the M1 in 1984 to spot stolen vehicles. By 2005, the number of cameras had increased to 2,000 and there are now more than 8,000. As well as fixed cameras, police forces use mobile units - with more than 100 in London alone. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said the technology is being secretly rolled out without the public's knowledge. 'ANPR is a classic example of a very intrusive technology being rolled out with zero public debate. Tracked: The Government archive of 17 billion images works out as nearly 500 pictures of every one of the 36 million cars on Britain's roads. 'The public hasn't been given even the most basic information about what information is being recorded, how long it is kept or who is able to access it. 'When you consider the system allows every journey to be tracked, down to the second, and for someone to search through the entire log of when your car was scanned and where, it is without doubt an extremely intrusive system. 'How many people would have said yes if they had been asked to install a device on their car so the police could monitor their journeys? Yet this is exactly what ANPR technology allows. Secret camera: More Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras are expected to be rolled out over the next five years. 'It is a total failure of law and oversight if this massive yet secretive expansion of ANPR systems is legal.' Julian Blazeby, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'Given the nature of ANPR it is understandable that some will be concerned about how this data is used. 'ANPR has only ever been for the prevention and detection of crime as well as locating vulnerable people with the intent of preserving life. 'It has saved lives, brought serious, violent offenders to justice and is used in the detection of would-be terrorists. It’s not about tracking every vehicle’s journey – which is an exaggeration of ANPR’s capabilities. 'Currently we have an average of 7,750 active cameras within any seven day period and an average daily read of 26 million. 'However an increase to 50 or 75 million is not anticipated at this time and there are no current plans for a mass roll out of ANPR cameras. 'The database consists of approximately 17 billion records. This data is owned by the chief officers of law enforcement agencies who act as data controllers.' Police forces want to share the information harvested by the cameras with countries across Europe. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'ANPR is a vital tool and we support its use where it is legitimate and proportionate. 'We have created a new, independent post of surveillance camera commissioner to help oversee this. 'These cameras may only be located where there is an identified need to detect, deter, and disrupt criminality. Any new ANPR camera deployment will also require a privacy impact assessment.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article include: 1. Police are recording 26 million images of motorists every day, an increase of 61% since 2012. The images are taken on a network of around 8,000 automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras across the UK. In 2012, 16 million images were recorded every day. 2. Senior officers argue that the system is invaluable for preventing and solving serious crimes and terror attacks, while civil liberty campaigners warn that it is intrusive and lacks oversight. 3. The ANPR cameras capture a picture of the vehicle's number plate and another of the front of the car, including the driver's face. The records are stored on a national database of 17 billion images, used by police and intelligence services to track criminals. However, the database also contains records of innocent motorists, revealing a detailed map of their daily journeys. 4. Police refuse to reveal the locations of the cameras, stating that doing so would undermine the effectiveness of the system. By 2018, it was projected that between 50 million and 75 million pictures of vehicles would be taken every day. 5. The first ANPR cameras were installed in Britain on the M1 in 1984 to spot stolen vehicles. The number of cameras has grown significantly since, with over 8,000 cameras installed across the nation as of 2014. 6. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, expressed his concerns about the lack of public debate and transparency surrounding the technology. 7. Julian Blazeby, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, defended the use of ANPR, emphasizing its role in crime prevention, detection, and saving lives. 8. The Home Office supports the use of ANPR as a vital tool, as long as it is legitimate and proportionate. They have also created a new post of surveillance camera commissioner to help oversee the system. These key points provide an overview of the article, highlighting the increasing use of ANPR cameras in the UK, the debates surrounding their effectiveness and privacy concerns, and the differing viewpoints on their role in crime prevention and detection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: Background: Various kinds of commercial molecular systems have been developed for fast and more accurate detection of respiratory viruses. Anyplex TM II RV16 [RV16] was designed for simultaneous detection of 16 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR coupled with TOCE TM technology. Objectives: To compare the performance of RV16 with those of culture and Seeplex ® RV15 ACE [RV15] by determining their sensitivity and specificity. Study design: Seven hundred and thirty respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV16, and RV15. For molecular tests, automated nucleic acid extraction and liquid handling system using MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, USA) was adopted to maximize the workflow and accuracy. Performance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard. Results: Two hundred and one samples (28%) out of 730 samples were positive by culture, while additional 281 (39%) were positive by RV16 or RV15. Sensitivities of RV16, RV15, and culture for virus tested were as follows: 100/93/63% for influenza A, 90/80/69% for influenza B, 98/94/63% for RSV, 98/52/23% for adenovirus, and 100/75/46% for PIV. For viruses not covered by culture, sensitivities of RV16 and RV15 were as follows: 99/81% for rhinovirus, 92/100% for coronavirus OC43, 100/56% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 92/88% for metapneumovirus, 100/62% for bocavirus, and 91/91% for enterovirus. Overall, the specificities of culture, RV16, and RV15 (Seegene) were 100/99.9/99.9%. Conclusions: RV16 assay was superior to culture method and RV15 and will be a promising tool for patient management and public health epidemiology.

Here's a short story: A snail and hummingbird both travelled a mile; did the (A) hummingbird take longer because it took more time to take the trip/ (B) snail.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"hummingbird\\" and  \\"snail\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"hummingbird\\" and \\"snail\\" is \\"snail.\\"  To better understand this, let's discuss the characteristics of each creature and how they relate to their travel speeds. Snails are known for their slow movement, and they rely on their muscular foot to slowly slide across surfaces. The common garden snail, for instance, has an average speed of around 0.03 mph, which makes them one of the slowest moving creatures on Earth. When traveling a distance of one mile, a snail would take approximately 33 hours to complete the journey (assuming it could maintain a consistent pace and direction without stopping to rest, eat, or hide inside its shell). Hummingbirds, on the other hand, are among the fastest and most agile birds in the world, with some species capable of reaching speeds of up to 30 to 45 mph during their impressive aerial feats. A hummingbird's flight muscles make up about 30% of their body weight, which allows them to rapidly beat their wings to hover, fly forwards, backwards, and even upside down. When covering a one-mile distance, a hummingbird could complete the trip in around 1-2 minutes, provided that it is flying at a consistent speed and in a straight line. Considering the vastly different travel speeds of a snail and a hummingbird, it is clear that a snail would take much longer to travel a mile in comparison to a hummingbird. Both creatures exhibit their own unique adaptations that suit them for their respective habitats, but when it comes to speed and agility, a hummingbird has the clear advantage. Therefore, the most sensical answer to the question of which creature takes longer to travel a mile would be the snail, given its slow pace and limited mobility in comparison to the swift and agile hummingbird."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \\"I want to go to college.

Write some highlights for the following article: Only one percentage points separates Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst in the race to represent Iowa in the U.S. Senate. If the election were held today, 49% of likely Iowa voters say they would vote for Braley and 48% say they would support Ernst, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. That means the contentious race is within the survey's overall sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The electorate is far from solidified. Twenty percent of likely voters polled in Iowa said they could change their mind before Election Day in November. The Braley-Ernst race has been one of the most closely watched of the election year. With longtime Sen. Tom Harkin retiring, Democrats are fighting to keep the seat in blue hands and hope that a win in Iowa will keep the Senate in Democratic control. Republicans have other ideas, however, and hope that Ernst -- currently a state senator and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard -- will be able to flip the seat. With a little less than two months until Election Day, the race has already seen millions of dollars spent. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the two candidates had spent almost 6 million as of July. That figure doesn't include the millions that outside Republican and Democratic groups have spent on the race, either. Even with all the money spent, some likely voters are still unaware of each candidate. Six percent of likely Iowa voters are unfamiliar with Ernst, while 9% of voters say they are unfamiliar with Braley. Partisanship appears to trump identity politics in the race, too. Most women are supporting Braley, the Democratic man, while most men are supporting Ernst, the Republican woman. The two candidates are basically flipped with likely male and female voters: Braley is winning 41% of men and 57% of women, while Ernst is winning 56% of men and 41% of women. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted September 8-10, with 1,013 Iowa adults -- 608 likely voters -- questioned by telephone. Highlights:","output":"1. Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst are very close in the race to represent Iowa in the U.S. Senate. If the election were today, Braley would get 49% of the vote and Ernst would get 48%.     2. It's like a very close game where one team has a tiny lead, but it's so close that it could easily change. And 20% of voters say they may still change their minds before Election Day.     3. This is a very important race because the Democrats are trying to keep their team's hold on the seat since Senator Tom Harkin is retiring. And the Republicans are hoping their candidate, Joni Ernst, will turn the tide and help them win.     4. The race has already seen a lot of money being spent. Imagine you put all your allowance savings and more to buy a toy that you really want. That's how both sides are running this race. They have spent up to 6 million on it as of July!     5. And yet, some people don't know who the candidates are. It's like going to a birthday party and not knowing who the birthday boy or girl is.    6. Most women seem to be cheering for the Democrat, Bruce Braley, and most men are rooting for the Republican, Joni Ernst.     7. The poll was done by asking 608 likely voters over the phone.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas? from the following article ?  Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted... The answer is:","output":"Massenet. The last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas is Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet. He was a French composer of the Romantic era and is best known for his operas, such as Manon and Werther."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choices:  - bacteria  - ribosomes  - chromatids  - dna  A: A:","output":"Double strands of DNA wrap around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which are coiled into a chromatin fiber. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic material responsible for storing and transmitting all the biological information needed to build and maintain living organisms. It is composed of two complementary strands that are coiled together to form a double helix. Each strand is made up of nucleotides, which include a phosphate group, a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), and one of four types of nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine). Histone proteins are small, positively charged proteins that play a crucial role in the packaging of DNA within the nucleus of the cell. They help manage and organize the long strands of DNA, so they fit within the confined nuclear space. There are five main types of histones: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Together they form the core of the nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the basic units of DNA packaging within the nucleus. Each nucleosome consists of a core particle, which is an octamer (eight units) of histone proteins, including two copies each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. About 147 base pairs of DNA wrap around this histone core, making around 1.7 turns. The H1 histone acts as a linker, binding to both the DNA and the core particle, and stabilizing the structure. The formed nucleosomes are subsequently organized into a linear array known as a beaded string, which is held together by linker DNA. This string is then wrapped and coiled into higher order structures, ultimately forming a chromatin fiber. Chromatin fibers are further coiled and condensed to form chromosomes during cell division. Chromatin fibers enable efficient packaging of DNA within the cell nucleus and the proper regulation of gene expression. By organizing DNA into these distinct, tightly packed units, cells can efficiently control which regions of DNA are accessible or inaccessible to the cellular machinery responsible for replication, transcription, and repair of DNA."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: You may think your bathroom is often full of bacteria  and so you give it a complete cleaning once a week. But how often do you clean out and disinfect  your fridge? Well, probably not often enough, according to a recent study, which found out that the fridge is the second dirtiest place in your house, just behind the bathroom. Fridge temperatures were often set too high, allowing the growth of bacteria, which included E.coil, Enterobacteria, and S. aureus, all of which will give you an easy access to food poisoning. So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don\`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding  ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods. Finally, use common sense, and throw away old food.

Context: Coming off their win over the Titans, the Broncos remained on home ground for an AFC West rematch with the San Diego Chargers on Thursday Night Football. A 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Andre Caldwell gave the Broncos the early lead. The Chargers subsequently got on the board, with a 38-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak. The Broncos answered, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Chargers would score 21 unanswered points and dominate the time of possession, as the Broncos' offense went three-and-out on all three of their second quarter possessions. A 19-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Philip Rivers to wide receiver Keenan Allen tied the game, and the Chargers grabbed the lead late in the first half, with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to Allen. The Chargers took the opening possession of the second half and increased their lead, culminating with running back Ryan Mathews rushing for a 23-yard touchdown. The Broncos were forced to punt after only four plays on their initial possession of the second half, and the Chargers' ball control offense subsequently ate up over eight minutes of the third quarter, though the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt. The Broncos cut into the Chargers' lead in the fourth quarter, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Caldwell with 10:30 remaining in the game. After forcing a Chargers' punt, the Broncos offense got the football with 5:50 remaining, however, three plays later, Manning was intercepted by Chargers' linebacker Thomas Keiser at the Broncos' 39-yard line. Six plays later, a 35-yard field goal by Novak increased the Chargers' lead to 27-17 with 2:41 remaining. With no timeouts remaining (save the two-minute warning), the Broncos tried to rally, with Prater kicking a 42-yard field goal with only 34 seconds remaining. However, the Broncos' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Chargers. With the loss, the Broncos had their 13-game regular-season home winning streak snapped, as well as their 10-game winning streak against division opponents.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Last week, the French government nationalised the STX France shipyard at Saint-Nazaire on the Atlantic coast to prevent a majority stake being taken by an Italian company. The French government said it was seeking to defend France's strategic interests by retaining a 50% stake. The French finance minister will resume talks on the deal in Rome on Tuesday. The shipyard is the only one in France big enough to build aircraft carriers, and it also builds other large warships and cruise ships. The world's biggest cruise ship, Harmony of the Seas, was built there. It was put up for sale after its biggest shareholder, the South Korean conglomerate STX, collapsed last year. The French government owned the remainder of the shares in the shipyard. Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri and another Italian investor subsequently reached an agreement to buy a majority stake in the shipyard. However, last week Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced that France had exercised a \\"pre-emption\\" right to buy back the stake from the Italians. He said the reason was to protect France's strategic interests in matters of naval construction. France proposed a 50-50 ownership deal with Italian state-owned Fincantieri, but the company rejected the idea. However, Mr Le Maire said the proposition, which would allow France's strategic interests to be preserved, remained on the table. He said he would travel to Rome on Tuesday to discuss it with Italian government ministers. In a statement, Mr Le Maire said the decision to nationalise the Saint-Nazaire shipyard was only temporary. However, the move gave France time to negotiate the \\"best conditions possible\\" for the participation of Fincantieri in the shipyard, he added. Italy has hit back against the French decision to prevent Fincantieri taking a majority stake.

Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant.

Article: Rap mogul Marion \\"Suge\\" Knight and comedian Micah \\"Katt\\" Williams were arrested Wednesday for stealing a paparazzo's camera outside a Beverly Hills studio last month, authorities said.      Knight and Williams are charged with one count each of robbery.      The two men are suspected of stealing the camera of independent celebrity photographer Leslie Redden on Sept. 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills.      Police say Knight \\"orchestrated\\" the robbery in an alley off North Canon Drive.      \\"It was a strong arm robbery where a camera was forcefully removed from the photographer by Katt Williams. The victim in the matter did sustain injury in this case,\\" Beverly Hills Police Lt. Lincoln Hoshino said.      Williams was arrested Wednesday morning after he arrived at an Inglewood court for arraignment in a separate assault case.      Knight, who was staying at a property off the Las Vegas Strip, was taken into custody on Wednesday by a task force of local police and the FBI, according to a statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.      Las Vegas authorities made the arrest after they were advised by Beverly Hills police that a felony warrant for robbery had been issued for Knight.      He was booked at the Clark County Detention Center on warrants for being fugitive and driving on a suspended license, Las Vegas police said.      \\"Mr. Knight was unaware that there was any warrant,\\" said Richard Schonfeld, Knight's attorney. \\"We will be addressing the circumstances in court.\\"      If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison. Williams faces up to seven years in custody.      \\"Mr. Knight is kind of a magnet for trouble over time. Assault with a deadly weapon in his past, he’s a fugitive from justice, driving on a suspended license,\\" NBC4 legal analyst Royal Oakes said. \\"As a result, if convicted of stealing a camera, he could go to prison for 30 years.\\"      Oakes believes Knight and Williams' defense teams may also have a case.      “I would say this is a horrible misunderstanding. These paparazzo folks can be abusive and you can’t blame him for lashing out and trying to take the camera,\\" Oakes said.      Knight, the former head of Death Row Records, was most recently made the news in August when he was one of three people wounded during an early morning shooting at a West Hollywood nightclub.      Williams is free on 75,000 bail. Knight is in Las Vegas awaiting extradition and considered a fugitive for crossing state lines. His bail is set at 1 million. ||||| It was not the first time the Death Row Records founder was injured in a shooting. In 2005, he was shot during another pre-awards party in Miami.

Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to... The answer is:","output":"Bedřich Smetana"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Released on October 10, 1966, the single was an immediate critical and commercial hit, topping record charts in several countries including the US and UK. Characterized by its complex soundscapes, episodic structure, and subversions of pop music formula, it was the costliest single ever recorded at the time of its release. \\"Good Vibrations\\" later became widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music. The song has been covered by artists such as Groove Holmes, the Troggs, Charlie McCoy, and Psychic TV. John Bush commented: \\"'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its fragmented style made it essentially cover-proof.\\" In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: \\"Oh, he did a marvelous job, he did a great job. I was very proud of his version.\\" Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: \\"I used to like the sound of the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting--like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [the song] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much. Radio had become so formatted and so structured that that whole experience was already gone.\\"  In 2004, Wilson re-recorded the song as a solo artist for his album Brian Wilson Presents Smile. It was sequenced as the album's closing track, following \\"In Blue Hawaii\\". In this version, \\"Good Vibrations\\" was the project's only track that eschewed the modular recording method. The song's verses and chorus were recorded as part of one whole take, and were not spliced together.  In 2012, Wilson Phillips, a trio consisting of Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, and John Phillips' daughter Chynna, released an album containing covers of songs by the Beach Boys and the Mamas & the Papas titled Dedicated.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - If anyone had any doubts how Pope Francis feels about people who always complain, the answer is now tacked to the door of his frugal suite in a Vatican residence: “No Whining”.      A placard reading, \\"No Whining\\" is seen on Pope Francis' room door in this undated picture posted on the Vatican Insider website. Under the explicit warning, the red-and-white Italian language sing goes on to say that \\"violators are subject to a syndrome of always feeling like a victim and consequent reduction of your sense of humour and capacity to solve problems\\". REUTERS/courtesy Vatican Insider-La Stampa      Under the explicit warning, the red-and-white Italian language sign goes on to say that “violators are subject to a syndrome of always feeling like a victim and the consequent reduction of your sense of humor and capacity to solve problems”.      A picture of the sign was posted on the Vatican Insider website and its presence on the pope’s door confirmed to Reuters by its editor-in-chief Andrea Tornielli, an author who is close to Francis and has interviewed him several times.      The sign is adorned with the international symbol for ‘no’ - a backslash in a circle.      It adds: “The penalty is doubled if the violation take place in the presence of children. To get the best out of yourself, concentrate on your potential and not on your limitations.”      Then the closing zinger: “Stop complaining and take steps to improve your life”.      The sign was given to the pope recently by Italian psychologist and self-help author Salvo Noe. Francis promised Noe he would put it up in his office for a laugh.      Francis has had no shortage of complainers in the Vatican and in the Church since his election in 2013. He has tried to steer the 1.2 billion-member Church on a more inclusive and merciful path, angering conservatives who say he his sowing doctrinal confusion.      One recent episode involved German Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, a German whom the pope removed last month from his post as Vatican doctrinal chief at the end of a five-year term.      Mueller, who disagrees with the pope on a number of issues, apparently expected his mandate to be renewed automatically.      Mueller later told a German newspaper that the way he was treated was “unacceptable”. ||||| Whingers, whiners and moaners have been put on notice by none other than Pope Francis, who has stuck a big sign to the front door of his Vatican apartment that reads: “Complaining is forbidden”.      The notice, in large white letters on a red background, appeared in recent days on the door that leads to the pontiff’s private rooms in Casa Santa Marta, the modest residence where he lives in the shadow of St Peter’s Basilica.      The good-humoured notice appears to be aimed at cardinals, priests and members of his staff who may be more inclined to bring problems than solutions to the leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics.      Unlike his predecessors, who traditionally fled the torrid summer heat of Rome for the cooler environs of Castel Gandolfo, a papal residence in the Alban Hills outside the capital, Pope Francis eschews holidays and resolutely works through July and August.      The sign says that “offenders are subject to a syndrome of victimhood that reduces their sense of humour and capacity to solve problems.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Pope Francis has placed a sign on his door at his home in Vatican City that says \\"No Whining\\".

It says anyone who complains in front of kids will be in even more trouble, and it tells people to focus on their good parts not just their bad parts. It also says to stop complaining and make your life better. Pope Francis put the sign up as a joke after an Italian writer gave it to him.

Here's the basic breakdown:  Wavy hair (type 2), generally thin and easy to handle Curly hair (type 3) Coily hair (type 4), usually very fragile and hard to grow out Washing hair too often strips it of natural oils. Try washing it once a week. Switch to once every two or three weeks if your hair starts to break easily.  Try to find a shampoo that doesn't leave your hair feeling too dry. To reduce damage, wash hair in lukewarm water and rinse in cool water. The heat from blow drying can cause damage, leading your hair to break before it grows to the desired length. Instead, plait your hair, wrap it in a silk scarf, and let dry overnight. Alternatively, towel dry your hair by wrapping it in a towel and simply rubbing your head for a while. Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils. Restore these with conditioner suited for African hair. Periodically deep condition your hair as well. You can use leave-in conditioner in between washes. Rub natural oil into the middle and ends of your hair to make it soft and supple. This will help prevent it breaking before it grows too long. Jamaican oil, castor oil, Moroccan oil, or lavender oil are all good options. Covering your hair with a satin scarf can help your hair take in the oil. Water strengthens dry hair and may stimulate your hair roots. You can apply water, moisturizing conditioner, or a mixture of half olive oil or half coconut oil. For extra moisture, apply each one, in that order. The oil will help seal in the moisture. If you use gel or mousse in your hairstyle, try hair jam instead. This will hold your hair, then eventually melt into oils to add shine and moisture. These can strengthen some types of hair, but may damage dry hair. Try brushing your hair: if your strands stretch significantly before breaking, you may need more protein. Do not leave in protein conditioner longer than instructed on the label, or it may turn hard and brittle. About every other day or when your scalp feels dry, apply coconut grease to the tip of your pointer finger. Apply at the top of your part and sweep back until all the grease has been applied.  Stop if you notice dandruff, as oil can feed the fungus that causes it. If you have a perm, grease only once a week, or apply hot oil instead. Once a month, use a neutralizing shampoo to clean all products out of your hair. If you use a lot of sprays, gels, and other styling products, use it every other week.","output":"To maintain healthy hair, it is essential to understand its characteristics and choose the appropriate products and treatments.

The group of friends made the discovery on Saturday afternoon. The body was lying face-down in a hole at the edge of the garden, partially covered by trees.      They had rented the house in Palaiseau, ten miles south of Paris, for a weekend getaway to celebrate a 25th birthday. The seven-bedroom home was described in its Airbnb listing as a renovated 19th-century building with a swimming pool and a \\"lovely forest with a jogging trail\\" at the rear. It was at the edge of this woodland that they discovered the corpse, said to be in an advanced state of decomposition. The listing has now been removed from the website.      Police say the body is that of a woman aged between 30 and 50, clothed but with bare feet, and that the corpse could have been in the garden for several weeks. A source told Le Parisien that investigators suspect foul play.      Airbnb has come under fire previously for its marketplace model, which allows holidaymakers and property owners to bypass the traditional booking model. Critics say it allows renters to essentially operate as a business while skirting the insurance requirements and health and safety rules imposed on licensed hotels, leaving both owners and guests vulnerable.      Last year, the family of a man killed when a rope swing broke at an Airbnb rental property in Texas tried to raise awareness about the lack of inspections to ensure listed properties meet safety regulations or fire codes.      An Airbnb spokesman told the Huffington Post that hosts were expected to follow local rules and regulations and that the company issues a long list of advisory safety precautions. \\"Nothing is more important to us than safety,\\" he said. ||||| PARIS (AP) — French authorities are investigating the death of a woman whose decomposing body was found in the garden of an Airbnb rental in suburban Paris.      Bertrand Daillie, the deputy prosecutor for Evry, said a group of young people who were renting the house for a weekend discovered the badly decomposed body in the garden near the edge of the property. He says it was covered by tree branches that had been placed there deliberately.      Daillie told France Bleu radio the renters were to be questioned but had only rented the house for that weekend. According to Le Parisien newspaper, the listing was removed Sunday from Airbnb. ||||| A group of friends who rented a house via Airbnb in the Paris suburbs to hold a weekend party had their plans brought to a macabre end when they found the decomposing body of a woman in the garden.      The friends found the corpse on Saturday afternoon at the bottom of a steep bank at the end of the garden in the three-storey premises in the southern suburb of Palaiseau, 10 miles south of Paris.      The body was curled up, face down, in a shallow grave and had been covered with branches and logs, police said, adding that the victim was dressed but had no shoes on.      Police said they were treating the woman’s death as murder.      She had no identity papers on her and on Sunday, officers were still trying to find out who she was.      “The state of the body, which was in an advanced stage of decomposition, did not enable investigators to determine the cause of death,” a judicial source said. A post mortem was due to be carried out.      The prosecutor’s office in the nearby suburb of Evry said that “all the signs suggest that this was a criminal act.”      The group who rented the house for the weekend using the online rental website were due to be questioned by police on Sunday. They cancelled plans for their Saturday night party after finding the corpse.      There was no immediate information available on who owned the premises. Airbnb did not reply to a query by the Telegraph as to whether the advert for the house would be maintained on its website.      Airbnb has grown at breakneck speed since it was launched in San Francisco in 2008, and now claims more than 60 million users worldwide.      It has also seen a number of scandals involving theft, property damage and a range of sordid activities in hosts’ apartments.      The French capital last year emerged as the world’s biggest home-sharing city, with more than 40,000 active listings on Airbnb, putting it ahead of both New York and London.      The company paid nearly €1.2 million (£950,000) to Paris city authorities in the last quarter of 2015.      It reached an agreement with the city last year and since October has charged users a tourist tax of 83 cents per night, which it then passes on to the town hall. ||||| Summary:","output":"A group of friends rented a house through Airbnb for a birthday party, but when they got there, they found a decomposing body in the garden. The house was in a town near Paris, France. The body was an older woman, and the police think someone did something bad to her.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in Surrey, British Columbia, Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The \\"prep\\", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the \\"jock\\", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the \\"tranny\\", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night. Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to \\"scare\\" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain.

The founding members were Glenn Frey (guitars, vocals), Don Henley (drums, vocals), Bernie Leadon (guitars, vocals) and Randy Meisner (bass guitar, vocals). With five number-one singles, six Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, and six number-one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) and Hotel California, were ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the United States according to the Recording Industry Association of America. An Eagles country tribute album, titled Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles, was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup. Travis Tritt insisted on having the Long Run-era Eagles in his video for \\"Take It Easy\\" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five Long Run-era members--Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit--supplemented by Scott Crago (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Timothy Drury (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and former Loggins and Messina sideman Al Garth (sax, violin) on stage.  \\"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation,\\" announced Frey at their first live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled Hell Freezes Over (named for Henley's recurring statement that the group would get back together \\"when hell freezes over\\"), which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard album chart. It included four new studio songs, with \\"Get Over It\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey's serious recurrence of diverticulitis, but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996. In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Hotel California.\\" Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.  The Eagles performed at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas on December 28 and 29, 1999, followed by a concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on December 31. These concerts marked the last time Felder played with the band and the shows (including a planned video release) would later form a part of a lawsuit filed by Felder against his former band mates. The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc Selected Works: 1972-1999 box set in November 2000. Along with the concert, this set included the band's hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from The Long Run sessions. Selected Works received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2002. The group resumed touring in 2001, with a line-up consisting of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit, along with Steuart Smith (guitars, mandolin, keyboards, backing vocals; essentially taking over Felder's role), Michael Thompson (keyboards, trombone), Will Hollis (keyboards, backing vocals), Scott Crago (drums, percussion), Bill Armstrong (Horns), Al Garth (sax, violin), Christian Mostert (sax), and Greg Smith (sax, percussion).

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? more complex and honest","output":"To determine whether the phrase \\"more complex and honest\\" is considered positive or negative, I'll examine the connotation of each word and the overall context. Step 1: Analyzing the individual words \\"More\\" implies an increase or improvement in the aspect being discussed. It has a neutral connotation on its own but may lean towards positive or negative based on the aspects it refers to. \\"Complex\\" can have both positive and negative connotations. In a positive context, it can suggest depth, intricacy, or richness. In a negative context, it can imply complications, confusion, or difficulty. The connotation of \\"complex\\" depends on the individual's perception and the context in which it's used. \\"Honest\\" generally has a positive connotation. It implies truthfulness, sincerity, and straightforwardness, which are commonly regarded as positive attributes or actions. Step 2: Assessing the overall context The overall context of the phrase \\"more complex and honest\\" seems to imply a shift toward greater intricacy and truthfulness. Depending on the circumstances, this shift could be perceived as either positive or negative. For example, in a situation where someone is looking for the truth and a deeper understanding of a subject, the complexity and honesty could be seen as positive qualities. In contrast, if the increase in complexity brings difficulties and confusion, the phrase could take on a negative tone. Conclusion: The phrase \\"more complex and honest\\" can be both positive or negative, depending on the context and individual perception. With the lack of a specific context for the phrase, it's challenging to definitively label it as positive or negative. However, given that the word \\"honest\\" typically has a positive sentiment, the phrase may lean slightly towards positive in an ambiguous situation."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others.

Apply the solution in sections, using a pump sprayer or soft, non-abrasive scrub brush. Allow 5-10 minutes for the solution to loosen dirt. Do not allow the solution to dry on the surface of the garage door. Explanation: The correct answer is (a) because it is important to not let the cleaning solution dry on the garage door surface. Allowing the solution to dry can result in residue and streaks, making the door appear unclean and possibly damaging the surface. By not allowing the solution to dry on the door, you are ensuring a more even clean and reducing the likelihood of residue or damage.

Q:The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

If you do not see a small flame burning, then your pilot light has gone out.","output":"Alright, so after checking the pilot light and finding out that it has gone out, here's what you do next to light the water heater: 1. Turn the temperature dial to the lowest setting: This is like turning the heat all the way down so we can be safe while trying to light the pilot light. 2. Turn the gas control valve to \\"off\\": This means stopping any gas from flowing to the water heater, making it safe for you. Wait for a few minutes before moving on to the next step, so that any gas left can go away. 3. Find the pilot light button: This is a special button that will help us turn the little flame back on. It's usually red and can be near the gas control valve. 4. Press and hold the pilot light button: While holding the button, you'll need to use a long lighter or a long match to reach the pilot light location (where the little flame should be). The pilot light might be inside a tube, so carefully put the lighter or match there to create the flame. 5. Keep holding the button for about 30 seconds to 1 minute after the pilot light is back on. This will help make sure that the little flame stays on and doesn't go out. 6. Slowly release the pilot light button: If the little flame stays on, it means you did a good job! If it goes out, try the steps again, starting from step 4. 7. Turn the gas control valve to the \\"on\\" position: This allows gas to flow again, so the water heater can make the water hot. 8. Turn the temperature dial to your desired setting: Now you can choose how hot you want your water to be. The water heater will do the rest of the work!

Does the sentence \\"Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099.\\" answer the question \\"In what year did the First Crusade take Jerusalem?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilized across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099.\\" does indeed answer the question \\"In what year did the First Crusade take Jerusalem?\\" The answer is explicitly provided in the year mentioned in the sentence - 1099.  To delve a bit deeper into this subject, it is important to understand the context of this event. The First Crusade marks a significant event in the history of Europe and the Middle East, often considered as the start of a long period of religious and cultural struggles between Christians and Muslims.  This crusade, proclaimed by Pope Urban II in 1095, was initiated in the hopes of returning the Holy Land, especially Jerusalem, which had been under Islamic rule since the 7th century, back to Christian rule. Jerusalem held great significance for the Christian faith as the site of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Mobilizing tens of thousands of people from all walks of life, including knights, peasants and clerics, the crusade took a grueling three years to cross Europe on foot and by sea. It involved moments of intense warfare and negotiations with different rulers and cities along the way. The siege of Jerusalem began in June 1099 and resulted in the city's capture by the Crusaders by July. A Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was formed thereafter and maintained control until 1187.  It is noteworthy here that the First Crusade was followed by numerous other crusades, each with their reasons and outcomes - but it was the First Crusade that initially achieved its stated goal - the capture of Jerusalem. To sum it up, the sentence in question unambiguously provides the answer to the year of Jerusalem's capture during the First Crusade - which is 1099. However, it also opens up a vast array of complex historical events, chronicling an era of intense religious fervor, expeditions, and socio-political transformations."},{"instruction":"Question: Robin was getting tired and wanted their friends to leave.

We have: -6 * v + 44 = 20 Our goal is to find the value of 'v'. So, let's follow these steps: 1. First, we need to get -6 * v by itself by moving the number beside it to the other side (in this case, it's 44). To move it to the other side, we have to subtract it. So, we subtract 44 from both sides: -6 * v + 44 - 44 = 20 - 44 -6 * v = -24 2. Now, we have -6 * v = -24, and we want to find 'v'. Since -6 is multiplied with 'v', we can find 'v' by dividing both sides by -6: (-6 * v) / -6 = -24 / -6 v = 4 So, the value of 'v' is 4.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which fleet was given new orders to recapture Gotland?  Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty.

Half-Life 2 is a groundbreaking game known for its advanced physics, animation, sound, artificial intelligence, and narrative-driven gameplay. Powered by Valve's proprietary Source engine, the game received critical acclaim and numerous accolades upon its release. Half-Life 2: Deathmatch was released on December 1, 2004, as the multiplayer component of the game. It came as a surprise to many players, as it was released quickly and quietly without any hype or fanfare. This multiplayer addition allowed players to engage in fast-paced online battles featuring the physics-based gameplay that made Half-Life 2 so popular. In Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, players can join one of two teams—the Combine or the Rebels—and compete against each other in various game modes, such as Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. The game's level design, weapons, and character models all come from the main Half-Life 2 campaign, and as a result, the multiplayer experience is consistent with the game's overall narrative and atmosphere. The sudden release of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch can be seen as a strategic move by Valve, as it allowed the company to capitalize on the massive success of the Half-Life 2 launch. By releasing the multiplayer component separately, Valve could keep the game relevant and maintain momentum in the competitive multiplayer gaming space. Science and technology play a significant role in the video game industry, as advances in these fields enable developers to create increasingly immersive and realistic gaming experiences. The release of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is an excellent example of how these technology advances—including networking, physics, and graphics—help shape the gaming landscape. So, this event falls well under the Science and Technology category."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Remembered for his allegiance to the Zengid Dynasty, his life was marked by his contributions to various military endeavors and his reputation as a remarkable figure in the Crusades era. It was in the Battle of Jerusalem in 1187 that Imad ad-Din's skills flourished. As a member of the King's Guard in the Zengid Dynasty's army, this battle was part of the broader conflict of the Third Crusade. The Battle of Jerusalem was crucial for both Christians and Muslims, as Jerusalem was a significant religious and strategic location for both groups. Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani also played a vital role in the Battle of Marj Uyun, where opposing troops clashed during the Third Crusade. His prowess in warfare continued to be demonstrated in the Battle of Hattin, which ultimately led to the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, and the Siege of Jerusalem. Throughout his life, Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani remained a devoted and skilled soldier, the defending his homeland and the Zengid Dynasty's interests.

Das Restaurant ist riesengrou00df und durch die Spielarena fu00fcr Familien gut geeignet, das bedingt allerdings, dass man als Paar meiner Meinung nach hier nicht viel Ruhe bekommt.

The reviewer concludes by saying that the price-performance ratio is not satisfactory, indicating they felt their experience was not worth the price they paid. The reviewer's final sentence is an explicit non-recommendation of the restaurant. The review cannot be considered positive because a positive review would primarily consist of praises and satisfactory comments about the service, atmosphere, or food.

MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- You don't expect to hear an electric saw in church, but Kevin Cross uses the tool along with a frying pan, blender and toaster oven to help free people from debt. Kevin Cross holds the boards steady as a woman uses a reciprocating saw to cut up her credit cards. This money missionary helps people destroy those little plastic shovels, otherwise known as credit cards, that so many people have used to dig their way to financial ruin. \\"It's such an easy message. It really is,\\" says Cross, an ex-con who credits religion for his conversion from thief to money coach. \\"That's why it doesn't take a rocket scientist, it doesn't take a CPA to do it. A first-year bookkeeper can figure out that you can't spend more than you make,\\" he said. Earlier this month, Cross spoke to about 150 people at the Miami Vineyard Community Church where Kevin Fischer is the pastor. \\"You've got to plan your spending; you've got to give back a part to God. You've got to save for the future, and you've got to learn to be content,\\" said Fischer. Fischer says the pressure of money and debt is enormous on people, especially more recently. \\"We should change the marriage vows from 'till death do us part' to 'debt do us part' because that's what's going on, and it's so true,\\" he said. Cross is breathless. As he speaks to the crowd, he's a non-stop, doesn't-come-up-for-air, high-octane money missionary. He uses Christian principles, prayer, common sense, and a few good one-liners to get his message across. \\"I had a 401k, it went to a 201k, went to 101k, now it's just K,\\" he said as the crowd laughs. \\"I'm thinking I got a thousand bucks left, and I can retire for about a week.\\" Cross presides over a day-long sermon on how people can make their lives better by taking control of their spending. He says he tries to demonstrate the long-term effects of irresponsible borrowing. Simple stuff, he says, will make people more content and give them the cushion necessary to give back. His new book is \\"Building Your Financial Fortress in 52 Days.\\" \\"I want to get people to have more margin, so instead of investing in stuff, and stuff that doesn't last, they can invest in people's lives,\\" he said. The tools he uses to hammer home his message go beyond his overhead TV screens, charts and calculators. Cross invites his guests, who pay 25 a head to hear his message, to come up to the front of the room for what he calls the beginning of \\"freedom.\\" On a table, sit a frying pan, a toaster oven, a blender and a wooden sawhorse and an electric saw. About six people cut up their credit cards and bake them in the toaster oven as if they were TV dinners. Others sliced and diced their Visa, MasterCard and Amex, before mixing the pieces with Spam in the blender. At one point, Cross called for some cooking oil as one lady stood over her credit card-saute with a spatula. Holding a plate full of the little pieces of credit card, Cross said, \\"This looks like a melted credit card, but this really represents freedom in these people's lives, because it's the first step.\\" Cellie Mayol says she used to have 10 or 11 credit cards. She put on protective goggles, taped her cards to a two-by-four and shredded them with a reciprocating saw. \\"It just felt like the right thing to do to get me started on the right path,\\" she said. \\"The Sawzall [reciprocating saw] was exhilarating. I love that feeling.\\" Kevin Cross wasn't always this way. About 20 years ago, as a teen, he embezzled about 300,000 from the sheriff's office in Broward County, Florida. Yes, the sheriff's office. Cross was a bookkeeper and skimmed money from an account filled by payments from court judgments. He invested the stolen funds and profited about 50,000 before he was caught. He was charged with fraud and theft, and spent minimal time in jail. He paid half the money back. But, he says, that was another life ago. Cross says it took him four years to crawl out of his own hole; He was 100,000 in debt. \\"I could spend a thousand dollars a day,\\" Cross told the crowd. \\"Although, I'd have to spend about two days recovering from that -- you know what I mean,\\" he said. \\"I completely sabotaged my life, all in one year. I did more damage in one year than most people do in their whole life.\\" One night, as a 20 year old, he says, he was parking cars at Miami's Hyatt Regency hotel. He was wearing black ladies garden shoes, because he couldn't afford the black sneakers that were part of his uniform. A Jaguar pulled up, and inside was one of Miami's most recognizable newsmen, anchorman Dwight Lauderdale. He took the car, turned on the radio, and heard a Christian financial expert say, \\"There is hope for the hopeless. All you have to do is give your heart and soul to the Lord.\\" \\"And then, I thought, oh Lord, if you're there. I need you.\\" \\"I wasn't going to find satisfaction in money. The only place I was going to find it was outside of that, and I found it, in turning my heart over to God.\\" He became a CPA and spends one full day each week doing free financial counseling for needy people. He says he no longer gets high on money. He only helps people understand that they can manage their money in a way that can help themselves, their families and others. Juan and Beth Diaz were at the seminar. They said they ran up their credit cards and that their home, south of Miami, went into foreclosure last year. \\"America has been a very greedy, give-me-now country for so long, and I think it's a wake-up call for everybody that we can live differently,\\" said Beth Diaz. Juan Diaz, her husband, says doing away with credit cards has helped them. The couple plans to be debt free in about 18 months. \\"They're telling you: 'Use me, you need me' -- and they own you. We've gotten to the point where we just don't need credit cards,\\" he explained. \\"Everything we do, we plan, and if we don't have the money, we just don't buy it,\\" he said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses Kevin Cross, a former convict turned money coach who helps people free themselves from debt by using unconventional methods.

An image in a mirror is formed by reflecting light, and light is all our eyes can really see. Given these facts, what can be seen with our eyes among the following options: - motion  - sound  - screams  - laughter  - sunlight  - mirrors  - Echinoids  - movement A:","output":"Among the given options, our eyes can primarily perceive the following: 1. Motion: Motion refers to the change in position of an object with respect to its surroundings over time. Our eyes are capable of detecting motion through the processing of visual information by our brain. When an object moves, it creates a series of images in our field of vision that our brain interprets as motion. Motion perception is crucial for our day-to-day activities, such as avoiding obstacles, tracking moving objects, and observing the environment around us. 2. Sunlight: Sunlight is the primary source of light for our planet. It is a combination of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light emitted by the Sun. Our eyes are specialized in perceiving visible light, which consists of a spectrum of colors that range from violet to red. Sunlight allows us to see our surroundings and is essential for various biological processes, including maintaining our circadian rhythm, synthesizing vitamin D, and supporting the growth of plants through photosynthesis. 3. Mirrors: Mirrors are surfaces capable of reflecting light, enabling us to observe reflected images of our surroundings and ourselves. They work based on the principle of specular reflection, where light rays bounce off a smooth surface at the same angle as they arrived. When placed in a well-lit environment, mirrors allow us to see images that are formed as a result of the light being reflected off nearby objects and entering our eyes. 4. Echinoids: Echinoids, also known as sea urchins, are marine creatures that belong to the phylum Echinodermata. They possess a rigid, spiny outer shell, and can be found across various ocean habitats. Since echinoids are physical objects that reflect light, our eyes can perceive their outer appearance, which includes color, shape, and texture. Observations of echinoids are possible when they are visible above the surface of the water or when we view them underwater using external light sources or natural sunlight. 5. Movement: Similar to motion, movement refers to the act of changing the position or location of an object or being. Our eyes can detect movement by processing the visual information associated with the change in position of an object within our field of vision. The perception of movement can provide us with information about the direction, speed, and nature of the motion, which ultimately aids us in interpreting and interacting with our surroundings. It is important to note that while our eyes can observe visual aspects of the world around us, they are incapable of directly perceiving sound and emotions such as screams and laughter. Instead, we rely on our auditory system to perceive sounds, while our understanding of emotions typically comes through a combination of auditory, visual, and contextual cues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is worth noting that there are conflicting reports on whether Ms. Dawson was causing a disturbance in the hospital with her language and the volume of her voice, as per the local police chief. However, her family strongly refutes this claim.  Tragically, while being escorted outside by the police, Dawson collapsed. According to her family, a doctor could not detect a pulse before she was taken back inside the hospital. Despite the hospital's claim that staff checked her vitals multiple times before readmitting her and found her to be stable, hospital staff did not attempt CPR until she was returned to the building. Unfortunately, within two hours, Barbara Dawson was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed that Dawson died due to a blood clot in her lung, a complication caused by her excessive weight. It is evident that Barbara Dawson's pleas for further treatment were not adequately addressed, leading to her forcible removal from the hospital and her tragic death shortly after. In response to this sad turn of events, Dawson's family plans to sue the hospital and the police department for their mishandling of the situation. Despite the impending legal action, the hospital maintains that its staff did their best to save Ms. Dawson. Meanwhile, the police department is conducting an investigation into the events that unfolded. This unfortunate incident highlights the importance of effective communication between patients and medical professionals, as well as the need for empathy and understanding when dealing with individuals who are in distress and urgently require assistance. Given the variations in the accounts of the events leading to Barbara Dawson's untimely death, it is crucial that an extensive investigation be conducted to uncover the true circumstances of the incident and ensure justice is served."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Given the fact that:  Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate.  Answer the question:   Katie is looking at solid reactants, and is wondering how they will react. The reaction rate is increased in surface areas which are larger or smaller? Answer:","output":"Katie is considering the reaction rate of solid reactants and questioning how the surface area of these reactants may influence the reaction rate. To address her query, it is essential to understand the factors governing the rate of a chemical reaction. The rate of chemical reactions is influenced by various factors, including the concentration of reactants, the temperature, the presence of a catalyst, and the surface area of solid reactants involved. The concept of surface area becomes particularly significant when the reaction involves solid reactants. In the given statement, it is mentioned that increasing the surface area of solid reactants leads to an increase in the reaction rate. This can be explained by understanding the underlying principles governing chemical reactions, primarily the collision theory. According to the collision theory, a chemical reaction can occur if the reacting particles collide with each other with sufficient energy and appropriate orientation. Greater the number of effective collisions, faster the chemical reaction proceeds. When the surface area of a solid reactant increases, it means that there are more reactant particles exposed and available for interaction with the particles of the other reactants. A larger surface area offers more opportunities for collisions between the reacting particles, thus enhancing the likelihood of effective collisions. Consequently, the reaction rate increases. In comprehending the relationship between the surface area and reaction rate, it is crucial to recognize that the particle size is inversely proportional to the surface area. When a solid is broken into smaller pieces or the particle size decreases, the surface area increases. As a result, in the context of Katie's question, larger surface areas correspond to smaller particle sizes. In conclusion, to answer Katie's query, an increased reaction rate is observed in solid reactants with larger surface areas or, more specifically, smaller particle sizes. By increasing the surface area of solid reactants, Katie can expect a faster reaction rate due to the greater likelihood of effective particle collisions taking place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the place that the legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving cotton mills?  Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines,  2.3 miles (3.7 km) north of Oldham, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) southeast of Rochdale, and 8.7 miles (14 km) to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989. Shaw and Crompton, which covers 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011.

It doesn't provide any information to suggest that Taylor visited the mall ([I] go to the mall) or damaged the jeans ([II] rip the jeans).

First, let's see what we have: -66*h = -105*h + 41*h - 2 - 26 Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation by adding and subtracting the terms with 'h' in them: -66*h = (-105*h + 41*h) - 2 - 26 -105*h + 41*h = -64*h (because -105 + 41 = -64) Now our equation looks like this: -66*h = -64*h - 2 - 26 Next, we will move the -64*h from the right side to the left side by adding 64*h to both sides: -66*h + 64*h = -2 - 26 This simplifies to: -2*h = -2 - 26 Now, let's combine the numbers on the right side (-2 and -26) by adding them: -2*h = -28 (because -2 + -26 = -28) Finally, we need to find the value of 'h'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2*h) / -2 = -28 / -2 h = 14 (because -28 divided by -2 is 14) So, the answer to the math problem is h = 14."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use in conjunction with a...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the work Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of, was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger?

Ben Richards (Ayres) of the Air Force Space Command insists that Dan is their best pilot, even though when piloting the Y-12 into the ionosphere, he began experiencing flight difficulties. Upon landing, Dan broke flight regulations by going to see his girlfriend (Landi), rather than immediately filing his flight report. Despite these concerns, Capt. Richards insists that Dan pilot the Y-13 after a thorough check-out and briefing by Dr. Paul von Essen ([Jaffe). The Y-13 takes off, and at 600,000 feet, Dan is supposed to level off and begin his descent. But he continues to climb, firing his rocket emergency boost for more speed. He climbs to 1,320,000 feet (250 miles) and suddenly loses control of the Y-13 while passing through a dense cloud of unknown material, which forces him to eject. The New Mexico State Police later send a report that a Mexican farmer spotted a parachute, attached to some sort of aircraft, land near his farm, 10 miles south of Alvarado, New Mexico. Chief Wilson (Bill Nagy) meets with Cmdr. Prescott, showing him the wreckage. Tests later show that the automatic escape mechanism and braking chute operated perfectly.

He studied industrial engineering and economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and later earned a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University in the United States. Before entering politics, Piñera had a successful career as an entrepreneur and businessman. He was involved in various industries, including media, airlines, and retail. One of his most notable ventures was the successful turnaround of LAN Airlines, which is now part of the LATAM Airlines Group. His first significant involvement in politics began in 1990 when he became a senator for the Renewal party. In 2005, he ran for the presidency but lost in the second round to the socialist candidate, Michelle Bachelet. In 2009, Piñera ran again for president and won the election, defeating the ruling Concertación coalition candidate, Senator Eduardo Frei Montalva. His first term as president involved various significant events in Chilean history, such as the 2010 earthquake and subsequent tsunami, the rescue of the trapped miners in the Copiapó mining accident, and the implementation of important reforms in the education and labor sectors. After completing his first term and seeing Michelle Bachelet return to the presidency from 2014 to 2018, Piñera ran for president again. He won the 2017 election and took the oath of office on March 11, 2018, making him the first Chilean president since 1932 to serve a second non-consecutive term.

(November 2015) In New York City in the fall of 1937, 17-year-old high-school student Richard Samuels meets Orson Welles, who unexpectedly offers him the role of Lucius in Caesar, the first production of his new Mercury Theatre repertory company. The company is immersed in rehearsals at its Broadway theater. Charmed by Welles, Richard infers that he is having an affair with the leading actress while his wife is pregnant. Richard finds ambitious production assistant Sonja Jones is attracted to him. Welles tells Richard a few days before the premiere that he is worried, because he has recently had nothing but good luck; he fears that he will finally have bad luck with the premiere, and that the play will be a flop. During rehearsals Richard accidentally sets off the sprinkler system, soaking the entire theatre. When accused by Welles he denies having anything to do with the deluge, and suggests that the catastrophe was the bad luck that Welles needed to get out of the way. Welles decides the entire production crew would benefit from a coupling game, and Richard cheats to ensure he is paired with Sonja. Richard spends the night with Sonja, but becomes jealous when she spends the next night with Welles. He confronts Welles, mentions his pregnant wife, and is fired. An apparent reconciliation follows, and Richard performs on the first night. The anti-fascist adaptation of Caesar is a huge success, but after the premiere, Richard is told that Welles only needed him in order to secure a successful first-night production and, that done, he has again been fired. The broken-hearted but wiser Richard spontaneously recites lines from Julius Caesar in his high school English class, to his classmates' applause. He later meets up with a likely new girlfriend, Gretta Adler, a young aspiring playwright whom he met in a music store at the film's beginning.

Question: Given the below context:  War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.

Reducing resource use means just what it says using fewer resources. There are lots of ways to reduce our use of resources. Buy durable goods. Choose items that are well made so they will last longer. Youll buy fewer items in the long run, so youll save money as well as resources. Thats a win-win! Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt. Youll use fewer resources and save money. Buy only what you need.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: INDEPENDENCE, Kan. – As Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) toured this state earlier this week with Robert J. Dole, the former Republican leader waxed nostalgic about the bipartisanship deal-making that marked his days running the Senate. Dole specifically criticized Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) for his role in last fall’s government shutdown. An ailing Kansas legend at 91, Dole still has his signature wit. He told one crowd, “Some of those guys are so far on the right they’re gonna fall out of the Capitol.” But the message from the Roberts campaign was starkly different here Thursday morning, when Sarah Palin swooped into Independence to bestow her grass-roots tea party credibility on the surprisingly troubled Roberts re-election campaign. Palin praised Roberts as a rock-ribbed conservative “who will fight like our country’s future depends on it.” And the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee thanked Roberts for standing alongside Cruz in filibustering funding for President Obama’s signature health-care law, a move which resulted in the shutdown. “He’s not wishy-washy on the fence like you know who, the other guy,” Palin said, a reference to Roberts’s opponent, independent candidate Greg Orman. “I am so thankful because we need those with that stiff spine, with the principles that are so invicted [sic] within them, that they take a side.” The contrast between Dole and Palin underscores both the troubles for Roberts here at home and the sudden urgency for the national Republican Party in holding a Senate seat in conservative Kansas that is in serious jeopardy. Surrogates from across the party’s ideological spectrum have been in Kansas this week or are due here in coming days to stump with Roberts, including Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.). With fewer than six weeks until Election Day, Roberts has yet to consolidate Republican base voters behind his candidacy. Roberts won a bruising Aug. 5 primary with just 48 percent of the vote. The runner-up -- tea party-aligned Milton Wolf, who garnered 41 percent -- has yet to endorse Roberts. Bringing Palin into Kansas for a campaign stop was designed in large part to energize conservative activists about the incumbent. As Palin and Roberts served pancakes and sausage links to a couple hundred supporters inside an old museum here, The Washington Post asked Palin why she thinks Wolf has not endorsed Roberts. Roberts tried to bat away the question: “Oh, come on, man,” he told The Post. But Palin answered: “I’m tea party, and I’m endorsing him. I don’t know a tea partier who isn’t endorsing him.” In her remarks to the crowd earlier, Palin sought to sow doubts about Orman, who is campaigning as an independent “problem solver” and says he will caucus with whichever party has a “clear” majority following November’s midterm elections. “Here in Independence, I know a little bit about going rogue,” Palin said. She added, “Anybody with a liberal record like Greg’s -- supporting Barack Obama, supporting Obamacare, supporting amnesty, supporting Harry Reid -- that’s not independence. That’s someone who’s trying to snooker you, Kansas!” Orman campaign manager Jim Jonas responded to Palin’s visit with a statement: \\"Kansans know Washington is broken, and politicians like Senator Robert [sic] are part of the problem in Washington. Kansans don’t want another politician, they want a proven problem solver who will fix Washington’s broken system.” Roberts basked in the energy of Palin’s visit to tiny Independence, an outpost on the rural plains of Eastern Kansas that was prosperous a half-century ago but now has many shuttered storefronts and fewer than 10,000 residents. Palin wore a purple Kansas State sweatshirt for the occasion. Roberts played to the crowd: “Have you ever seen a Mama Grizzly dressed as a Wildcat?” Turning to Palin, he asked, “You wouldn’t be able to kick a field goal, would you?” In Kansas, Republicans have been deeply divided this year over the reelection of Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican who has instituted some far-right tax and spending policies. Many prominent establishment Republicans took the unusual step of endorsing Brownback’s Democratic opponent. Roberts said Palin had come to Kansas to show that the Republican Party was united. “Every square inch of the Republican Party knows what’s at stake,” Roberts said. “We have to take the Senate back as a first step for turning our country around with Kansas values as opposed to what’s going on in Washington, D.C.” Talking with reporters following the event, Roberts said he joined Cruz’s filibuster to point out “what was going wrong with Obamacare,” not to try and shut down the government. Kasie Hunt of MSNBC pointed out that Dole’s message of bipartisanship and Palin’s message of fighting for principles conflicted. “Whose side are you on?” she asked Roberts. “Both,” Roberts said. “How ‘bout that?\\" Title:","output":"Dole and Palin Show Different Sides of Republican Party in Kansas Senate Race"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

House The option in line with common sense to answer the question, \\"Where do you play board games?\\" is option D, house. A house typically has various spaces suitable for playing board games, such as the living room, dining room, family room, or even a dedicated game room. Playing board games in a house allows for comfort, privacy and convenience, making it the most logical option among the choices provided. Let's examine the other options: A. Shelf - While a shelf is a common place to store board games when they are not in use, it is not an appropriate area to actually play them. Shelves are typically used for storage and display purposes and may not have enough space or stability to support an ongoing game. B. Toy store - Toy stores often sell board games but are generally not designed for customers to play games inside. Additionally, playing a board game in a store environment could disrupt the shopping experience for other customers and potentially create conflicts with store personnel. C. Shelter - Shelters are usually set up to provide temporary living accommodations for those in need, such as disaster victims, homeless individuals, or stray animals. They do not primarily serve as locations to play board games. However, there might be instances in which shelter residents play board games to pass the time, but it's not the ideal or primary location for this activity. E. Den - A den is a part of a house, typically used as a relaxing or informal space separate from the main living areas.

Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including \\"illustrated song\\", \\"filmed insert\\", \\"promotional (promo) film\\", \\"promotional clip\\", \\"promotional video\\", \\"song video\\", \\"song clip\\" or \\"film clip\\". Since the creation and increased popularity of YouTube, mainstream artists now promote new music videos by releasing trailers of short promos on the site for their upcoming song and music video. Consequentially, YouTube has been converted into a social media platform for celebrities and artists to market themselves to their fans  - Live Monsters is an EP recorded and released by Jars of Clay. The EP contains songs that were recorded live on their tour in support of their studio album, \\"Good Monsters\\". At first release, the only method of purchasing the album was either at one of their concerts or through Jars Of Clay's official store. However, Essential has since released the EP for purchase through the iTunes Store and was released to mainstream music stores on September 4, 2007. The track listing of the two releases varies as \\"All My Tears\\" and \\"Love Me\\" from the initial release are substituted for \\"Good Monsters\\" and \\"Surprise\\".  - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty.  - WOW Hits 2007 is a two-disc compilation album of songs that represent the best of Christian music of 2006. It was released on October 3, 2006.  - Good Monsters is the seventh full-length studio album from Jars of Clay, released by Essential Records on September 5, 2006. This is their last album of new material from Essential Records and it is said to be lyrically their most aggressive album to date. It features eleven original songs, and a remake of \\"All My Tears\\" by Julie Miller. It also features guest appearances by singer/songwriter Kate York (on \\"Even Angels Cry\\"), Leigh Nash, of Sixpence None the Richer (on \\"Mirrors & Smoke\\"), and the African Children's Choir (on \\"Light Gives Heat\\").  - Julie Anne Miller (born Julie Griffin, July 12, 1956) is a songwriter, singer, and recording artist currently living in Nashville, Tennessee.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: A Knight's Tale Context: At a jousting tournament in 14th-century Europe, young squires William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat discover that their master, Sir Ector, has died. If he had completed one final pass he would have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Ector's armour to impersonate him, winning the tournament and taking the prize. Although only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is now inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their share of coins and leave, but William convinces them to stay and train him to joust. Along the way to his first tournament in Rouen, the trio encounters a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge the patent of nobility that will allow William to enter under the assumed name of \\"Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein\\" from Gelderland. At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment. In the course of competition, William's armour is damaged. He goads Kate, a female blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the sword event at the tournament. In the joust, he faces a Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honour of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust of the tournament, Adhemar defeats William. Kate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armour allowing him greater mobility. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually Edward, the Black Prince. Adhemar withdraws, but William continues the match and then addresses the prince by name, further earning Edward's respect. Adhemar...

Identify key words and phrases:    - \\"humorous observations\\"   - \\"general absurdity of modern life\\"   - \\"eyes of outsiders\\" 3. Analyze sentiment of key words and phrases:   - \\"humorous observations\\" has a positive sentiment, as it suggests that the film provides an amusing take on a topic.   - \\"general absurdity of modern life\\" has a neutral-to-negative sentiment, depending on how one interprets \\"absurdity.\\" It implies that modern life can be somewhat ridiculous, but this is not necessarily associated with a bad or good experience – it just is.   - \\"eyes of outsiders\\" is a neutral phrase that indicates a perspective. It tells us that this humor is derived from observing modern life as someone who is not part of it, but it does not hold any sentiment on its own. 4. Combine sentiment analysis to understand overall sentiment:   - Since \\"humorous observations\\" has a positive sentiment and the other phrases are neutral or only mildly negative, the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive.

Please answer the following question: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of Tchaikovsky's former teacher? ?  As The Five's campaign against Rubinstein continued in the press, Tchaikovsky found himself almost as much a target as his former teacher. Cui reviewed the performance of Tchaikovsky's graduation cantata and lambasted the composer as \\"utterly feeble.... If he had any talent at all ... it would surely at some point in the piece have broken free of the chains imposed by the Conservatory.\\" The review's effect on the sensitive composer was devastating. Eventually, an uneasy truce developed as Tchaikovsky became friendly with Balakirev and eventually with the other four composers of the group. A working relationship between Balakirev and Tchaikovsky resulted in Romeo and Juliet. The Five's approval of this work was further followed by their enthusiasm for Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony. Subtitled the Little Russian (Little Russia was the term at that time for what is now called the Ukraine) for its use of Ukrainian folk songs, the symphony in its initial version also used several compositional devices similar to those used by the Five in their work. Stasov suggested the subject of Shakespeare's The Tempest to Tchaikovsky, who wrote a tone poem based on this subject. After a lapse of several years, Balakirev reentered Tchaikovsky's creative life; the result was Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony, composed to a program after Lord Byron originally written by Stasov and supplied by Balakirev. Overall, however, Tchaikovsky continued down an independent creative path, traveling a middle course between those of his nationalistic peers and the traditionalists.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God.

Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

I can use this background: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.  Now, I have a new situation: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores.  The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.

The Mobutu pack was following large groups of zebras and other grazers, implying that they were focusing on herds as their primary hunting target.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The remaining vampire covens are on the verge of annihilation by the Lycans. Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven. Meanwhile, Alexia has told Marius, who is secretly her lover, that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and his Lycans attack that coven. Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic vampires, who are led by Vidar's daughter Lena. Selene engages Marius in single combat, but he is too powerful in werewolf form, and she is stabbed by Alexia. Marius demands to know Eve's location, but Selene insists she does not know; Alexia confirms this after tasting blood from her sword. Marius sounds the retreat. Selene deliberately slides herself under the now broken ice of the lake, telling herself that this is the 'path'. The answer to this question is:","output":"In the given context, Selene, a vampire, is stabbed by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire who was dispatched by Semira. This occurs during a battle at the Nordic Coven stronghold, Var Dohr, between the Lycans led by Marius and the Nordic vampires led by Lena, Elder Vidar's daughter. Selene engages Marius in combat, but due to his overwhelming power in werewolf form, she is stabbed by Alexia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you. Question: The narrator was thankful: === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The narrator was thankful for the ability of their body to remain healthy and function properly despite the mistreatment they subjected it to in the past.

The music and fashion styles created daily in Britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled (there really has been nothing new since 1980).

Possible A: u.s, forrest, grand canyon, park, canada  Why is \\"forrest\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Forrest\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because of the following reasons: 1. Contextual understanding: The question describes a bald eagle making a nest in a tree surrounded by others, which implies that the location is likely a place with an abundance of trees. 2. Analysis of options: Among the given options (u.s, forrest, grand canyon, park, and canada), \\"forrest\\" specifically refers to a large area of land covered with trees. While the other options may contain forests, they are more generic geographical or political areas that aren't specifically associated with trees or habitats for bald eagles. 3. Semantics: The term \\"vast\\" in the question implies a considerable amount of space; a forest aligns with this characteristic, as it consists of a large expanse of trees. 4. Common knowledge: Humans typically understand that birds like the bald eagle often nest in forested areas, using the natural resources and protection provided by the tree covers. Other options like \\"grand canyon\\" or \\"canada\\" do not provide specific information about the presence of trees or a suitable habitat. 5.

Somewhere in the 17th century, after attacking and boarding one of the Kingdom of Monterria's ships, the pirate Robert the Terrible captures the Prince Alexander and sends his men in search of Princess Eloise. Eluding the pirates, Eloise and her servant Willory emerge and send a device that the king made, called a \\"Helpseeker,\\" to find heroes to save Alexander. In modern times, three misfits: the \\"yes man\\" George, the lazy Sedgewick, and the timid Elliot (Larry the Cucumber) are employees at a dinner theater. Although they want to be seen as heroes by their loved ones, as lowly cabin boys they think their dream is unattainable. After wrecking the show, they are fired and thrown into the alley, where the Helpseeker locates them. Elliot activates the device, transporting them to Monterria. Meeting Eloise and Willory, the group sets off to Jolly Joe's Tavern where they learn that Robert, the brother of the king, has kidnapped Alexander in the hopes of exacting revenge on his brother, who banished him. Setting sail in search of the whereabouts of Robert's hideout, the pirate's men capture Eloise and Willory. As George and Elliot continue on their quest, a cowardly Sedgewick decides to stay behind in a cave filled with \\"cheese curls\\", afraid to face Robert. After the two leave, however, Sedgewick discovers the curls are living worm-like creatures and is chased out of the cave, overcoming his fear and laziness along the way.

Driven by a motive of revenge against his brother, the King, who had banished him, he proceeded to kidnap Prince Alexander. The act of banishment obviously caused resentment in Robert which led him to orchestrate his revenge plot. Often, banishment is a form of punishment used by rulers or governing bodies to send individuals away from their native land or royal territories, either as a punitive measure or to eliminate potential threats. In this case, the King banished Robert, branding him an outlaw, and hence, he took on the persona of a pirate, performing acts of defiance such as the capture of the Prince. However, his banishment and subsequent actions set in motion a series of events involving the helpseeker, a device which led to the involvement of the three misfits - George, Sedgewick and Elliot, in the rescue mission to save the Prince and thwart Robert's plans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Shades of the United States vs. Microsoft, an antitrust case that the government lost A report in Monday’s New York Post that two government agencies — the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice — are each considering launching an antitrust investigation against Apple AAPL puts me in mind of the case the DOJ and 20 states brought against Microsoft MSFT nearly a dozen years ago. To many observers — including the judge who heard the case — U.S. vs. Microsoft seemed open and shut. In Nov. 1999, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found that Microsoft’s dominance of the PC operating systems market constituted a monopoly and that the company had illegally used that power to try to crush Apple, Java, Netscape, Lotus Notes, Real Networks, Linux, and others. His remedy, offered the next spring, was to break Microsoft into two units, one that made operating systems and another that made applications. Microsoft immediately appealed, and while it couldn’t overturn the findings of fact, it successfully fought the remedy. Based on embargoed interviews Judge Jackson had given the press during the trial, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found he had displayed anti-Microsoft bias and conducted himself unethically. It handed the case to another judge with instructions to craft a more modest remedy. The case was settled in Nov. 2001. Microsoft remains intact and its software still runs nearly 9 out of 10 of the world’s PCs, although to many in the industry, the company doesn’t seem to have the kind of swagger it exhibited before and during the trial. Given that history, what chances does the government have against Apple? The issue here, according to the Post‘s report, is a clause — Section 3.3.1 — added to the latest iteration of the iPhone software developers agreement that prohibits programmers from writing apps for the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch using “an intermediary translation or compatibility layer.” As the Post sees it, the new policy “kills competition by forcing programmers to choose between developing apps that can run only on Apple gizmos or come up with apps that are platform neutral, and can be used on a variety of operating systems, such as those from rivals Google, Microsoft and Research In Motion.” To win a Sherman Antitrust case against Apple, the government would have to prove both that Apple’s market share constitutes a monopoly — itself not illegal — and that it has abused that monopoly power in ways that damage its competition. While it is true that Apple controls what apps can run on its mobile devices and even what tools developers can use to write those apps, it’s going to be harder to show that it has a monopoly of the smartphone market or that its competitors have been harmed the way Microsoft’s were. The case against Microsoft was launched after Bill Gates bundled a free Web browser (Explorer) into Windows — which had a market share at the time in the mid 90’s — cutting off Netscape’s air supply (to use the language of Microsoft’s internal memos) and driving it out of business. Apple’s doesn’t enjoy that kind of market share. Its slice of the U.S. smartphone market is smaller than Research in Motion’s RIMM and Google’s GOOG Android share is rapidly catching up. And while there are companies that can legitimately claim they have been harmed by the success of the iPhone — Palm PALM comes first to mind — Palm can hardly blame Section 3.3.1 of the SDK for its troubles. Adobe ADBE might — and probably has — filed a complaint against Apple based on the damage Apple has done to its efforts to promote Flash as a cross-platform development tool. And if the DOJ takes the case, it could use the line of attack it used against Microsoft, arguing that the “network effects” of the iPhone OS and the App Store tend to lock customers into Apple’s ecosystem, and that to create a level playing field, the two businesses should be forcibly separated. It didn’t work 12 year ago, and it’s hard to see how it’s going to work today.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who stole the diamonds? ?  Three men rob a millionaire of diamonds aboard an airliner in flight. When Police Superintendent Benting tries to intervene, Jack Drake, another passenger, knocks him out to save him from being shot. The thieves force the pilot to land so they can dump the passengers. However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake).  Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction. The baroness tells her maid Annie that certain passages somehow remind her of Drake, who broke her heart.  By coincidence, she is residing in the same hotel as Drake. He goes to see her, but she does not forgive him for leaving her without a word in Berlin. He explains that he was forced to leave suddenly, but she is not mollified. Meanwhile, Drake instructs Burdge, his secretary, to send a cheque for £10,000 to the Buckingham Hospital for a new wing, even though Burdge informs him he is overdrawn at the bank. Drake tells him that the wealthy Mrs. Humbold's pearls will provide ample funds. The Humbolds are hosting a masquerade ball that night, and the baroness will be there. At the ball, part of the entertainment is a group called the \\"Four Gangsters\\", who have been tied up and replaced by a gang of real gangsters, the same thieves from the aeroplane caper. Sculpie, their leader, kills an unarmed man who foolishly tries to resist. Afterward, however, Sculpie is furious to learn that the pearls he took from Mrs. Humbold are fakes. Once again, Drake has the real ones. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who stole the diamonds is Jack. Jack Drake is the one who had stolen the diamonds from the three men who initially robbed the millionaire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a  visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.

I read this background article the other day: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  I am facing a new situation today: Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species C, the females had long gestational periods. In the second species, species D, the females had short gestational periods.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which species will have shorter living individuals? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article about Aristotle's observations and predictions regarding live-bearing tetrapods, several general patterns can be inferred: 1. Adult body mass is inversely correlated with brood size. 2. Lifespan is positively correlated with gestation period and body mass. 3. Fecundity (number of offspring) is inversely correlated with lifespan. In your new situation, Albert, the scientist, discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods: species C, with long gestational periods, and species D, with short gestational periods. Considering Aristotle's observations and the correlations he identified, we can attempt to answer your question: Which species will have shorter living individuals? Given the positive correlation between lifespan and gestation period (rule 2), we can infer that species C, with a longer gestation period, should generally have a longer lifespan. Conversely, species D, with a shorter gestation period, should generally have a shorter lifespan. Therefore, based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, species D will have shorter living individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: What phase exists when all the water in a container has physical properties intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Supercritical Fluids If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 °C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 °C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35).

The young General Answer:","output":"Title: Shadows of the Past Genre: Historical Drama Tagline: Challenge the pride of the young General, unravel the hidden truths of an era. Plot: Act I: The film opens in a small village in 1850s France. It's a time of peace and prosperity, but dark shadows lurk beneath the surface. When the inhabitants of the village gather in a local tavern for drinks and merrymaking, they often share stories of their experiences, and a recurring topic that arises is the legend of the young General who was said to be arrogant and condescending. One day, a mysterious traveler named Henri arrives in town, and he seems to be interested in the tales about the young General. After spending some time in the village, Henri befriends Aldric, an aspiring young writer, who shares Henri's fascination with the story of the General. Act II: As local whispers intensify about the identity of this young General, Henri and Aldric decide to investigate the historical legends of the village. It is said that several notable battles were fought in the region, and the General played a crucial role in the victories that led to France's restoration and growth. Through research and interviews with the oldest residents of the village, the pair discovers that the General's condescending attitude was in fact a cover for his insecurities and hidden traumas inflicted during the conflicts. Determined to learn the truth about the young General, Henri and Aldric set out on a journey to visit battlefields, historic libraries, and museums, uncovering a complex tapestry of stories and experiences involving the General and his relationships with others. Act III: While deep in their search for the truth, the duo encounters a set of fragile letters written by the young General himself. The letters reveal the harsh realities of warfare and the emotional turmoil that plagued the once-admired figure. The cold and unemotional facade of the General slowly dissipates as Henri and Aldric read his letters. It is slowly revealed that the General had struggled to cope with the death of his brother in one of the battles, which had broken him emotionally. Upon visiting the General's childhood home, Henri and Aldric find an elderly woman, who they soon learn is the General's widow, Madame Delacour. She reluctantly opens up about her husband's life and shares her own perspective on his condescending demeanor. She speaks of his genuine love for their children and his crucial role in rebuilding the nation. Act IV: Equipped with the knowledge of the young General's true nature, Henri and Aldric return to the village to share their findings. As they retell the complex story, unveiling the depth of human struggle and resilience, they establish new compassion for a man once believed to be condescending and arrogant. The film concludes with a reflection on the duality of human nature, and a powerful message about the danger of judging others based on outward appearances that may hide deep inner pain and suffering. The village itself embodies this message, as beneath the facade of peace and prosperity lies an undercurrent of dark secrets, a reminder that the past can only be silenced for so long before the truth begins to reveal itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What legislation has endorsments from AHNA, AMA, APHA? Context: The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

John practiced organic farming and also produced organic milk, while Danny sold non-organic produce and milk.  Which farmer had fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on his farm?  Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. A:","output":"Given the information provided, John, who practiced organic farming and produced organic milk, likely had fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens on his farm compared to Danny, who sold non-organic produce and milk. Organic farming aims to promote public health and food safety by eliminating contaminations and the presence of agents that can cause human diseases. In organic farming, the use of antibiotics and chemicals is restricted. This is particularly true when it comes to utilizing antibiotics as a preventative measure, which is not allowed in organic practices. While it's true that dairy cows in both conventional and organic farming can be exposed to pathogens, research has shown that the lack of preemptive use of antibiotics in organic farms leads to fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens. As a result, organic farms benefit from a higher efficacy of antibiotics when they are needed for treating specific health issues. So, based on the hint provided and the principles of organic farming, John's organic farm would have a lower prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens compared to Danny's non-organic farm."},{"instruction":"Title: Dump Fred, Find Zach.....

When it's raining, there is generally less sunlight available, which means less sunlight hits the chloroplasts in the plants. Since sunlight is necessary for the photosynthesis process, the reduced amount of sunlight will have a lessening effect on the splitting of water molecules by the enzyme in the plant. Consequently, there will be a lower production of oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons.

They had been friends since middle school, bonding over their shared love of comic books, technology, and action movies. As high school graduates turned young entrepreneurs, having their own business based on their strengths was a dream come true. They named it \\"Tech and Tackle Solutions\\" and began offering their services to the residents of their small, middle-class town. One day, Lawrence and Ryan were at their office, attending to various clients. Lawrence was troubleshooting a laptop that had refused to boot for a desperate college student, while Ryan was assisting an older lady who needed help lifting several boxes of books. Their diversified skill sets allowed them to cater to both technological and physical problems, making them a one-stop solution for all sorts of tasks. As they were hard at work, the doors of their office suddenly swung open, revealing a stressed-looking man in a suit. \\"Please, you have to help me!\\" he exclaimed, looking around desperately for any available staff. Lawrence and Ryan exchanged glances, sensing this could be both a tech and a tackle issue. \\"Sir,\\" Lawrence said calmly, standing up from his chair, \\"Please tell us what you need help with. We're here to assist you.\\" The man, introducing himself as Mr. Thompson, explained that he had just moved into town and was in the process of setting up a local branch for his rapidly growing company, Thompson Tech Innovations. They specialized in developing AI technology for use in industries such as healthcare, agriculture, and education. While moving into their new office, they encountered several issues – some technical, and others, physical in nature. Their computers needed to be set up and synced in a server room, numerous heavy furniture pieces had to be moved into the appropriate locations, and they also needed to set up an internal security system for the office. Having never been faced with such a gigantic project, Lawrence and Ryan felt thrilled. They knew this could be their biggest break, proving that their company was capable of handling high-stakes, large-scale projects. So, they got to work immediately. Lawrence started by assessing the computer setup, while Ryan made a plan to move the furniture and equipment efficiently and safely. They communicated with Mr. Thompson and his team, worked diligently to complete the tasks, and enlisted the help of other specialized technicians and contractors whenever necessary. Throughout the following weeks, Lawrence dealt with technical issues ranging from setting up and optimizing the server room, troubleshooting errors, connecting all office computers, and implementing a secure firewall and antivirus solution. He even provided training to Mr. Thompson's employees on how to use the new software systems, ensuring seamless operations. Concurrently, Ryan coordinated a team of skilled movers and laborers to speed up the physical setup of the office. Painstakingly, they maneuvered heavy metallic desks, ergonomic chairs, conference tables, and filing cabinets into their respective locations. Ryan also ensured that the equipment and furniture were aligned with the office's designated layout to maximize workflow efficiency. After a long and exhausting week, the duo successfully transformed the office into a tech haven. In gratitude, Mr. Thompson offered them a lucrative contract to provide ongoing tech support, maintenance, and occasional physical assistance. This was a turning point for Tech and Tackle Solutions, cementing their professional reputation and ensuring their long-term viability. From then on, Lawrence and Ryan continued to thrive, as their business attracted a wider variety of clients, keeping them busy with new challenges both in the technical and physical domains. They never lost sight of their humble beginnings, always remembering the importance of a strong work ethic and the value of determination.

Write an article with the title: \\"Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes at the Frick Collection\\" Article:","output":"Title: Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes at the Frick Collection Introduction: The Frick Collection, founded by American industrialist Henry Clay Frick, is an art museum in New York City that houses a prestigious collection of old master paintings, European sculpture, and decorative arts. Among its treasures are the superb Renaissance and Baroque bronzes, which span from the early 15th century to the late 17th century. This article seeks to highlight the distinctive features of these Renaissance and Baroque bronzes and explore their significance in the museum's collection.  Step 1: Provide an overview of Renaissance and Baroque bronzes in the collection Among the Frick Collection's most captivating displays are the small-scale bronze sculptures that exemplify the skill and mastery of artists in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. The collection features works by prominent sculptors, such as Donatello, Giambologna, and Adriaen de Vries, who advanced the technical and stylistic achievements of their time. These artists transformed the field of bronze sculpture, producing works that remain influential to this day. Step 2: Discuss the stylistic differences between the two periods Renaissance bronzes reflect the period's interest in reviving classical forms and ideals, with sculptures often depicting mythological subjects or illustrious figures from a historical context. These masterpieces display a strong emphasis on balance, proportion, and anatomical accuracy as artists sought to rival the excellence of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. Key examples at the Frick Collection include Donatello's \\"Seated Cupid\\" and Antico's \\"Hercules.\\" In contrast, Baroque bronzes usher in a more dynamic approach to sculpture, fueled by a fascination with movement, energy, and the display of emotions. Artists like Giambologna and Adriaen de Vries created expressive and highly naturalistic compositions that evoked a sense of drama and theatricality, often engaging a viewer's physical participation through a multiple viewing angles composition. Significant Baroque bronzes in the Frick Collection consist of Pietro Tacca's \\"Moor Captive\\" and Giambologna's \\"Mercury.\\" Step 3: Explain the importance of these bronzes in the broader context of art history The Renaissance and Baroque periods were key eras of innovation and artistic achievement, with bronze sculpture occupying a prominent place in the hearts and minds of collectors and patrons alike. The refinement of lost-wax casting techniques allowed artists to create intricate bronzes that could be collected, prominently displayed, and admired for their technical prowess, ultimately elevating the status of the sculptor to that of a revered artist.  Step 4: Highlight the significance of these works within the Frick Collection The presence of Renaissance and Baroque bronzes in the Frick Collection is further evidence of Henry Clay Frick's passion for collecting the highest quality examples of European art. These works, once reserved for private enjoyment or displayed in princely collections, now delight a public audience, inspiring visitors with their breathtaking detail, grace, and ingenious composition. Their inclusion within the Frick Collection highlights the institution's commitment to sharing exceptional works of art that engage viewers in stimulating dialogues about the history, technique, and beauty of the Western artistic tradition. Conclusion: The Renaissance and Baroque bronze sculptures housed in the Frick Collection are a testament to the mastery and innovation of these distinguished periods in art history. Their intricate details, rich storytelling, and dramatic presence provide an immersive experience for viewers, allowing them to explore the history and lasting influence of these fascinating works. By displaying this exceptional collection, the Frick ensures that the remarkable artistic achievements of the Renaissance and Baroque eras continue to captivate and inspire future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley, his wife, Connie, and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and climbs out of the shaft on his own.

They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\\" spy plane\\" brought down in Chinese territory. The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf. In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness.

The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

Context: Looking to snap a four-game losing streak, the 1-8 Browns flew to Ford Field for a Week 11 interconference duel with the 1-8 Detroit Lions. Both teams began the game with field goals, as Cleveland kicker Phil Dawson made a 44-yard field goal while Lions kicker Jason Hanson got a 31-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Browns' offense exploded as quarterback Brady Quinn completed a 59-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi, a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey, and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Detroit would answer with quarterback Matthew Stafford completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to running back Aaron Brown. The Lions would tie the game in the second quarter as Stafford hooked up with running back Kevin Smith on a 25-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 75-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson. Afterwards, Cleveland would end the half with Dawson nailing a 29-yard field goal. Detroit would take the lead in the third quarter with Stafford's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Will Heller, the Browns would pick up a safety after Stafford was called for intentional grounding from his own end zone. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland regained the lead with Quinn's 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Michael Gaines (followed by running back Jamal Lewis getting a 2-point conversion run). The Lions would take over, and with no time left, Browns safety Brodney Pool intercepted the ball. However, cornerback Hank Poteat was flagged for pass interference in the end zone. Since the game cannot end on a defensive penalty, Detroit was given one un-timed down from the Browns' 1-yard line and Stafford completed the game-winning touchdown pass to tight end Brandon Pettigrew. With the loss in the 1-8 battle, Cleveland fell to 1-9 assuring them that they would finish last in their division. Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown in the first half compared to the shortest? Answer:","output":"In the first half, the longest touchdown was a 75-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, while the shortest touchdown was a 4-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. To find the difference between the longest and shortest touchdowns, subtract the shorter distance from the longer distance: 75 yards (longest touchdown) - 4 yards (shortest touchdown) = 71 yards So the longest touchdown in the first half was 71 yards longer than the shortest touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once the car is covered in thick, foamy suds, the man takes a step back and inspects his work. Satisfied that he has sufficiently cleaned each part of the car, he reaches for the pressure washer once again. This time, the man adjusts the nozzle of the washer to produce a wide, fanning spray pattern, allowing him to gently remove the suds without causing any harm to the car's surface. As he methodically rinses off the soapy residue, the man pays close attention to areas that may be more difficult to clean – such as the wheel arches, side mirrors, and under the bumpers – ensuring that no dirt or grime remains. Once the entire car is thoroughly rinsed, he turns off the pressure washer and sets it aside.  He proceeds to grab a large, high-quality microfiber towel to begin the drying process.

Information:  - The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas.  - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Classical Armenian (\\"grabar\\", Western Armenian \\"krapar\\", meaning \\"literary [language]\\"; also Old Armenian or Liturgical Armenian) is the oldest attested form of the Armenian language. It was first written down at the beginning of the 5th century, and all Armenian literature from then through the 18th century is in Classical Armenian. Many ancient manuscripts originally written in Ancient Greek, Persian, Hebrew, Syriac and Latin survive only in Armenian translation.  - Movses Kaghankatvatsi ( Armenian :   Movses Kaankatvaci ) , or Movses Daskhurantsi (   Movses Dasxuranci ) is the reputed author ( or authors ) of a tenth - century Classical Armenian historiographical work on Caucasian Albania and eastern provinces of Armenia , known as The History of the Country of Albania (   , Patmutiwn Auanic ) .  - Western Armenian (Classical spelling: , \\"arevmdahayerên\\") is one of the two standardized forms of Modern Armenian, the other being Eastern Armenian. Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were spoken in the Ottoman Empire, especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as Western Armenia. Following the extermination of the Armenian population during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 Western Armenian is now spoken, almost exclusively, in the Armenian diaspora communities around the world. As a diasporic language, and as a language that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries. Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian at less than one million.  - Albania (Latin: ', Greek: , in Old Armenian:  \\"Auank\\" (\\"Aguank\\"), Parthian: \\"Ardhan\\", Middle Persian: \\"Arran\\"); usually referred to as Caucasian Albania\\"' for disambiguation with the modern state of Albania (the native name for the country is unknown), is a name for the historical region of the eastern Caucasus, that existed on the territory of present-day republic of Azerbaijan (where both of its capitals were located) and partially southern Dagestan. Around the first centuries BC and AD the land south of the Greater Caucasus and north of the Lesser Caucasus was divided between Kolchis in the west, Caucasian Iberia in the center and Caucasian Albania in the east. To the southwest was Armenia and to the southeast Atropatene.  - The Armenian language (\\"\\") is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora.

It has a population of 3.03 million as of 2016. Tirana is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Durrës and Vlorë. Albania is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula, bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia.

Given the question: Question: \\"Why do insects want to be pollinators?\\"  Context: \\"Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Insects are attracted to becoming pollinators due to the mutualistic relationship that has developed between them and the plants they pollinate. This relationship benefits both parties involved - the insects gain access to valuable resources, such as nectar and pollen, while the plants receive assistance in their reproductive process. In this context, there are several reasons why insects would want to be pollinators. 1. Nutritional benefits: For insects like bees, butterflies, and some beetles, the primary motivation behind pollination is acquiring energy-rich nectar. This sugary fluid provides insects with the essential nutrients they need to maintain their metabolism, including carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. In addition, pollen often serves as an essential source of proteins, fats, and vitamins for pollinators like bees. Thus, becoming a pollinator helps insects attain nourishment essential for their survival. 2. Evolutionary advantages: Over time, insects have evolved various behavioral, sensory, and morphological adaptations that align well with the traits of certain plant species. For example, some flowers have specific shapes and colors that attract particular pollinators or emit specific scents that lure them. Insects have also evolved specialized structures, such as the proboscis in moths and butterflies, that allow them to access nectar more efficiently. By becoming pollinators, insects can exploit these adaptations to secure access to more valuable food resources, which in turn enhances their fitness and survival prospects. 3. Reproductive success: Some insect species rely on plant materials for their reproductive process. For example, the female yucca moth lays her eggs in the flowers of the yucca plant and collects pollen to form a ball. She then deposits this pollen ball onto the stigma of the yucca flower, which ensures that her offspring will have a food source when they hatch. Thus, engaging in pollination activities can benefit insects by increasing the likelihood of reproductive success for their offspring. 4. Habitat diversity: Many insects are habitat specialists and require specific types of flowers or plants in their environment to survive. Becoming pollinators helps these insects maintain their preferred habitat by ensuring plant reproduction and the continuation of floral resources. 5. Co-evolution: The co-evolution of plants and insects has led to the development of specialized interactions and dependencies, which often involve unique adaptations on both sides. For example, plants have evolved ways to provide incentives to the insects visiting their flowers, such as special types of nectar, scents, and ultraviolet markers, which improve the likelihood of their species’ pollen being transferred. In turn, insects have evolved bodily features that equip them to access and collect these floral rewards. This delicate partnership reinforces the reasons why insects would want to be pollinators, as it minimizes competition for resources and promotes survival. Overall, insects want to be pollinators due to the array of ecological, evolutionary, and reproductive benefits they gain from this mutualistic relationship. By partaking in pollination, insects not only obtain vital resources for their survival and welfare, but they also play a crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem's stability and biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him?, what is it ?

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Wi-fi is super convenient, and it might be the way to go for your handheld devices, like your phone or tablet. But some studies indicate that by using wireless Internet, you could be reducing your speed as much as 30%. Older routers could suffer from outdated components that might be limiting your access to the data for which you're paying. Routers range from the ultra-expensive to the bare-bones basic, which could range in cost from 20 to over 10,000. For most home users, a router in the 20 to 50 dollar range should be sufficient for your Internet needs. Wireless boosters and directional antennas can salvage wasted data by either directing wireless data in a more concentrated fashion or by making it easier for your computer to pick up the wireless signal. Decide if one is right for your situation by searching \\"wireless signal boosters\\" or \\"wireless directional antennas\\" online. Many modems are provided by your ISP for a small monthly rental fee, but rental fees stack up and sometimes the modem you are renting is less than optimal. Do an Internet search of which modem will work best with your Internet connection, and if you find the one provided to be lacking, upgrade to a newer model. Some experts suggest you upgrade your modem every three years to guarantee maximum efficiency. Running technology for long periods of time can create a backlog of errors, recorded files, updates, and it can put strain on it from the constant usage. Though this isn't guaranteed to improve your Internet speed, resetting your router and modem weekly can have a noticeable improve Internet speed. If you are using an older computer or device, your internet speed issues might simply be the result of outdated technology, insufficient RAM, or inadequate processing power. A new, fully updated device, might be the only way to improve your speed if this is the case. Moving your device closer to your wireless router, in the event you are using wireless for your device, can significantly improve your signal strength and speed. Walls, furniture, or household items might be interfering with or absorbing your wi-fi signal, and a small move can sometimes make a big difference in speed. Re-positioning your router might also be a good idea, especially if signal strength is an issue with your Internet. If several users in your household are using the Internet at the same time, the max Internet speed being provided to you will be divided among the devices. Even if you aren't directly using your phone or tablet, leaving those devices on and connected to the Internet can steal precious bandwidth from you, slowing down your speed.","output":"Wi-Fi is a way to connect devices like phones and tablets to the internet without using wires.

It's good to change modems every three years. Turning off your router and modem once a week might make the internet work better. If you have an old computer, it might be slow because it's old. Getting closer to the Wi-Fi router can help with internet speed. Sometimes, things in your house can block the Wi-Fi signal, so you might need to move the router or your device.

Apple Computer Inc. has updated the software for some of its iPod digital media players so that songs bought from RealNetworks Inc.","output":"This information you provided likely pertains to a dispute that happened between Apple Inc. and RealNetworks Inc. in the mid-2000s, where both companies stood differently over issues of digital copyright, interoperability, and competition in the digital music industry. It was all about the incompatibility of music files bought from RealNetworks' online music store to play on Apple's iPod. In a nutshell, Apple's iPod music players were designed to work directly with iTunes, Apple's own music store. Initially, songs bought from other digital music retailers, including RealNetworks' Harmony store, were not compatible with the iPod, because the music files were DRM protected, meaning that their digital rights management encryption was not readable by the iPod's operating system. In 2004, RealNetworks launched what they called their \\"Harmony technology\\", stating that it could make their music compatible with the iPod. Essentially, RealNetworks reverse-engineered Apple's FairPlay DRM system without Apple's consent—kind of creating a digital ‘universal translator’, which allowed songs bought from RealNetworks to be translated into a format that could be played on the iPod. Apple, for its part, resisted this move, as it saw it as an intrusion into its proprietary technology. They argued that by reverse-engineering their DRM, RealNetworks was in essence hacking their system. This led to Apple updating its iPod software to block the Harmony technology, thereby once again rendering songs purchased from RealNetworks incompatible. This effectively locked out all the other digital music stores from the iPod, securing iTunes’ dominance over the iPod's music ecosystem. This resulted in somewhat of a public relations fight between the two companies. RealNetworks accused Apple of being anti-competitive, whereas Apple retorted that RealNetworks had adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker. This entire episode is frequently pointed to as a key moment that accentuated the debates about digital copyright, interoperability, and anti-competitive practices. It also ended up pushing more talks about DRM-free music, which eventually became the standard for most digital music retailers, including both iTunes and RealNetworks, towards the end of the 2000s. Such DRM-free music files could be played on any device that supports the standard music file types, thereby resolving the issue of interoperability at least somewhat. So, when you mention Apple updating its software so that songs bought from RealNetworks won't play, you are probably talking about that period of time known for its so-called 'digital music wars'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states that a Church of England priest has caused a controversy by arguing that it's acceptable to shoplift from chain supermarkets due to their detrimental effect on local businesses. The hypothesis proposes that the priest was excommunicated from the Church of England because of his statement. Step 2: Determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To do this, we need to analyze if the premise provides enough information to conclude that the hypothesis is true or false. In other words, can we infer from the premise that the priest was excommunicated because of his statement? Step 3: Analyze the premise for relevant information. The premise provides information on the priest's controversial statement and highlights that it has caused a furor. However, it does not indicate any specific consequences or actions taken by the Church of England in response to the priest's argument. Step 4: Evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis.

First he visited Australia, a country which respected the environment and produced zero air pollution, and New Zealand, a country which based its economy on burning fossil fuels and generated a lot of air pollution.  But I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  What is an answer for this question: Which country had fewer people with increased chances of dying from other diseases? A:","output":"In light of the information provided, it can be deduced that Australia had fewer people with increased chances of dying from other diseases.  The reasoning behind this deduction is anchored in the role played by air pollution in health risks and specifically the potential for air pollution to lead to illnesses that can be fatal. Air pollution, as mentioned in the background information, significantly increases the risk of developing severe health conditions, such as asthma and lung cancer, as well as increasing the likelihood of death from other diseases.  Moreover, the background information also asserts that air pollution is particularly detrimental to children who are more affected by polluted air since their lungs are still developing and growing. This demographic would be at a higher risk in countries where air pollution is abundant. In the contrasting situation between the two countries Manny visited, Australia is described as a country that respects the environment and produces zero air pollution. This could signify that the air quality in Australia is healthier and less detrimental to its inhabitants' health. Hence, the likelihood of persistent exposure to harmful air pollutants in Australia is significantly less. Consequently, fewer people would have increased chances of dying from various diseases attributable to air pollution. On the contrary, New Zealand is depicted as a country that bases its economy on burning fossil fuels, which we know generates a considerable amount of air pollution. This situation implies that the people living there have a higher chance of being continuously exposed to unhealthy air, thus increasing their likelihood of developing serious health conditions and potentially dying from other diseases. To summarize, based on the information provided, Australia, with its zero air pollution, would logically have fewer people with increased chances of dying from diseases compared to New Zealand, where the level of air pollution—due in large part to its economic reliance on burning fossil fuels—is presumably higher. However, it is worth mentioning that these conclusions are highly hypothetical and should be supported by proper research or empirical evidence."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Open today's newspaper.
