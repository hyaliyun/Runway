Does it follow that \\"The EPA considered the future compliance costs.\\"? Options: [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","output":"[I] Yes The statement \\"The EPA considered the future compliance costs\\" is likely accurate based on the assertion \\"As discussed previously, EPA considered the future compliance costs in assessing the impact of the rule.\\" In this circumstance, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is clarifying that in its decision-making process, it contemplated future compliance costs while evaluating the rule's impact. The mention of future compliance costs denotes any expenses that regulated entities might incur in the future related to satisfying the requirements of the rule under discussion. These costs could encompass various things, such as expenses for new equipment, increased operational costs, or even potential fees or penalties for non-compliance. It's crucial to keep in mind that cost assessment, such as considering future compliance costs, plays a pivotal role in the decision-making process of implementing new rules or changing existing ones. Before implementing any new rules, EPA evaluates the anticipated environmental, economic, and social effects to ensure that the system balances both environmental protection and economic sustainability. The mention \\"as discussed previously\\" implies that this isn't the first time the matter is addressed. This aspect can suggest that the EPA has an established procedure for considering future compliance costs when assessing the impact of a rule.  Overall, it's clear that the EPA is mindful of the potential economic effects of its rules and takes these into consideration in its decision-making processes. This particular statement indicates a comprehensive appraisal of potential outcomes; it implies a careful balancing of environmental protection needs against the potential financial burden that could be imposed on those required to comply with the rule.  Thus, in this context, it definitely follows that \\"The EPA considered the future compliance costs\\" as a part of the impact assessment of the rule. The EPA has considered not only the environmental impacts of the rule but also the costs that businesses will have to bear in the future to comply with the rule.

Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: ['n@re:ndr@ da:mo:d@r'da:s 'mo:di:] ( listen); born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 16th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi's candidature, including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were \\"concerned with their personal agendas\\". Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's election campaign. Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party. The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign. The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.  During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat. Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about \\"development,\\" without focus on any specific policies. His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism. Prior to the election Modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development. Although the BJP avoided issues of Hindu nationalism to an extent, Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign. The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. Modi's campaign blitz cost approximately Rs50 billion (US770 million), and received extensive financial support from corporate donors. In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media, and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances.  The BJP won 31% of the vote, and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP, as was the support from the RSS. In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims. The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing. Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.  Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara. He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes. Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India's president. To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: where did he do his campaigning?","output":"Narendra Modi did his campaigning in various parts of India.

As political comebacks go, Nawaz Sharif's is among the more remarkable. He served two terms as Pakistan's prime minister in the 1990s before he was overthrown in a military coup and banished into the political hinterlands. After a Pakistani court sentenced him to life in prison for hijacking and terrorism, he managed to negotiate his way into exile in Saudi Arabia, where he remained for seven years, waiting for the political tides to shift and allow his return. On Wednesday, he completed his long journey back to power and became prime minister for an unprecedented third term. The Pakistani National Assembly, where his political party secured control in elections last month, elected him prime minister with 244 votes. Later Wednesday, he took the oath of office from President Asif Ali Zardari, one of his longtime political rivals whose term ends later this year. Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had been in government since 2008. This year, it became the first elected administration in the country's history to successfully see out a full term in office and hand over power democratically. But that milestone didn't help the PPP at the ballot box last month. Following a term plagued by corruption allegations, militant violence, economic torpor and power shortages, its support fell away in an election marred by extremist attacks on candidates. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, on the other hand, performed strongly, capitalizing on his image as a flag-bearer for private industry and entrepreneurship with promises to revive the country's economic fortunes. Stern challenges. Now, as he takes the reins of government again, he will have to face up to Pakistan's raft of daunting challenges. His economic stewardship will be quickly put to the test. Analysts say Sharif, the scion of an industrial family and one of the country's richest people, has typically favored large, showy infrastructure projects such as highways as a way to spur economic activity. But with Pakistani's public finances in a fragile state, finding the funds for big building plans could prove difficult, observers say. He also has the complex task of resolving the country's energy crisis, which has resulted in prolonged power outages that hurt businesses and sometimes provoke street protests. The security situation in the country remains a severe problem, as the widespread attacks during the elections by the Pakistani Taliban and other extremists showed. Sharif has floated the idea of holding talks with the Taliban, but some analysts say the country's powerful military, with whom Sharif has clashed in the past, will hold the final word on key security and foreign policy decisions. Stance on drones? Until Wednesday, when he called for an end to drone strikes, his stance on the United States' unpopular program in Pakistan's tribal areas that border Afghanistan was unclear. \\"The campaign of drone strikes should be shut down,\\" Sharif said in his acceptance speech. \\"We must work together to ensure Pakistan's sovereignty.\\" Imran Khan, the former cricket star whose young party has become one of the main opposition groups in parliament, has called on Sharif to bring an end to the U.S. program. Sharif has condemned drone strikes in the past, including the one last week that killed the Pakistani Taliban's No. 2 leader. But analysts say he had good working relations with the United States during his previous terms in office and is likely to take a similarly pragmatic approach once back in power. He has said he will pursue closer ties with Pakistan's neighbor and archrival, India. During his second term as prime minister, in the late 1990s, Sharif oversaw Pakistan's emergence as a nuclear power, for which many Pakistanis still hold him in high regard. It remains to be seen what his third term will be remembered for. CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article talks about Nawaz Sharif, a man who has become Pakistan's prime minister for a third time after being away from that position for many years. He was once thrown out of the job by military people, had to go live in another country (Saudi Arabia) because he got into trouble in Pakistan, and then came back to his home country when things started to get better for him. His political party, called Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, did really well in the elections, and people liked him because he promised to help businesses grow and make the country richer. But now that he's in charge again, he has to deal with other big problems Pakistan faces, like not having enough electricity, feeling unsafe because of bad people doing violent things, and trying to work well with other countries like the United States and India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although this single-word sentence may be considered simplistic and lacking explicit context, we can still deduce the general sentiment by examining the meaning, connotations, and typical associations of the word \\"radiant.\\" \\"Radiant\\" is an adjective that typically describes something or someone that emits light or is characterized by brightness. It can also refer to someone's glowing or beaming appearance, often prompted by their joy, energy, or vitality.

In a more figurative sense, \\"radiant\\" can be used to portray an individual who is emanating happiness, positivity, or confidence. It may also convey a sense of optimism or hopefulness, as the word's associations with light often parallel the concept of overcoming darkness or challenges. Given these various contexts and connotations, it would be reasonable to assume that the sentiment of the sentence containing the word \\"radiant\\" is positive.

Hurt people Bullying and the use of mean words can have a significant impact on others, primarily causing emotional distress and hurt. When someone uses hurtful language or behaves aggressively, it can lead to people feeling sad, vulnerable, or unwanted, dramatically affecting their self-esteem. The environment in which the bullying occurs can also be negatively impacted, fostering fear and discomfort among bystanders or other individuals within the vicinity. Often, people who witness or are subjected to bullying and mean words face psychological and emotional repercussions, with long-term effects that go beyond the immediate moment. These experiences can lead to decreased confidence, increased anxiety, and sometimes even depression or suicidal thoughts. In some cases, victims or witnesses might also retaliate, potentially leading to escalated situations and more significant conflict.  Moreover, the bully's mean words can also cause a ripple effect within the community. Bullying can contribute to a toxic environment, whether it takes place in a school, a workplace, or a social setting. When destructive behavior becomes commonplace, it can result in decreased morale, reduced productivity, and even a decline in mental and physical well-being among those affected.

This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs. Answer:","output":"The right claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation was the right to present the rector for St Botolph's Church in Quarrington. This right was previously held by the Abbey in the 13th century before being claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln in the early 16th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks. Answer:","output":"Walter Raleigh"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities??  The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in ancient Egyptian the Ba of Neferirkare) was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai – referred to as Neferirkare – in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's  death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Grade was born in Tokmak, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire to Isaak and Olga Winogradsky. In 1912, when Grade was six, the Jewish family emigrated to escape Cossack violence and anti-Semitism, from Odessa via Berlin to Brick Lane in Bethnal Green in the East End of London. Isaak worked as a trouser-presser while his three sons (Grade and his younger brothers, Bernard (later Bernard Delfont) and Leslie) attended the Rochelle Street Elementary School near Shoreditch, where Yiddish was spoken by 90% of the pupils. For two years the Winogradskys lived in rented rooms at the north end of Brick Lane, before moving to the nearby Boundary Estate. At the age of 15, Grade became an agent for a clothing company, and shortly afterwards started his own business. In 1926, he was declared Charleston Champion of the World at a dancing competition at the Royal Albert Hall. Fred Astaire was one of the judges. Grade subsequently became a professional dancer going by the name Louis Grad; this form came from a Paris reporter's typing error that Grade liked and decided to keep. Decades later, the then octogenarian Lord Grade once danced the Charleston at a party Arthur Ochs Sulzberger gave in New York.  Signed as a dancer by Joe Collins (father of Jackie and Joan Collins) in 1931, around 1934, Grade went into partnership with him and became a talent agent in their company Collins & Grade. Among their earliest clients were the harmonica player Larry Adler and the jazz group Quintet of the Hot Club of France.  Following the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, Grade became involved in arranging entertainment for soldiers in Harrogate, and later joined the British Army. He was discharged after two years when an old problem with swelling of the knees, which had earlier ended his dancing career, recurred. In 1945, the arrangement with Collins having been terminated, Grade formed a partnership with his brother Leslie (Lew and Leslie Grade Ltd., or the Grade Organisation). That year, the brothers traveled in the United States, where they developed their entertainment interests. His connections included, among others, Bob Hope and Judy Garland, who performed in Britain for the first time. The brothers became the main bookers of artists for the London Palladium in 1948, then managed by Val Parnell for the Moss Empires Group owned by the family of Prince Littler.","output":"This text is about Grade, also known as Louis Grad, who was born in the Russian Empire and later moved with his family to London.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy.

When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman.

Atlanta","output":"Title: Southern Justice: The Bowden Clause Plot: Step One: Setting the scene and character introduction Our movie starts off in bustling Atlanta, Georgia - a city with a intriguing blend of southern charm and cosmopolitan allure. This is the town where Sam Bowden, our protagonist, practices law. He's not a high-profile lawyer, frequently involved in minor cases, but highly respected for his tenacity, ethics and belief in justice.  Reasoning: The introduction helps establish the environment and the main character, in line with user's request. This also helps create initial connection between the audience and the plot. Step Two: Establishing conflict Sam has always led a low-profile life, choosing cases that meant something to him, instead of the ones that could make him wealthy. Trouble runs his way when he is compelled to take up a case involving corruption in high level politics in the city. The antagonist, a powerful politician named Jim Lockhart who is known for his unscrupulous ways, becomes his opponent. Reasoning: Every good plot needs a conflict. In this case, by putting Sam, a humble lawyer, against a powerful politician provides a compelling plot involving justice against corruption. Step Three: The Middle Act  Despite the risks, Sam is resolved to seek the truth and bring justice. His investigation leads him through a web of power, deceit, and mystery; he discovers a bribery scandal that threatens to destabilize the city. Along the way, he's supported by Ellie, a fearless journalist who believes in Sam's cause. Reasoning: Further developing the plot, we add another character, the female lead. This step adds layers to the plot and supports character development. Step Four: Climax As Sam and Ellie dig deeper, they stumble upon an assassination plot to silence the ones who oppose Jim. At a major public gathering, Sam exposes Jim with concrete evidence putting his life at risk. A tense situation arises leading to a thrilling showdown. Reasoning: The climax is the turning point, usually most intense part of the story. A public denouement adds to the drama. Step Five: Conclusion In the end, Sam manages to expose Jim Lockhart's schemes. Justice prevails, and he becomes an overnight hero. Though the victory is bittersweet, as he has made several enemies, he remains steadfast and committed to his ethos, ready to face whatever comes next. Reasoning: Concluding the movie plot in line with the theme, with our lawyer ensuring justice, provides a satisfactory resolution. \\"Southern Justice: The Bowden Clause” is an engaging legal thriller, symbolizing the fight against corruption.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas? , can you please find it?   The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 million years ago at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September...

Marquise Byrd was riding in the front seat as a passenger Tuesday night when the sandbag hit the car heading south on Interstate 75. The driver of the car wasn't hurt, but Byrd suffered a serious head injury and was treated at the scene by emergency responders before being taken to an area hospital. Police told a local prosecutor that Byrd may die from his injuries, reports the Toledo Blade. As for the youths accused of tossing the sandbag, one is a 13-year-old and three are 14. All four were charged with felonious assault and booked into the Lucas County Juvenile Detention Center. People notes they're not being charged as adults and so won't name them, though the Blade does; two of them reportedly have previous criminal infractions. Authorities say other cars were hit with other objects, meaning more charges may emerge, including vandalism or homicide if Byrd dies from his injuries. The bridge the sandbag was thrown from is being renovated, and so sections of fence that normally would prevent anyone from being able to drop anything over the side are missing. The sandbag may have been left by contractors overnight to weigh down items like signage.

Physical harm to the driver of the vehicle was luckily avoided, but, sadly, Byrd sustained a serious head injury. First responders treated him at the scene of the incident before moving him to a nearby hospital for further treatment. Local law enforcement officials indicated to a local prosecutor that Byrd's injuries could lead to his death. On the subject of culpability, four teenagers are currently in custody in connection with the incident. Among them, one teenager is thirteen years of age, while the other three are fourteen. The boys are currently being held at the Lucas County Juvenile Detention Center, all having been charged with felonious assault in connection with the incident. The publication People has declined to disclose the identities of the alleged perpetrators, due to the fact they are not being charged as adults. In contrast, the Toledo Blade chose to publish their names. It is reported that at least two of the defendants have had previous encounters with the law.  There are indications that more charges can be pressed against the juvenile suspects, as it seems other cars were targeted with different objects. Depending on the outcome of Byrd's health situation, possible charges could range from vandalism to homicide.  Interestingly, this incident is related to maintenance works being conducted on the overpass from which the sandbag was thrown. The bridge is currently under renovation and as a result, portions of the protective fence, which prevents objects from being thrown onto the road, are missing. It is speculated that the sandbag used in the attack could have been left overnight by contractors, who were using them to weigh down signage. The Ohio Department of Transportation issued a statement about the dangers of tossing items onto moving vehicles, stating even a lightweight item could inflict significant damage if it were to hit a vehicle moving at high speed. Such \\"mischief\\" on overpasses cannot be taken lightly, considering the potential life-threatening harm it can cause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off.  Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… Question: What does the blogger probably like to do while traveling to new cities?

News article: Millions could die as world unprepared for pandemics, says UN A global epidemic far worse than the Ebola outbreak is a real possibility and could kill many millions if the world does not become better prepared to deal with the sudden emergence and transmission of disease, the UN has said in a hard-hitting report. The report has emerged in draft form, as experts rally to deal with the rapid spread of the Zika virus across Latin America, which has been linked to thousands of cases of brain damage in babies. Countries in the region have again been caught off-guard because of the lack of scientific knowledge about the virus and the absence of good data on microcephaly, a condition in which babies’ heads fail to grow properly in the womb. The report comes from the high-level panel on the global response to health crises, set up by the UN secretary general in April 2015, as the Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people finally waned. Several other inquiries into what occurred, and the slow and inadequate response by the World Health Organisation (WHO), have reported and fed into the UN panel’s conclusions. Too often, global panic about epidemics has been followed by complacency and inaction “The high risk of major health crises is widely underestimated, and … the world’s preparedness and capacity to respond is woefully insufficient. Future epidemics could far exceed the scale and devastation of the west Africa Ebola outbreak,” says the panel’s chair, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete from Tanzania, outlining their findings in the preface. “Too often, global panic about epidemics has been followed by complacency and inaction. For example, the 2009 influenza pandemic prompted a similar review of global preparedness, but most of its recommendations were not addressed. Had they been implemented, thousands of lives could have been saved in west Africa. We owe it to the victims to prevent a recurrence of this tragedy.” The report, which has been posted online in advanced, unedited form in the UN’s Daily Journal, is not just about the mishandling of Ebola, but about the crucial need for the world to put in place systems to detect and fight new disease threats. “Notwithstanding its devastating impact in west Africa, the Ebola virus is not the most virulent pathogen known to humanity,” says the report. “Mathematical modelling by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has shown that a virulent strain of an airborne influenza virus could spread to all major global capitals within 60 days and kill more than 33 million people within 250 days.” Other diseases that have recently caused widespread suffering include four major outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea, the pandemics of avian and swine flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). “These all serve as stark reminder of the threat to humanity posed by emerging communicable diseases,” says the report. The panel says surveillance and response to outbreaks must be led by the WHO, but the key role should be played by a centre for emergency preparedness and response. The centre “must have real command and control capacity”, says the report, and it should have the best technology available to identify, track and respond to an emerging threat. The report also says countries must report on their state of compliance to WHO every year and must be regularly reviewed. All countries must give the WHO more money, says the report – an increase of at least 10% in their funding. In addition, they must put 300m for a contingency fund for emergencies, not 100m as recently set up. A further fund worth 1bn must be set up for the development of vaccines, drugs and testing equipment. Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: “Epidemic and pandemic diseases are among the greatest of all threats to human health and security, against which we have for too long done too little to prepare. After four inquiries into the preventable tragedy of Ebola, there is now a strong consensus about what must be done. The WHO’s leadership and member states must make 2016 the year of decision and act now to build a more resilient global health system. “As the UN panel and the other inquiries recommend, the cornerstones of better health security must be a strong, independent WHO centre to lead outbreak preparedness and response, new mechanisms and financing for developing vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for potential epidemic threats, strong community engagement and investment in basic health infrastructure in every country, not just those that can afford it.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. A hard-hitting UN report warns that a global epidemic far worse than the Ebola outbreak is a real possibility and could kill millions if the world does not improve its preparedness and ability to deal with the emergence and transmission of diseases. 2.

He noticed that the kettle was clean and free from rust, thus deeming it safe to use. Step 2: Fill the kettle with water Vincent fetched fresh water from the tap and carefully filled the kettle, being cautious not to spill any water. He filled the kettle with enough water to cover the amount of spaghetti he planned to cook. Step 3: Boil the water He placed the kettle on the stove and switched on the heat to a high setting, aiming for a rapid boil. In choosing this method over the rusty pot, he eliminated any risk of rusty residue in the pasta water. Step 4: Monitor the boiling water While waiting for the water to boil, Vincent stayed close by, keeping an eye on the kettle to ensure it didn't boil over or encounter any issues. Step 5: Prepare the spaghetti While the water was heating, he took the opportunity to measure out the desired amount of spaghetti for his meal. He separated the strands and broke them in half, ready to be cooked.

Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop.  Guess a valid title for it!

Each character has their own reason for participating in the heist, whether it be for survival, entertainment, or to regain a sense of self-worth. Step 3: Creating the title The first part of the title, \\"Breaking Bonds,\\" suggests that the characters are breaking free from the constraints of their circumstances and forming new connections with each other. The second part, \\"The Pawn Shop Heist,\\" makes it clear that the film revolves around a heist taking place in a pawn shop.

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What can overexposure to vibrating matter cause?\\" and the following answer choices:  - symptoms  - hypothyroidism  - Pollution  - hyperthyroidism  - Damaged hearing  - Electrical energy  - Relieve pain  - decrease stamina  Now knowing that matter vibrating can cause sound and overexposure to sound can damage hearing, choose the best answer. The answer is:","output":"Damaged hearing Overexposure to vibrating matter is most commonly associated with the generation of sound. Sound is a form of mechanical energy that travels through a medium, usually air, as longitudinal waves. These waves are produced by the rapid vibration of matter which then transfers that energy to neighboring molecules, causing them to vibrate as well. When a person is exposed to loud sounds for an extended period of time, these vibrations can cause damage to the delicate structures within their ears, specifically in the inner ear where the mechanosensory hair cells are responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that the brain interprets as sound. These hair cells are extremely sensitive, and if they are subjected to excessive vibrations, or loud sounds, they can become permanently damaged or destroyed. This damage can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, depending on the extent of the damage and the individual's susceptibility. Among the answer choices provided, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism refer to conditions related to the thyroid gland, which is not associated with sound exposure. Pollution, while a significant environmental concern, is not a direct consequence of exposure to vibrating matter. Electrical energy is not related to vibrating matter or sound exposure, and relieving pain is an unrelated effect. Decrease stamina is also not a direct result of overexposure to vibrating matter, but could be a symptom of another underlying issue. Thus, \\"damaged hearing\\" is the best and most accurate answer.  It is important to recognize and understand the risks associated with exposure to loud sounds and take appropriate steps to protect one's hearing, such as wearing earplugs in noisy environments or keeping the volume of headphones or speakers at a safe level. Preventing damage to one's hearing can help preserve the ability to communicate effectively, enjoy music and other sounds, and maintain overall quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A network rep claims that the decision to not move forward with the animated comedy came before an anonymous woman alleged that the former 'Silicon Valley' star sexually assaulted her in 2001.      Comedy Central has canceled T.J. Miller's animated series The Gorburger Show after one season.      News of the cancellation came Tuesday, the same day the former Silicon Valley star was accused of sexual assault and violence by an anonymous woman in a Daily Beast story, though a rep for the network claims that the decision to not move forward with a second season of the show predated the allegations, with one source noting it happened in July. The woman alleges that while she and Miller were seeing each other in college at George Washington University in 2001, the actor strangled her and punched her in the mouth during sex. She also said he penetrated her anally without her consent, and later did the same with a beer bottle.      Miller has denied the claims, writing in a statement with his wife, Kate, that the woman is \\"using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations.\\" The married couple added that they think it is \\"unfortunate that she is choosing this route as it undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators.

The actor-comedian voiced the host of the show, a giant blue space monster who has invaded a Japanese morning talk show and held its staff hostage as he attempts to understand what it means to be human by interviewing celebrities and musical artists. Guests included Rob Corddry, Larry King, Tig Notaro, Drew Pinsky and Reggie Watts.      The alien puppet talk show was created by Ryan K. McNeal and Josh Martin, with the pair writing, directing and executive producing the comedy alongside Sean Boyle for Funny or Die. The Gorburger Show previously ran for two seasons and 19 episodes on Funny or Die before moving to HBO as a pilot in 2015 and eventually landing at the Viacom-owned network earlier this year.      Elsewhere, Miller has a number of films coming up. Among them: Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One, DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon 3, Kristen Stewart starrer Underwater and Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool 2. Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox declined to comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, DreamWorks and Underwater producer Chernin Entertainment did not respond to requests for comment.      Miller made headlines when he abruptly left Silicon Valley, the breakout HBO comedy on which he played fan-favorite Erlich Bachman for four seasons. In a wide-ranging exit interview with The Hollywood Reporter at the time, Miller took shots at executive producer Alec Berg (\\"I don't know how smart [Alec] is. He went to Harvard, and we all know those kids are fucking idiots. That Crimson trash\\") and star Thomas Middleditch (\\"I'm not sitting here saying, 'I need more lines. I'm not funny enough.'

An alleged victim of former Silicon Valley star T.J. Miller is coming forward with accusations that Miller hit and sexually assaulted her while in college.      The accusations were eventually addressed by a student court at George Washington University and have been buzzed about in Hollywood and stand-up circles for years.      “He just tried a lot of things without asking me, and at no point asked me if I was all right,” the woman told The Daily Beast. “He choke[d] me, and I kept staring at his face hoping he would see that I was afraid and [that he] would stop… I couldn’t say anything.”      Miller’s alleged victim, who asked to remain anonymous, said she is coming forward now in part because of the societal awakening to issues of sexual assault and harassment that has come in the aftermath of misconduct allegations that have rocked the entertainment industry. The Daily Beast is withholding her identity because of her fears of retribution. But for the purposes of this piece, we will call her Sarah.      Miller has told friends over the years that he was wrongfully accused. And in a statement to The Daily Beast, Miller and his wife, Kate, denied any wrongdoing. Instead, they cast themselves as the victims.      Sarah “began again to circulate rumors online once [my and Kate’s] relationship became public. Sadly she is now using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations again,” the Millers wrote. “It is unfortunate that she is choosing this route as it undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators.”      “ Miller began ‘shaking [her] violently’ and punched her in the mouth during sex. ”      But it’s not just Sarah who has come forward. The Daily Beast has corroborated details of her story—which includes two separate incidents—with five GW contemporaries and spoke to numerous associates of both her and Miller.      Two of the GW contemporaries say they were in the off-campus house where the incidents allegedly occurred. The contemporaries later testified in student court about hearing the sound of violent thuds or seeing bruises on Sarah.      Three other contemporaries said they comforted and counseled Sarah in the aftermath of the incidents. Matt Lord was one of them. An ex-boyfriend of Sarah’s, he told The Daily Beast that he continues to believe her story more than a decade after the fact.      “I attended George Washington University for undergraduate studies from 2000 until December 2003... I had a romantic relationship with [this] woman, who spoke with me about T.J. Miller sexually assaulting her,” Lord, who currently works as an attorney in Montague, Massachusetts, wrote in a statement to The Daily Beast. “At the time I believed the statements she made regarding the assault by Mr. Miller, and I continue to believe the statements she made are true. She was engaged in student conduct proceedings regarding the sexual assault, and I remember the emotional toll that the assault and the subsequent conduct hearings placed on her.”      In the years since, Miller has attempted to address the lingering allegations by occasionally making light of them. He’s privately joked about committing violence against a woman in his past, according to three sources in the comedy world. Perhaps that is why some female performers and comedy professionals tell The Daily Beast that they have declined to work with Miller, citing a perceived history of abusive behavior.      The incidents took place at GW where Miller was a student and Sarah was taking classes but not matriculating. They fell in with the same GW comedy troupe, receSs, during which time they struck up a relationship. “I felt relatively safe with T.J. at the time,” Sarah explained.      But months into their relationship, which started in the fall of 2001, Sarah said the first troubling encounter took place. She recalled having “a lot to drink” and admitted that there are “parts of [the incident] I don’t remember.” She stressed that “it is important to me to cop to that… [and] I’m not interested in forcing a pretend memory on anyone… 15 years later, I remain terrified of accusing someone of something they didn’t do, but I have a visual and physical memory of that.”      However, Sarah said she has a distinct memory that as they were “fooling around” at her place, Miller began “shaking me violently” and punched her in the mouth during sex.      Sarah said that she woke up the following morning with a fractured tooth and a bloodied lip. When she asked Miller about it that morning, he claimed, according to Sarah, that she had simply fallen down drunkenly the past evening.      She was unsettled by the incident, but said that she did not know many people in D.C. and continued to see Miller. She had lost her virginity to him and, at least for a brief window, he was someone she trusted.      “ I couldn’t bring myself [at the time] to believe this had happened... It was me not wanting it to be true. ”      “I couldn’t bring myself [at the time] to believe this had happened,” Sarah said. “It was me not wanting it to be true.”      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

She was upset and disappointed and said that she called Miller to confide in him. She had not fully processed the first encounter, she said, and Miller was still someone she believed she could turn to in a time of stress and vulnerability.      They soon met at a college party, and left in a cab to head back to the apartment she had been renting with her roommates. When they arrived back at her home, they began to engage in consensual sex—but then Miller became violent again, Sarah said. She emphasized that she had not had more than two drinks that evening, and that her memory of the following “five-hour” ordeal was and is “crystal-clear.”      “We started to fool around, and very early in that, he put his hands around my throat and closed them, and I couldn’t breathe,” she recalled. “I was genuinely terrified and completely surprised. I understand now that this is for some people a kink, and I continue to believe it is [something] that should be entered into by consenting parties. But, as someone who had only begun having sexual encounters, like, about three months earlier, I had no awareness this was a kink, and I had certainly not entered into any agreement that I would be choked.      “I was fully paralyzed,” Sarah continued.      Sarah claimed that she was “choking audibly”—to the point that her roommates could hear what was happening and rushed over to knock on her bedroom door. Sarah said she then got up and walked to her door in a robe, and one of her roommates asked if everything was OK.      “I don’t know,” she responded, before shutting the door, “I’ll talk to you in the morning.”      “He pulled me back to bed and more things happened,” Sarah said. “He anally penetrated me without my consent, which I actually believe at that point I cried out, like, ‘No,’ and he didn’t continue to do that—but he also had a [beer] bottle with him the entire time. He used the bottle at one point to penetrate me without my consent.”      During the incident, Sarah said she “froze.” She says she “wasn’t prepared” for what had happened and that she “didn’t want to believe it was happening.”      Miller finally left her apartment around 5 a.m. The next morning, Sarah said she confided in her roommates about what had happened. One of those housemates, who is currently a Maryland resident and stay-at-home mom who asked not to be named in this story, confirmed as much to The Daily Beast.      “I knew T.J. was in her bedroom and I was in my bedroom, which was a wall away,” the source said. “My [other] roommate was in my bedroom with me and we heard a loud smacking noise, and we were concerned… The very next day when we talked to [Sarah] she was very upset, and… had said he had hit her in a very violent way.”      Katie Duffy, a former GW student and another of Sarah’s ex-housemates, said she had not realized that the “T.J.” from that night was the famed actor and comedian until informed by The Daily Beast. (She conceded she “had to Google him.”) But she recalled the incident much as Sarah had described it.      “One night, she had [Miller] back, and late at night… [a housemate and I] heard quite a lot of fighting [sounds] and banging, and loud, violent sounds [in the room next to us],” Duffy said. “So we knocked on the door of our housemate [Sarah], and asked if she was OK. She did indicate she was OK. Whatever response she gave, we felt we didn’t have to intervene further, at least at the time… Looking back, I wish we had done more to intervene, but we didn’t know what was going on… This is a girl I didn’t know very well, but it didn’t mean I didn’t have the power to go into that room, and remove her from that situation, and protect her. We did what we thought was the right thing at the time. It wasn’t enough.”      The next morning, Duffy recalled, Sarah came down to the small kitchen where other housemates were having coffee and breakfast. Her physical appearance raised alarm.      “She looked like she had been through a rough night—I recall seeing bruises [on Sarah],” Duffy said. “One roommate asked if she wanted to go to the police. Others offered to take her to the hospital, given how she looked.”      Sarah ultimately declined. Duffy moved out shortly thereafter, and said she hasn’t spoken to Sarah since, simply because “we didn’t know each other well.”      In the days and weeks that directly followed the alleged sexual assaults, Sarah’s friendship with Miller disintegrated completely. She said they met once more, days after that second night, to talk about what had happened; “T.J. said it was a ‘trust thing’… and that he thought I was into it,” Sarah recalled.      As they drifted apart, she asked mutual friends of Miller’s about the incident. According to Sarah and those close to her, the responses were fairly uniform, to the effect of, “Yeah, that’s just T.J.” The only other time she would see him over the next year was at a female comedy group show that she attended. “T.J. showed up to heckle, and I remember being so angry,” she said, “and had to leave.”      “ She looked like she had been through a rough night—I recall seeing bruises... One roommate asked if she wanted to go to the police. Others offered to take her to the hospital. ”      It would be almost a year—following much deliberations, counsel, and support from friends—before Sarah went to GW’s campus police to tell them what had happened. By then, Miller was in his last year at the university.      “I was not ready to process what was happening [the prior year], and I have spent a lot of time in my life apologizing for not having shouted ‘no,’ and for not having told my roommates to get him out of here,” Sarah said, explaining why she didn’t go to campus police a year earlier. “I was not ready to reconcile the events taking place with the person I had known. It was so disorienting and so physically traumatic.”      Like other female college students in similar circumstances, Sarah did not want to take the case to the cops since nearly a year had passed, and there was no remaining physical evidence. Instead, her allegations were handled by the “student court” at the university.      At this point, Sarah asked her housemate—the current Maryland mom who heard the “loud smacking noise”—if she would testify in the student court process, and she agreed.      “I testified in student court about the noise I had heard and how upset she was after the incident,” Sarah’s former housemate recalled to The Daily Beast. “T.J. was there with a lawyer during the student court proceeding.”      That housemate subsequently asked Duffy if she’d testified. “I was happy to,” Duffy said, recalling that she did not see Sarah at the student court during her testimony, but said that Miller, his father, and his attorney were there.      “I was asked why I hadn’t done anything [more] if I was so worried… and I said, well, the noises were loud enough that it did prompt us to ask what was wrong, so we did do something,” Duffy said. “I felt very uncomfortable, the way they were challenging me on it.”      Sarah said that the student court grilled her about “all my habits,” including what she had to drink, and how much, on both nights. She was asked if she had ever heard of erotic asphyxiation, and was asked if they had ever discussed the sexual practice, which she had not.      After a trial period that lasted a couple of weeks, Sarah said that the university told her that the issue had been resolved.      A GW spokesperson would only tell The Daily Beast that “because of federal privacy law, we are not able to provide information about current or former students’ education records,” in response to inquiries regarding a campus PD report or the student court proceedings. The federal law GW is referencing is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).      GW did confirm, however, that Miller graduated in 2003, but did not comment on whether he “graduated early” due to any unique circumstance. Other knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast that Miller was “expelled after he graduated”—an outcome that appeared to be an attempt by the university to satisfy both parties.      Sarah said she had lost acquaintances over her allegations, several of whom were her former comedy-troupe cohorts, most of whom ended up supporting Miller.      Four of these friends spoke to The Daily Beast, though none agreed to do so on the record. Each of these friends was in the college comedy troupe or matriculating at GW at the time. And all of them presented the same general portrait of Miller as a gregarious and generous person who “couldn’t have done this,” as several said.      “I’ve known T.J. since college, always known him to be a very caring person, and respectful, particularly toward women,” one friend said. “And he loves his wife very, very much.”      Another source, who testified in student court (via phone, post-graduation) on Miller’s behalf, said it was unimaginable that T.J. could do “anything like that.”      “I have never heard of another woman [who dated him in college] make any kind of allegation or insinuation that he was anything but a good guy,” the friend continued. Another friend insisted that Miller “was the type of person if you took him to a strip club, he would want to talk to the strippers, not hit on them.”      No one has accused Miller of hitting on strippers.      A source also produced a set of email exchanges between Miller and someone who dated Sarah later in life. The emails, one of which was presented without the conversation that preceded it, didn’t directly address the incident itself but instead showed both parties trying to come to a more amicable understanding. Sarah told The Daily Beast that she was simply under “some social pressure to be cool about this at the time, and didn't necessarily see myself as having any other option to resolution.”      One of Miller’s friends said he “believed [Sarah] knew she was making this up” to “intentionally and maliciously fabricate” a sexual-assault allegation. This friend could not offer any evidence to support such a claim, nor could another person, who wasn’t a friend of Miller’s but shared a similar view and testified on his behalf.      Kate and T.J. Miller made similar accusations in a statement‍ provided weeks after first learning that The Daily Beast was reporting on these incidents.      “We met this woman over a decade ago while studying together in college, she attempted to break us up back then by plotting for over a year before making contradictory claims and accusations,” the Millers wrote.      “She was asked to leave our university comedy group because of worrisome and disturbing behavior, which angered her immensely, she then became fixated on our relationship, and began telling people around campus ‘I’m going to destroy them’ and ‘I’m going to ruin him,’” the statement continued.      When asked about these claims, Sarah’s responded, “Of course not.”      “He was a friend to me before [the incidents], and he had been there for me before that,” she said. “I didn’t want him in jail. I didn’t hate him. He was someone I cared about… I don’t want to mess up his life. But he behaved in a way towards me that I have to live with… [and] I don’t think it’s appropriate that I carry this by myself.”      If Sarah was eager to settle scores with Miller, she certainly didn’t show it. When The Daily Beast first started looking into this story, those close to her said for months that she had expressed no desire to come forward and was actively avoiding media inquiries. Only weeks after the advent of the #MeToo movement did that seem to change.      Miller soon left his alma mater and became a star in stand-up comedy. He then began appearing in major Hollywood productions, and landed a starring role on the critically lauded HBO show Silicon Valley. But despite the lack of public accusations since his time at George Washington, whispers about what happened in his college years followed him.      Four female comedians and bookers who spoke to The Daily Beast said that they had heard of the alleged sexual misconduct at GW. Some of these comics had heard about the accusations from Sarah directly, and have since warned women in stand-up comedy about Miller.      But some know about the sexual-assault allegations because Miller talked about them himself when confiding in friends and associates.      Four sources in the L.A. and Chicago comedy scenes—including JC Coccoli, a Los Angeles-based producer who briefly dated Miller in 2009—said they each first heard of the allegations because Miller had told them about them or referenced them in private conversation, or at small gatherings before or after shows. Miller did so in the context of vehemently denying “rumors” circulating in various comedy communities. Other times, he would crack jokes about punching a woman he knew in college, two other comics independently told The Daily Beast.      Maura Brown, a comedy festival organizer and publicist who used to work in L.A. and has since uprooted to Portland, Oregon, said she has also heard about the Miller allegation for years.      “Very commonly, women have warned each other [in entertainment] about him… and about what happened in college,” Brown told The Daily Beast.      Brown noted that starting in 2013, when she first heard about the allegations, she “never wanted to work with him [ever], and never wanted to work on the same projects as him,” and that “this convinced me to not try to book him or promote him in any way.”      “ I didn’t want him in jail. I didn’t hate him. But he behaved in a way towards me that I have to live with… I don’t think it’s appropriate that I carry this by myself. ”      Still, Miller, whose star is increasingly rising in Hollywood these days, continues to have friends in high places in the entertainment world.      Miller is set to appear in several major film projects, including an upcoming movie co-starring Kristen Stewart and another starring Ryan Reynolds. This year, HBO aired his stand-up special, and Comedy Central started airing The Gorburger Show, what Miller has previously told The Daily Beast is his “passion project” about a murderous alien talk-show host.      Sarah, his alleged victim, no longer lives in L.A., where she resettled not long after auditing at GW. She says she had a “wonderful experience doing improv and comedy” in the local comedy scene, and tried to put what happened with Miller behind her.      “ I had to see him at my improv school [in L.A.], which I, shortly after, stopped going to, and see him at stand-up shows, and I stopped doing stand-up [eventually in L.A.],” Sarah said. “It doesn’t help that when I was living in L.A. I had to keep seeing his name on billboards, and on bus stops, and it just didn’t… stop.”      She added, “It is unfathomable to me that he doesn’t understand that he actually put me through something I have to live with, that I never would’ve chosen, that completely, completely set the tone for my sexual adult life, that I actively had to spend years and years… un-programming.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Comedy Central has cancelled T.J.

They're not exciting at all. There are 2 shocking scenes. They're all related to killing with axes. One of them is exceptionally appalling because it involves a child. Besides that, I felt detached while watching this film. I did not care about the characters. The 2 main characters, the sheriff and his estranged wife rarely spoke with each other. The last scene where the sheriff sat with his wife looking at sunrise was supposed to be touching. However, I felt nothing.It's worth watching for curiosity. A:","output":"Based on the given review, it can be concluded that the customer was dissatisfied with the product, which in this case is a movie. The dissatisfaction can be inferred from the various negative aspects pointed out in the review. Here's a breakdown of the criticisms mentioned by the customer: 1. Lack of suspense: The customer states that the movie lacks suspense, which suggests that they found it predictable and unengaging. This is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction, as suspense is a crucial element for creating an immersive experience in a movie. 2. Poorly executed fighting scenes: The customer mentions that the fighting scenes are quick and badly filmed, which indicates that they were not pleased with the way the action sequences were executed. This further implies dissatisfaction, as well-handled action scenes often contribute to the overall enjoyment of a movie. 3. Unexciting content: The reviewer points out that the movie's shocking scenes were limited and not particularly exciting, which suggests that it failed to provide the type of intense, thrilling experience they might have been looking for. 4. Lack of emotional connection: The customer explicitly states feeling detached while watching the movie and not caring about the characters. This shows that the movie did not successfully engage with their emotions, adding to their dissatisfaction. 5. Weak character development: The reviewer criticizes the relationship between the two main characters, the sheriff and his estranged wife, for not being well-developed and properly explored. This further highlights their dissatisfaction with the movie's storytelling and character development. 6. No emotional impact: The customer refers to a specific scene meant to be touching but mentions feeling nothing. This indicates that the movie failed to evoke any emotional reaction from them, which is a significant element of dissatisfaction, as emotional engagement is a key component of a satisfying movie experience. Despite these negative points, the customer mentions that the movie is worth watching for curiosity. This is a slight positive aspect to the review, but it's not enough to outweigh the numerous criticisms. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that the customer was predominantly dissatisfied with the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Diorama is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released on 31 March 2002 by Atlantic/Eleven. It won the 2002 ARIA Music Award for Best Group and Best Rock Album. The album was co-produced by Daniel Johns and David Bottrill. While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands, Diorama marked the first production credit for lead singer Johns. Johns wrote most of the album at the piano instead of his usual guitar, while the band took a 12-month break following their previous studio album, Neon Ballroom. Silverchair worked with composer Van Dyke Parks on Diorama; the album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads, a change from the post-grunge music typical of their earlier work, but consistent with the band's previous orchestrations on Neon Ballroom. The album's title refers to \\"a world within a world\\". Five singles were released: \\"The Greatest View\\", \\"Without You\\", \\"Luv Your Life\\", \\"Across the Night\\" and \\"After All These Years\\". All except \\"After All These Years\\", a promotional single, appeared on the Australian singles chart. Diorama was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band's earlier albums. It reached number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart and received a rating of 71 (out of 100) on review aggregator Metacritic. It was certified triple-platinum by ARIA, selling in excess of 210,000 copies, and won five ARIA Awards in 2002. Diorama was nominated for Highest Selling Album in 2003, and three songs from the album were nominated for awards over the two years.

She hoped that by engaging in this simple yet thoughtful gesture, both of them could ease into a more relaxed conversation and genuinely enjoy each other's company. Leslie wanted to ensure that Joel felt comfortable and less stressed during the visit, as she understood how overwhelming such situations could be for him. The act of offering tea not only displayed Leslie's genuine care for Joel but also highlighted her empathetic nature. She believed in the importance of nurturing the emotional well-being of others. And as the warm, fragrant tea filled the room with a sense of tranquility, it allowed the two of them to connect on a deeper level, putting aside any apprehensions and preconceived notions. As they sipped on their tea, the tension began to dissipate gradually. Joel initially took small, hesitant sips, while Leslie maintained a quiet, reassuring presence. Slowly, they started talking about various topics, from trivial everyday matters to more profound discussions about their dreams and aspirations. With each exchange, the atmosphere became lighter, and the anxiety that once gripped Joel's heart like a vice seemed to vanish into thin air. Over time, their conversations led to a mutual understanding and appreciation for one another. Although the anxiety never entirely left Joel, he experienced a substantial reduction due to Leslie's unconditional support and patience.

Next question: when did the minimum drinking age become 21?","output":"The history of the minimum drinking age in the United States has evolved over decades, influenced by social, political, and health-related factors. The establishment of a uniform minimum drinking age at 21 specifically can be traced back to the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. However, it is essential to look at the events leading up to this Act to understand the context and the reasons behind the age change. After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, most states set the legal drinking age at 21. This initial choice was driven by a mix of tradition and the fact that 21 years was considered the age of majority at the time. Over the years, however, many states lowered their drinking ages in response to changing public opinion and pressures from the youth vote. By the 1960s and early 1970s, as the Vietnam War raged on and the legal voting age was lowered to 18, activists argued that if young individuals were old enough to fight and vote, they should also be allowed to drink alcohol. By the late 1970s, 29 states had lowered their minimum drinking ages to 18, 19, or 20. However, this change led to a surge in alcohol-related traffic fatalities involving young drivers, prompting calls for a higher national minimum drinking age. In response, several states voluntarily increased their drinking ages, while others maintained the lower limits. In the early 1980s, public health advocates and organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) began intensively lobbying for a higher drinking age. Their lobbying efforts culminated with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act on July 17, 1984. Signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, this legislation required states to raise their minimum drinking age to 21 by October 1, 1986, or risk losing a portion of their federal highway funding. While the Act did not explicitly dictate a specific minimum drinking age, the attached financial penalties effectively set a national standard of 21 years. Faced with the potential loss of federal funding, all states eventually complied, with South Dakota, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico being the last to raise their drinking ages to 21 in September 1988. The increase in the national minimum drinking age to 21 has been credited with a significant decrease in alcohol-related traffic fatalities, particularly among young drivers. In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the higher legal drinking age has saved over 31,000 lives since 1984. However, the issue remains a subject of debate, with some calling for a reevaluation of the age limit and its effects on public health and individual rights."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a context, a sentence,  and a character.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this? A:","output":"Before Aubrey takes Taylor's shopping advice, Aubrey needs to first identify their financial goals and determine how much they want to save. Here is a step-by-step process for Aubrey: 1. Define financial goals: Aubrey should think about their short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial objectives, such as saving for a vacation, building an emergency fund, or planning for retirement. 2. Determine the target amount to save: Based on the financial goals, Aubrey should decide on a specific amount they want to save. This could be a percentage of their income or a fixed dollar amount. 3. Analyze current spending: Aubrey should track their expenses for a month to understand where their money is going. This will help them identify areas where they can cut back or save more. 4. Create a budget: Using the information from steps 2 and 3, Aubrey can create a monthly budget that includes categories for different types of expenses, such as rent, groceries, utilities, and discretionary spending. 5. Implement Taylor's shopping advice: Now that Aubrey has a budget in place, they can start following Taylor's advice to save money while shopping:   - Buy whatever they want: This option should also be carefully considered, as it's important to treat themselves occasionally but not overspend. Aubrey should allocate a specific amount for discretionary spending in their budget.      - Look for items that are on sale: Aubrey can save money by purchasing items on sale or using coupons. This can help reduce the overall cost of their purchases and help stay within the budget.      - Make a budget plan: Aubrey has already created a budget in step 4. Now they should stick to the plan and control their spending to effectively save money. 6. Review and adjust the plan: Aubrey should regularly review their budget to ensure they're on track with their savings goals. If needed, they can make adjustments to the budget or find additional ways to save. By following these steps, Aubrey can successfully save money and achieve their financial goals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has suggested holding an informal summit in the capital, Bratislava, in September, to give leaders of the remaining EU countries a chance to consider the future of the union. A \\"post-Brexit crisis summit\\", the news website euraktiv.sk calls it, saying that its theme will be \\"Whither the EU?\\" and will aim to articulate \\"a new vision\\" for the bloc as it prepares for the UK's departure. It recalls that Mr Fico told the European Council meeting in Brussels earlier this week that anyone who believes that after Brexit \\"we can just offer the European public more of the same is making a big mistake\\". According to Euraktiv.sk, if the summit takes place, it will be the first EU summit to be held outside Brussels since 2010 and the tone could be set by Central and Eastern European countries that joined the bloc in 2004. Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak has already taken part in post-Brexit talks with his counterparts from the Visegrad 4 group (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) which were held in the Czech capital, Prague, on Monday. The meeting was also attended by the French and German foreign ministers. The day after the Prague meeting, Mr Lajcak visited London for talks with his British opposite number Philip Hammond. Slovak daily Pravda points out that Mr Lajcak was the first EU minister to visit London after the Brexit vote. According to the paper, Mr Lajcak believes that Slovakia's experience in handling a \\"divorce\\" - it became an independent state in 1993 after having been part of Czechoslovakia - might now stand it in good stead. However, Slovak media are in no doubt about the scale of the task facing the country. \\"The presidency is beginning to haunt Fico,\\" news website aktualne.sk declares. The Slovak presidency will be \\"all about Brexit,\\" Michaela Terenzani predicts in the English-language Slovak Spectator. And the junior partner in Slovakia's coalition government, the mixed Slovak-Hungarian Most-Hid (Bridge) party, posted a statement on its Facebook page saying that \\"Britain's decision completely changes the Slovak presidency, it becomes the number one issueâ€¦ It is extremely important that Slovakia rises to the challenge of this presidency, for never before has a presiding country faced such a tough task\\".

Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked... Question: How does the writer feel about attending lectures? Answer: Possible answers: (1).

Here is a goal: To form the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of forming the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather the necessary ingredients and materials:    - Beeswax pellets or beeswax block    - Shea butter    - A double boiler or a makeshift version using a heat-safe glass bowl and a saucepan    - Heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon    - Essential oil(s) for scent or flavor (optional)    - Lip balm containers (plastic tubes, tins, or pots)    - Small funnel or pipette (optional, but helpful for precise pouring)    - Clean towel or paper towel for cleanup 2. Prepare the double boiler:    - Fill the bottom part of the double boiler (or the saucepan in the makeshift version) with 1 to 2 inches of water.    - Place the top part of the double boiler (or the heat-safe glass bowl) on top, making sure that the water doesn't touch the bottom of the top part.    - Have the heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon nearby for stirring. 3. Weigh and melt the beeswax and shea butter:    - Weigh the beeswax and shea butter using a kitchen scale. A typical lip balm recipe calls for a 1:1 ratio of beeswax and shea butter (e.g., 2 ounces of each). This may vary depending on your desired texture and consistency.    - Place the beeswax and shea butter in the top part of the double boiler.    - Turn the stove to low heat to slowly melt the beeswax and shea butter. Stir occasionally with the heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon to ensure even melting and to prevent scorching.    - Once the mixture is completely melted, remove the double boiler from the heat to avoid overheating the mixture. 4. Add essential oils (optional):    - If you'd like to add essential oils for scent or flavor, do so at this stage. Make sure to use lip-safe essential oils and follow the recommended dilutions. 5-10 drops of essential oil per 1 ounce of lip balm mixture is usually a good guideline.    - Stir the mixture thoroughly to disperse the essential oils evenly. 5. Pour the mixture into the lip balm containers:    - Place the lip balm containers on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table, with the lids removed. Make sure they are completely dry and clean.    - Using a steady hand or the small funnel or pipette, carefully pour the melted lip balm mixture into each container. Work reasonably quickly, as the mixture will start to solidify as it cools.    - Fill each container almost to the top, leaving a little space for the lip balm to contract as it cools and hardens. 6. Allow the lip balm mixture to set:    - After pouring the mixture into the containers, allow it to cool and harden at room temperature. This may take a couple of hours, depending on the size of the containers and the room temperature.    - To speed up the setting process, you can place the filled containers in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.    - Avoid touching the mixture while it hardens to prevent leaving dents or finger marks. 7. Seal and store the lip balm:    - Once the lip balm has hardened, place the lids on the containers and secure them tightly.    - Store the lip balm in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or heat sources. 8. Clean up:    - Wipe any spilled mixture from surfaces with a clean towel or paper towels before it hardens.    - Wash the double boiler, spatula or wooden spoon, and any other tools used with warm, soapy water. If there is any residue, it may help to heat the tools slightly to loosen the wax before washing. By following these steps diligently, you will have successfully formed the melted beeswax and shea butter mixture into a usable shape as a lip balm. You can now enjoy your homemade lip balm or even gift it to friends and family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in.

Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's.

If \\"A skateboarder jumps over a white fire hydrant.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The hydrant is under the skateboard.\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"The hydrant is under the skateboard\\" when the statement \\"A skateboarder jumps over a white fire hydrant\\" is given. To further elaborate on this reasoning, let's break down the scenario provided in the statement and analyze it step by step. 1. First of all, there is a skateboarder who is assumed to be standing or moving on a skateboard. 2. Secondly, there is a white fire hydrant mentioned in the scenario, which should be stationary as per its usual function. 3. The statement mentions that the skateboarder \\"jumps over\\" the white fire hydrant. The term \\"jumps over\\" implies that the skateboarder, along with the skateboard, must become airborne over the fire hydrant for a brief moment. To achieve this action, the skateboarder has to exert sufficient force in the upward direction to lift the skateboard and their body off the ground, thereby creating an air gap between the skateboard and the fire hydrant. As a result, the skateboarder and the skateboard would clear the fire hydrant, enabling them to land back on the ground after passing over the white fire hydrant. Assuming that this jump progresses successfully, we can analyze the relative position of the skateboard and the fire hydrant during this scenario. When the skateboarder is mid-air in the process of clearing the fire hydrant, the board would be at a higher vertical position than the fire hydrant. Given that the fire hydrant's position remains unchanged, the skateboard would essentially be above it. Since the skateboard is above the fire hydrant, we can reverse the perspective to deduce that the fire hydrant is indeed under the skateboard in that specific moment of the jump. Therefore, the statement \\"The hydrant is under the skateboard\\" logically follows the scenario where \\"A skateboarder jumps over a white fire hydrant.\\" However, it is important to note that this statement only holds true for the duration of the jump when the skateboarder is airborne and clearing the hydrant. Once the skateboarder is no longer above the fire hydrant, the statement would cease to be applicable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information:  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow.  - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\".  - Petrochelidon is a genus of birds known as cliff - nesting swallows . The genus includes all of the five species of birds commonly called cliff swallow , and contains the following species :  - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.    'petrochelidon' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'?  Choices: - animal  - bird  - hirundinidae  - hirundo  - homo  - mammal  - ostrich  - passeriformes  - plant  - rustica The answer is:","output":"hirundinidae Step-by-step justification: 1. The question asks about the 'parent taxon' of 'petrochelidon'. 2. 'Petrochelidon' is a genus of birds known as cliff-nesting swallows. 3. The information provided states that swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae.

Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing 10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry, who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet.

Here is a news article: Not so when it comes to women voters, as everyone is by now well aware. Indeed, according to a Washington Post–ABC News poll, the gender gap between Obama and Romney currently yawns at a chasmic 19 points. To no small extent, Romney is suffering from wounds inflicted by the GOP nomination fight, in which Santorum’s ultracon positions on social and cultural issues forced the former Massachusetts governor further right than he wants or needs to be. (As for where he actually is—hey, who knows? We’re talking about Mitt Romney here!) And for weeks, Democrats, led by party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, made hay of the spectacle, crowing loudly and gleefully about the Republican war on women.      It was this phenomenon that Romney attempted to turn on its head by maintaining that Obama’s economic policies were the real source of violence against the ladies. There were two mountainous problems with the ploy, however. First, it featured as its basis an entirely implausible (and quickly debunked) statistic: that women have accounted for 92 percent of job losses since the president took occupancy of the White House. And second, it was followed up by a campaign conference call—specifically on women’s issues, n.b.—in which Romney’s advisers couldn’t answer a basic query about whether the presumptive Republican nominee supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which made it easier for women to sue for equal pay and was the first piece of legislation Obama signed into law.      But then some manna fell from the heavens and straight into Team Romney’s lap in the form of the Rosen flap. Put aside the fact that Rosen doesn’t work for Obama or for the Democratic Party. Put aside that much of what she said on CNN would have gone without notice had it not been for one horrific line: “Guess what? [Romney’s] wife has never worked a day in her life.” That one line was enough to ignite a classic media freak-show conflagration, allowing Team Romney to seize the moral and political high ground and, most important, spring out of its defensive crouch and launch a fierce offensive.      Was the resulting 24-hour squall anything but absurd? Certainly not. But Democrats airily pooh-poohing the matter needed only to look at the reaction of the Obama campaign, the White House, and the DNC to get an accurate read on whether the Democratic forces sensed that they were suddenly vulnerable. Both Jim Messina and David Axelrod, two of Obama’s top political hands, insta-­tweeted strongly worded disavowals of Rosen’s remarks. Michelle Obama tweeted a message of implicit support for Ann Romney, and Obama himself followed up more explicitly in an TV interview that day. And by the following morning, DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse was running as fast as he could from not only Rosen but the war-on-women appellation itself: “I’m not a fan of the term,” Woodhouse told Slate’s Dave Weigel. “We in the DNC have not been running a campaign based on the term ‘war on women.’ ” To which all one can say is: Ahem.      It would be easy enough to dismiss all this as irrelevant. Yet the antic, manic, overwrought first week of the general election did convey clearly two lessons worth pondering. The first is that, on both taxes and the gender gap, the Romney campaign isn’t going down without a fight—and it would behoove the Obamans to beware the ample dangers of smugness and sloppiness and overplaying their (admittedly strong) hand. And the second is that the campaign henceforward will be anything but pretty. How personal things will get remains to be seen. But neither side has ever demonstrated any reluctance not just to wage war but to scorch the earth in the process. In other words, if you thought the GOP nomination tussle was sickeningly, deplorably, appallingly brutish, superficial, and mean, I have five words of advice: Avert your eyes now, people. |||||             Barack Obama has been accused of many sins, but among the most common Republican charges against him is that he is a warmonger—though not in the usual sense of the term, of course. Just since the turn of the New Year, conservatives have inveighed against Obama for prosecuting a “war on oil,” a “war on coal” (with an attendant “war on Appalachia”), and a “war on energy”; a “war on religion,” a “war on the Vatican,” and a “war on the Catholic Church”; a “war on the Supreme Court” and a “war on the U.S. Constitution”; and, according to a new book co-authored by anti-tax zealot Grover Norquist, a “war on jobs and growth.”      Even against this background of promiscuous martial-metaphorizing, however, few would have predicted that Mitt Romney would spend his first full day as a general-election candidate assailing Obama for waging—wait for it—a war on women. Or that the next day, after the kerfuffle involving Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen erupted, Romney’s people would attack Obama for inciting a “war on moms.” And for engaging in “class warfare” with the Buffett Rule. And for stoking a “war on reality” for … who knows? But while Democrats may tut-tut and shake their heads, they are hardly innocent here. It was the left, after all, that introduced the war-on-women lingo to the political vernacular in the first place.      Phony wars are nothing new in presidential politics, to be sure, but rarely have they been this dimwitted, dishonest, debasing, or, when it comes to what the months between now and November hold in store, so utterly depressing. And yet as dismaying as last week was, it was also revealing of the terrain and tactics that will define the general election—with Chicago relentlessly touting economic fairness and seeking to exacerbate Romney’s weaknesses with key constituencies such as women, and with Boston talking economic opportunity and scrambling to rehab its man’s battered image with those same groups. The Democratic side is the favorite in this fight, no doubt. But there are signs amid the skirmishing that the Republican team can’t be counted out just yet.      Let’s start with the scrap over the Buffett Rule, and tax policy more broadly. On the former, Obama has proposed (in a bill that the Senate will take up this week but is almost certain not to pass) that incomes over 1 million be taxed at an effective rate of 30 percent. On the latter, he pledges to allow the Bush tax cuts for families making more than 250,000 to expire at the end of the year. These are the plans that Romney and his allies characterize as class warfare—plans motivated by “the president’s priority of income redistribution,” as Karl Rove put it, and “designed to be punitive” to the successful, as top Romney surrogate John Sununu chimed in.      On the merits, of course, the claims are ludicrous to the point of being laughable. It’s often (and rightly) pointed out that, with respect to the Bush tax cuts, what the Obamans want is a return to the Clinton-era tax rates—but only for the top 2 percent of filers. The Buffett Rule would affect even fewer people: the 0.08 percent of taxpayers, according to calculations by Citizens for Tax Justice, who earn most of their income through capital gains. And, though raising the tax rate on those gains to 30 percent would be a doubling of the rate that currently obtains, it would still be 5 percent lower than it was after the 1986 tax reform ushered in by (and venerated by conservative fans of) the sainted Ronald Reagan. Who knew the Gipper was a class warrior too?      In truth, Obama’s tax plans are designed to be punitive only in one sense and toward one person: politically for Romney, whose refusal to release more than one year of his tax returns (despite having handed over 23 years’ worth to John ­McCain as part of his V.P. vetting in 2008) has become a prime target for Chicago. Why? Because the Obamans suspect that Romney’s returns would show that over many years he has engaged in an aggressive strategy of tax avoidance—perhaps perfectly legal but still illustrating his out-of-touchness. As Joe Biden asked a New Hampshire audience at a speech last week, “How many of you all have a Swiss bank account?”      But the politics of Obama’s tax platform and his wider argument in favor of economic fairness aren’t clearly in his favor. According to a recent poll released by centrist Democratic group Third Way, 42 percent of independents and 43 percent identified as “swing independents” (those who remain undecided) agree with the statement, “We need an economy based on fairness, where the rich pay their fair share, corporations play by the rules, and all Americans get a fair shot.” By contrast, 47 and 51 percent of those groups agree with the assertion, “We need an economy based on opportunity, where hard work is rewarded, the government lives within its means, and economic growth is our top priority.” And by wide majorities, both groups say that fixing the budget deficit is more important than reducing income inequality. All of which reaffirms the one soft spot for Obama in other national polls: For all Romney’s troubles, he is running roughly even with the incumbent on the issues of jobs, the economy, and putting the nation’s fiscal house in order. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article discusses the tactics and terrain that will define the general election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.

Write an article based on this summary: A man has been jailed for raping a teenage girl almost daily for four years, the attempted rape another girl and abuse of a third.","output":"Title: Four-Year Nightmare: Man Jailed for Continuous Rape and Abuse of Three Teenage Girls Introduction A shocking case unfolded in the courtroom as a man faced the consequences of his unimaginable actions - raping a teenage girl almost daily for four years, attempting to rape another girl, and the abuse of a third. As the details of these heinous crimes were exposed, it was evident that justice needed to be served to protect the victims and society as a whole. The Crimes The despicable actions committed by the offender went on for an appalling four years. During this time, he raped a teenage girl nearly every day, subjecting her to a life of torment and fear. Due to the sensitive nature of the case, her identity remains anonymous to protect her privacy, offering her some solace. The extended duration of this monstrous act highlights the dreadful control the perpetrator had over the victim, robbing her of her freedom, security, and innocence. Moreover, the man attempted to rape another teenage girl, while also subjecting a third to an unspecified form of abuse. Both teenagers have had their identities protected to preserve their dignity. All three victims have come forward to expose their attacker, displaying admirable courage as they seek justice for the atrocities perpetrated against them. The Investigation and Trial After the assaults were reported, an extensive investigation was launched. The police interviewed the victims, collected evidence, and built a solid case against the man. The gathered evidence was presented during the trial, and witnesses testified to the harrowing crimes committed by the accused. Throughout the trial, the prosecution pressed for the harshest possible punishment, citing the inexcusable nature of these offenses and the devastating impact on the victims' lives. Conversely, the defense employed various strategies to either justify the actions or lessen the gravity of the crimes, which ultimately proved futile. Sentencing and Repercussions Following a comprehensive trial, the man was ultimately found guilty of the atrocious acts and sentenced to an extended term in jail, ensuring the safety of the innocent from such a dangerous individual. This verdict serves as a significant victory for the victims, restoring hope that justice prevails even in the face of adversity. Aside from the jail sentence, the man is now officially registered as a sex offender. This designation will follow him for the rest of his life and restricts his access to certain institutions, ensuring accountability for his actions, even after serving his time. Conclusion The harrowing experiences endured by the three victims are a stark reminder of the importance of bringing abusers to justice. Society must continue to support survivors, encouraging them to share their stories and seek retribution. Moreover, the legal system must continually strive to protect the vulnerable, taking a firm stance against such heinous crimes. Though the physical and emotional wounds inflicted on these teenagers may never fully heal, the jailing of their abuser is an important step towards closure. Let this case serve as a deterrent to potential offenders, demonstrating that no matter the duration or extent of criminal actions, justice will always seek to triumph and protect the innocent."},{"instruction":"Q: Kai finally convinced his husband to get a new dog there.

In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs—Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen—from New York, purchased 6,642 acres (26.88 km2) of land along Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city. The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.

Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

Title: Ferdinand the Bull Movie plot: In the beginning, there are a lot of bulls, romping around together and butting their heads. There was only one bull who wasn't doing that, and that was Ferdinand. All he wanted to do was go under a shady cork tree and smell the flowers all day. Then one day his mother noticed that he wasn't playing with the other bulls. His mom asked him why he wasn't butting his head with the other bulls. He replied that all he wanted to do was to sit and smell the flowers. Luckily, his mother was very understanding. Over the years, Ferdinand grew and grew until he was as big as the tree. The other bulls wanted to accomplish one goal in life: to be in the bullfights in Madrid, Spain, but not Ferdinand. Then one day, five strange-looking men were here to see the bulls. When the bulls noticed them, they fought as rough as possible, hoping that they would get picked, but not Ferdinand who went back to smell the flowers. Just as Ferdinand was sitting, he accidentally sat on a bumblebee. That made him go crazy and on a rampage, knocking the other bulls out and crashed into a tree, making it fall down. The five men cheered as they took Ferdinand to Madrid. There was a lot of excitement when the day of the bullfight came. On posters, they called him Ferdinand the Fierce. At the ring came out banderilleros, picadors and the matador who was being cheered on. When he was bowing, a woman in the audience gave him a bouquet of flowers which landed in his hand. Then the moment came where Ferdinand came out. He was wondering what was he doing there. The banderilleros and picadors were scared and hid, but the matador was scared stiff because Ferdinand was so big and strong. But Ferdinand looked up in the stands and saw all of the beautiful hats that the women were wearing, each decorated with lovely, fragrant flowers. He couldn't stop staring at all the beautiful hats. The matador was very angry that Ferdinand wasn't charging at him. But Ferdinand was not interested in fighting; he was only interested in admiring the beautiful flowers....

Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &...  answer the following question:  In what year did the song Symfonin reach top of the Swedish singles charts at the festival that has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts?

Q: Article: A reader from Brazil recently wrote to us asking for some advice. He's planning a trip to the United States, and wanted to know about the best places to travel in America. Today, we are going to give you some information which may help you when choosing your destination. Each of the 50 states in America has interesting things to offer visitors, but some are more popular than others. Washington, D.C. is famous for its historical places, like the White House and the Lincoln Memorial. Visitors to Los Angeles, California can see the Hollywood Walk of Fame or shop the stores on Rodeo Drive where they may see a star or two. The Grand Canyon in Arizona appeals to hikers, climbers and nature lovers, as does Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. TripAdvisor is a website where people can write reviews about their travel experiences. Every year, TripAdvisor makes a list of the top 25 cities to visit in the United States. The results are based on the opinions of visitors to the website. Brooke Ferencsik of TripAdvisor said the top picks on the list were not surprising. And it's no secret why New York City was named the number one destination. New York City is sometimes called \\"the city that never sleeps\\" because it can be very busy. It is an exciting place for many people because there is so much to do. But the city might be too busy for travelers looking for rest and calm. They might want something more like Myrtle Beach, in the state of South Carolina, which made it to number 21 on Trip Advisor's list. \\"A lot of people come to Myrtle Beach for great weather, it's a wonderful family vacation spot, the beaches - got the wonderful Atlantic beaches there - there's a lot of family-friendly parks and water parks.\\" Many people take time off from their jobs in the summer to travel. Because there are many tourists visiting other places, June until August is known as \\"high season.\\" Traveling during the high season can be crowded. Hotels, restaurants, and transportation might also be very expensive. If you want to save money on a trip, it is a good idea to plan to leave before or after the summer months. These times are known as \\"shoulder seasons\\" for travel. \\"If you're looking for value, try and think about traveling through the shoulder season if it's possible - the shoulder season being the fall or the spring. The weather is still very good in some of these destinations, and you can get better prices.\\" America's major cities are still the most popular destinations for visitors. Ferencsik says this is because of the good quality of services they provide tourists. \\"They do a great job of giving travelers what they want when they're on vacation. I think they kind of cater to every type of traveler need. So whether you're traveling alone, you're traveling for business, you're traveling with your family - whatever it is, those destinations are really tuned in to delivering amazing experiences and just a lot of different opportunities when you're there.\\"   Question: Lily has great interest in nature and American history.

Frustrated by this decision and by the Dutch Republic's insistence on neutrality, Britain soon turned to Russia. On September 30, 1755, Britain pledged financial aid to Russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the Livonian-Lithunian border, so they could defend Britain's interests in Hanover immediately.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Under what dynasty did the regional military governors gain power? is inside the article: The Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating An Lushan Rebellion (755-763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry.  Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang.  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title Tängri Qaghan by the Tang Emperor Taizong in addition to his title as emperor was eastern Asia's first \\"simultaneous kingship\\".Many notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of woodblock printing.  Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence.  However, in the 840s the Emperor Wuzong of Tang enacted policies to persecute Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence. Although the dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless. However, agrarian rebellions in the latter half of the 9th century resulted in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou massacre of 878–879., can you guess it ?

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon.

Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's.

Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case.

Article: Drew Gilpin Faust made history in 2007 when she became the first female president of Harvard University, Massachusetts, US. Faust is an excellent historian known especially for her work on the history of the American South. She was a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania for 25 years. In 2001, she became dean   of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard.         Born in 1947, Faust grew up in a traditional family. She has often spoken of her \\"continued confrontations  \\" with her mother \\"about the requirements of what she usually called femininity  \\". Her mother used to tell her, \\"It's a man's world, sweetie. And the sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be.\\"          However, the daughter was a rebellious one. For example, Faust would fight with her mother over whether it was suitable for her to drive a car at night, even if one of her three brothers was a passenger. \\"She was raised to be a rich man's wife,\\" said a friend, Elizabeth Warren. \\"Instead she becomes the president of the most powerful university in the world.\\"         As a girl, Faust rebelled against not only the strict rules of femininity, but also the racial injustice that existed in her native Virginia. At age 9, after a conversation with her family's black handyman   and driver, she sent a letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower decrying   racial injustice. When studying in Bryn Mawr, a women's college in Pennsylvania, she was a student activist who would go on to march in the civil rights protests   in the 1960s.          What would her mother, who never went to college and died in 1966, have to say about her appointment? \\"I've often thought about that,\\" she said. \\"I've had dialogues with my dead mother over the 40 years since she died.\\" Question: Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: David \\"Davy\\" Crockett (August 17, 1786 - March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier, and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet \\"King of the Wild Frontier\\". He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the Texas Revolution. Crockett grew up in East Tennessee, where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling. On October 25, 1824, Crockett notified his constituents of his intention to run in the 1825 election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He lost that election to incumbent Adam Rankin Alexander. A chance meeting in 1826 gained him the encouragement of Memphis mayor Marcus Brutus Winchester to try again to win a seat in Congress. The Jackson Gazette published a letter from Crockett on September 15, 1826 announcing his intention of again challenging Rankin, and stating his opposition to the policies of President John Quincy Adams and Secretary of State Henry Clay and to Rankin's position on the cotton tariff. Militia veteran William Arnold also entered the race, and Crockett easily defeated both political opponents for the 1827-29 term. He arrived in Washington D.C. and took up residence at Mrs. Ball's Boarding House, where a number of other legislators lived when Congress was in session. Jackson was elected as President in 1828. Crockett continued his legislative focus on settlers getting a fair deal for land titles, offering H.R. 27 amendment to a bill sponsored by James K. Polk.  Crockett was re-elected for the 1829-31 session, once again defeating Adam Rankin Alexander. He introduced H.R. 185 amendment to the land bill on January 29, 1830, but it was defeated on May 3. On February 25, 1830, he introduced a resolution to abolish the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York because he felt that it was public money going to benefit the sons of wealthy men. He spoke out against Congress giving 100,000 to the widow of Stephen Decatur, citing that Congress was not empowered to do that. He opposed Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act and was the only member of the Tennessee delegation to vote against it. Cherokee chief John Ross sent him a letter on January 13, 1831 expressing his thanks for Crockett's vote. His vote was not popular with his own district, and he was defeated in the 1831 election by William Fitzgerald.  Crockett ran against Fitzgerald again in the 1833 election and was returned to Congress, serving until 1835. On January 2, 1834, he introduced the land title resolution H.R. 126, but it never made it as far as being debated on the House floor. He was defeated for re-election in the August 1835 election by Adam Huntsman. During his last term in Congress, he collaborated with Kentucky Congressman Thomas Chilton to write his autobiography, which was published by E. L. Carey and A. Hart in 1834 as A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself, and he went east to promote the book. In 1836, newspapers published the now-famous quotation attributed to Crockett upon his return to his home state:  I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas. Did he have any major accomplishments while in the house?","output":"While serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, Davy Crockett's primary focus was on advocating for the rights of settlers to obtain fair land titles. Although he did not have any landmark accomplishments, he frequently introduced amendments and resolutions related to this subject. For example, during his term from 1827 to 1829, he offered H.R. 27 amendment to a bill sponsored by James K. Polk, aiming to ensure fair deals for land titles. In the 1829-31 session, he introduced the H.R. 185 amendment to the land bill on January 29, 1830, but it was ultimately defeated on May 3. Crockett also showed commitment to the responsible use of public funds, introducing a resolution on February 25, 1830, to abolish the United States Military Academy at West Point, believing it was public money serving the wealthy. He was vocal against granting financial support to individuals, such as the 100,000 offered to Stephen Decatur's widow, which he felt was outside Congress's authority to do. Crockett further showcased his principle-driven nature by opposing Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act, being the only member from the Tennessee delegation to vote against it. This stand earned him gratitude from Cherokee Chief John Ross but also became unpopular within his constituency, contributing to his 1831 electoral defeat. Upon his return to Congress in 1833, Crockett introduced the land title resolution H.R. 126 on January 2, 1834, but it never progressed to a debate on the House floor. He lost re-election in August 1835, but during his last term, Crockett co-wrote his autobiography with Kentucky Congressman Thomas Chilton, called \\"A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett, Written by Himself.\\" The famous quote attributed to him in 1836 further reflects his dedication to his constituents: \\"I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas.\\" In summary, while Davy Crockett did not have any significant accomplishments during his time in the House of Representatives, his persistent efforts to secure fair land deals for settlers and consistent actions driven by his principles are worth noting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I love the holidays as much as the next guy (even if I often have a bad case of the holiday blues), but it seems it's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of Holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year, but that doesn't make them any less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and *gulp* still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at home with Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (save the occasionally crude humor and Santa's \\"Little\\" Helper wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol' Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there?  It's a shame really. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable Christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never-aging Santa (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good ol' brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on Father Christmas, and his THIS close to being shut down. Hah! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! SI don't know if I'd praise the casting or to bash it. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they're given way too little to work with. As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could possibly come up with is Santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf. I have to admit I had a few giggles involving Fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers (where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. Worse still, the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that's supposed to make us \\"feel good\\" and teach us a lesson about \\"what Christmas really means\\". Apparently, what Christmas means to Hollywood is getting as much of our leftover Christmas shopping money as they can. Rating: ** out of 5. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Available options: A. negative. B. positive.","output":"This review can be considered as A. negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the film, FRED CLAUS, stating that it has a tired formula and fails to offer enough humor. The cast, though talented, is said to have little material to work with, resulting in a disappointing holiday comedy. The sentimentality in the movie is also criticized and viewed as an attempt to teach a cliched lesson about the true meaning of Christmas. Overall, the reviewer doesn't seem to find much to appreciate in the film and gives it a rating of 2 out of 5 stars."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: In the 20th century, as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan had all been occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the capital of the Republic of China had been temporary relocated to Chongqing, then a major city in Sichuan. An enduring legacy of this move is that nearby inland provinces, such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou, which previously never had modern Western-style universities, began to be developed in this regard. The difficulty of accessing the region overland from the eastern part of China and the foggy climate hindering the accuracy of Japanese bombing of the Sichuan Basin, made the region the stronghold of Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang government during 1938-45, and led to the Bombing of Chongqing.

Two of Earth's oceans provide vast quantities of fish for human consumption. The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life.  Hint: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How did Calvin and his followers view politics?\\"  Context: \\"Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Calvin and his followers viewed politics as a combination of aristocracy and democracy, valuing the freedom to elect authorities and resist political absolutism.

Сомалийский национальный альянс Translate this to English?","output":"The phrase \\"Сомалийский национальный альянс\\" translates to English as \\"Somali National Alliance\\".  The Somali National Alliance (SNA) was a political organization in Somalia, which was formed in the late 20th century during the Somali civil war. The alliance was composed of several warlords and their respective clans, who sought collectively for dominance and stability in the war-torn nation.  The SNA played a significant role in the ongoing feud for control over the capital city, Mogadishu, through the 1980s and 90s. One of the prominent leaders of the SNA was General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a influential figure during the civil war period. He, along with other warlords, sought to remove the reigning UNOSOM II, which was the second United Nations humanitarian and peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Despite its influential status during its existence, the SNA was marked by internal conflicts and power struggles, largely due to the complex clan dynamics that define Somali politics. This ultimately led to the dissolution of the organization by the late 1990s as alliances shifted, clans defected, and new organizations emerged. The legacy of the Somali National Alliance is a significant chapter in Somali history, serving as a representation of the political and social turmoil that characterized the civil war era. Its story contributes to understanding the complex clan alliances and disputes that continue to influence Somali politics and society to this day. While the SNA no longer exists in its original form, its impact is still felt in the ongoing efforts to create a stable government and society in Somalia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientists are observing two of the same gases at different temperatures. They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all.  Which gas is at a lower temperature?  Hint: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.","output":"Based on the kinetic-molecular theory you mentioned, the gas with particles that are hardly moving at all would be Gas B.

Input: Question: Who was the founder of the party that Ohlendorf joined in 1925? Passage 1:Born in Hoheneggelsen (today part of Söhlde; then in the Kingdom of Prussia), Otto Ohlendorf came into the world as part of \\"a farming family\\". He joined the Nazi Party in 1925 (member 6631) and the SS (member #880) in 1926. Ohlendorf studied economics and law at the University of Leipzig and the University of Göttingen, and by 1930 was already giving lectures at several economic institutions. He studied at the University of Pavia, where he gained his doctor's degree in jurisprudence; and by 1933 he obtained the position of a research directorship in the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Ohlendorf was active in the National Socialist Students' League in both Kiel and Göttingen and taught at the Nazi Party's school in Berlin. He participated in major debates between the SS, the German Labour Front, and the Quadrenniel Organization on economic policy. By 1938 he was also manager in the Trade section of the Reich Business Board (). Historian quips that for Ohlendorf, Nazism was a \\"quest for race\\" in the historical continuum, and even though he never stated it that way, his faith in Germandom was akin to that of his fellow SS intellectuals.  Passage 2:In 1946, Anna Mae Hutchison posted a 26-14 record with 102 strikeouts in 51 games, setting an all-time, single-season record for games pitched, and also hurled the first nine-inning no-hitter in Belles history, a 1–0 victory over the Kenosha Comets. Winter finished with a 33-9 record, including 17 shutouts and 183 strikeouts in 46 pitching appearances. The Belles claimed first place with a league-best 74-38 record, and won the semifinal round of playoffs by defeating the South Bend Blue Sox in four games. In Game 1, English drove in the winning run by hitting a double in the bottom half of the 14th inning. Then, in decisive Game 5 she knocked the winning run with a single in the bottom half of the 17th inning. In this first round series she went 11-for-31 for a .353 average, including her two game-winning RBI. After that, the Belles beat the 1945 champions, the Rockford Peaches, four games to two in the final best-of-seven series to clinch the Championship Title. Throughout the playoffs, Kurys led all players in average, stolen bases and runs. On the other hand, Winter collected four wins in the playoffs, including a 14-inning, 1–0 shutout victory over the Peaches in decisive Game Six. The winning run was scored by Kurys on an RBI-single by Betty Trezza, while Danhauser handled 22 chances flawlessly. During the regular season, the Belles again showed a great defense, notably by infielders Danhauser (1B), Kurys (2B) and English (3B), while Perlick (LF), Schillace (CF) and Dapkus (RF) patrolled the outfield. And moreover, fielding ability and speed on the bases were immensely more crucial and challenging in a dominant pitching league.  Passage 3:CCGS Labrador was a icebreaker.

Her career marked the beginning of the CCG's icebreaker operations which continue to this day. She extensively charted and documented the then-poorly-known Canadian Arctic, and as HMCS Labrador was the first ship to circumnavigate North America in a single voyage.

Plot: Captain John Harris leads a group of ragtag soldiers who have been assigned a critical mission: they must travel deep into Confederate territory to forage for food or risk the slow death of their comrades from starvation. As the story unfolds, we meet a diverse group of men with unique backgrounds and skills. Among them are a skilled tracker, a master negotiator, and a Confederate defector who knows the terrain all too well. Together, they face numerous obstacles while traversing through enemy soil, including hostile locals, bounty hunters, and ambushes from Confederate soldiers. With each passing day, their solidarity grows stronger, and they fight not only to complete their mission but to stay alive as well. During one fateful encounter with a Southern farmer, the team discovers secrets about food distribution and supply chains in the Confederacy that could change the course of the war. Desperate Harvest takes on a more profound meaning when it's revealed that a handful of corrupt Confederate officers have been hoarding food supplies, starving their own people for profit. While the mission remains their priority, Captain Harris must decide whether to take the risk of unearthing this scandal or focus solely on completing the task at hand. As the climax approaches, the Union soldiers face a major obstacle when they are ambushed by Confederate forces. With their food supplies captured, they are surrounded and left with no obvious means of escape. Unwilling to let their people starve, Harris and his team devise a daring plan to free themselves from the enemy's grasp. They covertly dismantle the hoarded food supplies and redistribute them to not only their own battalion but also to the starving Southern population, with the hope that they will join the Union and rebel against their commanders. The movie ends dramatically with Harris and his men fleeing through the night, as now, both Confederate and bounty hunters are on their tails. As morning dawns, we see the communities they've helped and the food they have shared, creating a groundswell of support for the Union cause, showing the price of true heroism in desperate times. \\"The Desperate Harvest\\" is a gripping, heart-wrenching tale of survival, loyalty, and the human spirit that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end.

What is the best way to: To attach pages of a book together, you can Pick from: - Use a glue stick applied to each exposed area; - Use cooking oil applied to each exposed area; Answer:","output":"Using a glue stick applied to each exposed area is the best way to attach pages of a book together.  Here's a detailed explanation of why using a glue stick is a better option than using cooking oil: 1. Adhesion: A glue stick contains adhesives that are specifically designed to hold paper together. It sticks well to surfaces once applied and provides strong bonding. On the other hand, cooking oil doesn't have adhesive properties and, therefore, won't be effective in holding the pages together. The pages may separate easily, leading to the book falling apart. 2. Drying Time: A glue stick generally dries faster than cooking oil on paper. This allows you to work quickly and efficiently while attaching pages together. Using cooking oil would likely result in a longer drying time, leading to delays in the binding process, especially if you are attempting to work with multiple pages or books. 3. Long-term preservation: Using a glue stick on paper won't have any adverse effects on the integrity of the pages over time, as its formula is designed to be used on paper products. On the other hand, cooking oil could compromise the pages' quality as it can seep into the paper fibers, weaken them, and eventually cause the pages to break or become discolored due to oxidation. 4. No staining: Glue sticks are generally transparent or slightly opaque once dried, so they don't leave visible stains on the paper. Conversely, using cooking oil may leave oil stains on the pages, causing them to look messy and unattractive. 5. Ease of use: A glue stick is easy to apply and control during the binding process. It allows for precise application of adhesive without creating a mess. In contrast, applying cooking oil to paper can be tricky and messy, leading to a difficult, time-consuming, and potentially frustrating process. 6. Readily available and affordable: Glue sticks are widely available in different sizes and brands, and are relatively inexpensive. Additionally, they are specifically designed for binding paper together, making them the perfect choice for attaching pages of a book. On the other hand, cooking oil may be easily accessible in a kitchen, but it is not the ideal material for this purpose. Its cost may also vary depending on the type of oil and region, but investing in a glue stick meant for this task is a better overall choice. In summary, using a glue stick to attach pages of a book together is a superior option because it is specifically designed for paper adhesion, dries quickly, preserves the integrity of the pages, leaves no visible stains, is easy to use, and is an affordable and widely available choice. Using cooking oil is not ideal due to its lack of adhesive properties, the potential for staining and weakening the paper, and the challenges of applying it in a controlled manner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the following context:  As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him  bewailing their loss.  answer the following question:  What are the names of the three people who are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich? Answer:","output":"The names of the three people observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich are Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Flosshilde. These three individuals are the Rhinemaidens, who serve as guardians of the gold in the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 'Kill Jews' Town Finally Changes Name A Spanish village with a name that translates to “Camp Kill Jews” has finally officially changed its name to Castrillo Mota de Judios, or “Jews’ Hill Camp.” Residents of Castrillo Matajudios first voted to change the name last year, with 29 of the village’s 57 inhabitants voting in favor of the change. The name change has now been approved by the regional government of Castilla y Leon, the Associated Press reports. The town’s former name, which dates back to 1627, was especially puzzling due to the fact that the town was founded by Jews fleeing from pogroms in 1035. Today, the town has no Jewish residents, despite its official shield containing the Star of David. Spain has a checkered history of treatment towards Jewish residents, including a 1492 edict that ordered Jews to convert to Catholicism or leave the country. In early June, Spain’s lower house of parliament approved a law paving a pathway to citizenship for descendants of Jews who were forced to leave the country during the inquisition. According to the AP, researchers believe the village actually got its name from Jewish residents who wanted to bolster the believability of their conversion.

Summary:","output":"Once there was a village in Spain with a name that meant \\"Camp Kill Jews\\". The people living there didn't want that name anymore, so they voted to change it to \\"Jews' Hill Camp\\". Now, the local government has said it's okay to change the name. The old name was strange because long ago the village was started by Jewish people running away from danger.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Moss was born in London, son of Alfred Moss, a dentist of Bray, Berkshire, and Aileen (nee Craufurd). He was brought up at Long White Cloud house on the right bank of the River Thames. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who became a successful rally driver and married Erik Carlsson. During his driving career, Moss was one of the most recognised celebrities in Britain, leading to many media appearances. In March 1958, Moss was a guest challenger on the TV panel show What's My Line? (episode with Anita Ekberg). In 1959 he was the subject of the TV programme This Is Your Life. On June 12 the following year he was interviewed by John Freeman on Face to Face; Freeman later said that he had thought before the interview that Moss was a playboy, but in their meeting he showed \\"cold, precise, clinical judgement... a man who could live so close to the edge of death and danger, and trust entirely to his own judgement. This appealed to me\\". Moss also appeared as himself in the 1964 film The Beauty Jungle, and was one of several celebrities with cameo appearances in the 1967 version of the James Bond film Casino Royale. He played Evelyn Tremble's (Peter Sellers) driver.  For many years during and after his career, the rhetorical phrase \\"Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?\\" was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists. Moss relates he himself was once stopped for speeding and asked just that; he reports the traffic officer had some difficulty believing him. As related in the book The Life and Times of Private Eye, Moss was the subject of a less than respectful cartoon biography in the magazine Private Eye. The cartoon, drawn by Willie Rushton, showed him continually crashing, having his driving licence revoked and finally \\"hosting television programmes on subjects he knows nothing about\\". It also made reference to the amnesia Moss suffered from as a result of head injuries sustained in the crash at Goodwood in 1962. According to the book, Moss responded by offering to buy the original of the cartoon, an outcome the book describes as \\"depressingly common\\" for its satirical cartoons about famous people.  Moss is the narrator of the popular children's series Roary the Racing Car which stars Peter Kay, a role he took on, having been approached by both David Jenkins, who had the original idea, and Keith Chapman, the latter the creator of Bob the Builder, as he saw the TV show as a way of introducing motorsport to the next generation.  He is one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content. Moss is also a supporter of the UK Independence Party. What did the public think of Stirling Moss?","output":"In the article, it is mentioned that during his driving career, Moss was one of the most recognized celebrities in Britain.

Dennis loved to paint but William preferred crayons since they left no mess, so","output":"the two brothers often debated their chosen mediums. Their small home, nestled in the quiet suburb of Stowford, almost seemed to vibrate with the amalgamation of colors seeping through its walls. One lazy summer afternoon, as the sun cast golden beams upon the dusty windowpane, the siblings decided to bring their friendly rivalry to life in a challenge that would change their artistic journey forever. Dennis and William would each illustrate a grand mural that represented their respective love for paint and crayons, and they agreed that the entire town would participate in voting for their favorite piece. Even Mrs. Taylor, the boys' elderly neighbor, who had always found their artistic bickering rather amusing, was delighted to learn about the challenge. In no time, word of the competition spread throughout Stowford. It seemed as if the whole town was buzzing with excitement, eagerly waiting for the final reveal. The challenge began, and as each brother prepared his materials, they delved deep into their creative minds to develop the concepts for their murals. Dennis envisioned a vibrant landscape of rolling hills, intricately woven with delicate flowers, where the sky melted into a brilliant orange and pink. This whimsical world would dance upon the canvas to celebrate the endless possibilities that lay within the bristles of his fine brushes and the magic of wet paint. William, on the other hand, sought something more abstract. A true celebration of the raw, visceral nature of crayons, his mural would consist of an intricate and vivid tapestry with geometric patterns connecting one patch of color to another. He would use an ever-changing quilt of shapes and shades to showcase the timeless simplicity of crayons. He wanted to prove how crayons could create a visual masterpiece without the mess and fuss of paint. Days turned into weeks as Dennis and William toiled away. Their home was transformed into two distinct realms: the fragrant aroma of oil paint hung heavy in the air of Dennis' corner, while the scratchy sound of crayons on paper accompanied William in his creative space. Soon, the much-anticipated day arrived when the brothers pulled the drapes from their finished masterpieces. The inhabitants of Stowford had gathered in the brothers' backyard, their eager eyes surveying each piece of art intently. Dennis' landscape was an undeniable explosion of color and vibrancy. The flowers seemed to sway in the breeze as the sun dipped below the horizon, its golden rays reflecting brilliantly against the paint as if time itself was captured through each vivid stroke. The crowd gasped in awe as they took in the sheer depth and detail interwoven throughout Dennis' masterpiece. William's creation was vastly different yet no less entrancing. The geometric patterns of his crayon mosaic drew the eye and mind into a labyrinth of color and shapes that seemed to defy reality. Each crayon stroke, individually unremarkable, harmoniously formed an intricate mural that mesmerized the viewers. The simple, clean lines were accentuated by the bold hues chosen, showcasing the power of crayons despite their often juvenile association. The townspeople murmured appreciatively, impressed by the seamless imaging laid before them. The once-friendly competition was now fraught with tension. Stowford had never experienced such an event, and to be tasked with choosing the finest art piece was difficult, to say the least. Hushed conversations filled the room as neighbors debated the merits of paint vs. crayons, and the palpable suspense seemed to hang in the air. As the votes were tallied, Mrs. Taylor stood to announce the winner – her frail voice projecting a surprising strength. To the town's delight, the results were clear: the competition had ended in a tie. The crowd erupted in applause, with many relieved that they didn't have to choose between the brothers' fantastic creations. In that moment, Dennis and William realized that, despite their differing preferences, each medium had its own irrefutable value. The true magic lies not in paint or crayons, but in the artist's ability to channel their passion and bring their vision to life. From that day on, Dennis and William continued their artistic journeys hand in hand, embracing each other's favored medium. The Stowford brothers' artistry went on to make ripples within the art world, encouraging others to push their creative boundaries and celebrate diversity within their own artistic preferences. And while their tastes remained slightly different, the murals painted that day endured within Stowford's memory – a constant reminder that creativity has no bounds and can flourish under the simplest of materials or the most complex."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Premise: Guadeloupe's Shopping Scene The premise focuses on the shopping scene in Guadeloupe, which is a French overseas region located in the Caribbean. The shopping scene here could encompass everything from local markets and boutiques to malls and large-scale shopping centers. It could also include the variety of items available for purchase, such as clothing, jewelry, electronics, souvenirs, and local products. However, the premise does not explicitly state any specific aspect of the shopping scene, such as its size, popularity, or level of activity. The Hypothesis: Guadeloupe has one of the busiest shopping scenes. The hypothesis makes a distinct claim: it states that the shopping scene in Guadeloupe is one of the busiest. This implies that there is a considerable amount of activity involving consumers, merchants, and products. A bustling shopping scene might involve many transactions, high foot traffic in shopping areas, and a diverse array of products and shops available. When comparing the premise with the hypothesis, we can see that they both address the shopping scene in Guadeloupe. However, the premise does not provide any explicit information regarding the level of activity, popularity, or size of the shopping scene. In contrast, the hypothesis specifically claims that the shopping scene is one of the busiest, which is not supported by the information given in the premise. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and it is not possible to tell if Guadeloupe has one of the busiest shopping scenes based on the information provided in the premise alone. To determine whether the hypothesis is accurate, further research and evidence would be needed that directly addresses the level of activity and popularity of Guadeloupe's shopping scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her.

Remy changed their phone number to avoid getting calls from their ex.  Given the context: What will Remy want to do next?  Possible answers: change their name, be left alone, avoid the ex Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it appears that Remy's primary goal is to distance themselves from their ex-partner due to unwanted communication. Changing their phone number is a clear step in achieving this goal, as it restricts the ex-partner's ability to directly contact Remy through phone calls or messages. Moving forward, there are various potential actions that Remy may consider to further ensure their privacy and peace of mind. While changing their name is an option, it is quite an extreme measure that is unlikely to be Remy's immediate next step. Legally changing one's name involves a detailed and often time-consuming process, with the additional burden of updating all personal records, documents, and informing relevant authorities. Instead, Remy may consider less drastic options to create distance from their ex without resorting to such a significant life change. One of Remy's potential next steps could be to simply focus on their own well-being and enjoy their newfound privacy. Remy might want to be left alone to recuperate from the stress of their previous relationship and the badgering they experienced in the process. They could engage in self-care activities, seek support from friends and family, and take time to rediscover their personal interests away from the influence of their ex. In addition to focusing on their well-being, Remy may want to take measures to ensure they can avoid encounters with their ex-partner. This could be accomplished by carefully evaluating their preferred locations for social or recreational activities, and possibly choosing alternative venues that decrease the likelihood of bumping into their ex. Furthermore, Remy might consider having conversations with mutual friends to explain the situation and seek their understanding for not attending events where the ex-partner may be present. In the digital age, Remy may also want to evaluate their social media presence to ensure that their ex-partner cannot access any personal information or updates. They could adjust privacy settings on their social media accounts, block or unfriend their ex, and be cautious about what they share online. Remy may choose to create new accounts or, for a temporary period, deactivate existing ones to increase their level of privacy. Additionally, Remy could explore various ways to further protect their personal information, such as registering for a Google Voice number which forwards calls to their new number without revealing it, or utilizing call-blocking apps to prevent any unwanted calls. This added layer of protection can provide Remy with a sense of security and peace of mind. In conclusion, while Remy has already taken a step towards distancing themselves from their ex by changing their phone number, there are numerous other actions they may consider to maintain their privacy, avoid unwanted interactions with their ex, and focus on their overall well-being. These options typically involve a combination of personal reflection, communication adjustments, location choices, and digital security measures. Ultimately, Remy's primary aim is to regain control of their life and find a sense of peace that allows them to move forward and heal from their past relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Baker’s political consultant wields influence on commuter rail, charter schools\\" Article:","output":"Title: E-mails show Gov. Baker’s political consultant wields influence on commuter rail, charter schools Introduction A recent investigation has uncovered a series of e-mails that reveal a close relationship between Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker's political consultant, John Doe, and decision making in key areas such as commuter rail and charter schools. This article delves into the findings, examining the growing influence of political consultants on policy-making in the state and raises concerns about transparency and conflicts of interest in the administration. E-mail exchanges expose John Doe's involvement in commuter rail contracts Documents obtained through public records request unearthed numerous e-mails between John Doe and officials from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The correspondence suggests that Doe played a significant role in shaping discussions on the awarding of contracts and operations for the state's commuter rail, an area where his clients had business interests. In these e-mails, Doe is seen making recommendations and suggesting strategies for officials to pursue. One example includes his proposal to prioritize a particular company to carry out repair works on rail tracks. This company, it later emerged, was a close associate of Doe's consultancy firm. Critics argue that this relationship raises ethical questions about the influence of private interests on public decision-making. Governor Baker's administration has been quick to defend the nature of the relationship, insisting that John Doe was merely providing valuable input and had no financial stake in the outcome. However, this defense has done little to mitigate concerns about conflicts of interest and the growing influence of political consultants on policy decisions. Influence on charter schools policy The investigation has further revealed that John Doe has been closely involved in the formulation of policy related to charter schools in the state. For years, Governor Baker has been a strong supporter of expanding charter schools, rallying the private sector and other like-minded politicians. As such, John Doe's close association with this policy area also raises questions about conflicts of interest. E-mails between Doe and officials from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) show a high level of involvement in shaping the public narrative around charter schools. In some instances, Doe has provided feedback on how to frame messages around new policy announcements to maximize public support. Moreover, the e-mails also suggest that Doe may have played a role in influencing the criteria for evaluating charter school proposals, in an attempt to give his private clients an advantageous position. These findings, coupled with his apparent influence on commuter rail contracts, shed light on the extent to which political consultants can impact policy across various sectors. Transparency and ethics concerns The emergence of these e-mails has raised concerns about transparency and the role of private interests in public policy making. The lack of disclosure around the nature of John Doe's relationships with both the state government and private clients creates a conflict of interest that poses risks to the integrity and fairness of policy decisions. Some critics have called for more stringent regulations that would require greater transparency around the relationships between political consultants, politicians, and private entities. They argue that clearer rules could help mitigate conflicts of interest and protect the public interest in decision-making processes. Conclusion The recent findings regarding Governor Charlie Baker's political consultant, John Doe, highlight the growing influence of political consultants on policy-making in Massachusetts. The delicate balance between private interests and public policy raises questions over transparency and possible conflicts of interest. It is paramount that stringent regulations and greater transparency are enforced to ensure that political consultants' involvement in decision-making adheres to ethical standards and protects the public interest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These two options fit best with the description of the dog continuing to interact with the mug after standing up. In the first option, the dog finishes the drink and the story continues with the moment involving a lady and a cup with a cake of icing, which could indicate a gathering or party. In the second option, the dog brings another mug to the group, and a girl starts squeezing a lemon into it, which could indicate that they are sharing drinks and preparing more. The other two options are incorrect because they do not directly relate to the dog's interaction with the mug. In the third option, the dog leaves the room, which doesn't logically follow the description of the dog trying to drink from the mug. In the fourth option, a performer returns to their routine, which is unrelated to the dog's action with the mug."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Who is the actor that played in \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and a 2000 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wong? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, there are a few steps that I need to go through: 1. First, I need to determine the actor or actors from the television series \\"Dawson's Creek.\\" This was a popular series with several actors, but since only one actor is asked for in this question, I'll focus on the main figures. 2. After a quick search, I find that the main actors of \\"Dawson's Creek\\" include James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams, and Joshua Jackson. Now I will investigate whether any of them were also in a 2000 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wong. 3. A search for James Wong's filmography brings up a film titled \\"Final Destination\\" released in the year 2000 which fits the criteria mentioned in the question. I'll search for the cast of \\"Final Destination.\\" 4. Upon searching the \\"Final Destination\\" cast, I find that actor Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and others. Focusing on overlapping actors from the two sources we've identified, we find the actor Kerr Smith. 5. Kerr Smith was indeed in both \\"Dawson's Creek\\" (playing Jack McPhee) and \\"Final Destination\\" (playing Carter Horton). So, the actor that played in \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and a 2000 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wong is Kerr Smith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation -1193 = -132*y + 2107 for y, we will isolate y by following these steps: 1. Add 132*y to both sides of the equation:    -1193 + 132*y = -132*y + 132*y + 2107    Simplifying, we get:    132*y - 1193 = 2107 2. Now add 1193 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with y on one side:    132*y - 1193 + 1193 = 2107 + 1193    Simplifying, we get:    132*y = 3300 3. Finally, we will divide both sides of the equation by 132 to solve for y:    (132*y) / 132 = 3300 / 132    Simplifying, we get:    y = 25 So the solution for y is 25."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Darren Wilson's version of what happened when he confronted Michael Brown has expanded since he gave his first recorded interview to detectives, but the key parts have stayed largely the same. Witnesses corroborated and disputed what Wilson said about events leading up to the police officer's fatal shooting of the unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9. Much of the crime scene evidence supports Wilson's story, but there are also some key differences, according to an analysis of available material. Wilson spent 31 minutes being interviewed by police the day after the shooting, about four hours in front of the grand jury, and another 45 minutes talking to George Stephanopoulos of ABC. To both detectives and grand jurors, Wilson said that as","output":"he approached Brown and his friend, he asked them to walk on the sidewalk instead of the street. According to Wilson, Brown reacted aggressively and a struggled ensued. Brown allegedly attempted to take Wilson's gun, leading the officer to fear for his life. Wilson fired his weapon in self-defense, first inside the police car and then outside, as Brown continued to charge towards him. Witnesses presented varying accounts of the incident, with some supporting Wilson's claim of self-defense, while others insisted that Brown posed no immediate threat and had his hands up in a surrender gesture. The inconsistencies in eyewitness testimonies created further confusion and controversy surrounding the case. The crime scene evidence, including the positioning of shell casings and bloodstains, largely supported Wilson's version of events. However, critics argue that the evidence does not conclusively prove that Brown posed a threat or that the officer's use of lethal force was justified. Ultimately, the grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, sparking outrage and reigniting debates about racial bias in the criminal justice system, the use of excessive force by police, and the need for nationwide policing reforms. Despite the lack of formal charges, the Ferguson case remains a focal point in conversations surrounding police accountability and the ongoing pursuit of social justice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hip hop artist Mos Def included the beginning verse of \\"Under the Bridge\\" in the song \\"Brooklyn,\\" from his 1999 record Black on Both Sides. He, however, changed the line \\"the city I live in, the City of Angels\\", which refers to Los Angeles, to \\"the city I live in is beautiful Brooklyn,\\" to match his song's premise.

Hypothesis: A girl is eating at a fancy dinner. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"We cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true because the information given in the premise does not directly support the hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis to understand why this conclusion cannot be drawn. Premise: The girl in a blue dress is eating some blue cotton candy with one shoe off and one shoe on. In the premise, we are provided with the following pieces of information: 1. The girl is wearing a blue dress. 2. She is eating blue cotton candy. 3. She has one shoe off and one shoe on. Hypothesis: A girl is eating at a fancy dinner. The hypothesis suggests that the girl is attending and eating at a fancy dinner. However, based on the information provided in the premise, we cannot conclusively determine whether this hypothesis is true.  1. While the girl is wearing a blue dress, which might be considered appropriate attire for a fancy dinner, the color or type of dress alone does not guarantee that the event she is attending is a fancy dinner. 2. The girl is eating blue cotton candy, which is an informal, carnival-style snack rather than a typical food item found at a fancy dinner. The presence of cotton candy suggests a more casual event or setting rather than a formal dinner. 3. The fact that the girl has one shoe off and one shoe on also does not support the hypothesis of her attending a fancy dinner. This detail indicates an informal and potentially playful or relaxed situation, whereas people at a fancy dinner would typically be expected to have both shoes on and maintain a more formal appearance. In conclusion, the information provided in the premise does not sufficiently support or prove the hypothesis. While some elements, such as the girl wearing a blue dress, might be consistent with a fancy dinner scenario, the presence of blue cotton candy and the girl's informal footwear situation do not align with our expectations of a formal dinner setting.

Casually propped against a wall, the two rocket launchers and hunting rifle below are just some of a cache of guns inside the home of 'weapons mad' Belgian killer Nordine Amrani. The arsenal was uncovered by police during a raid of the gunman's home during October 2007 and also includes several other powerful rifles, ammunition, and what appears to be a flak jacket. Amrani, who on Tuesday murdered four people and wounded 125 others, also used his home in the city of Liege as a cannabis factory, with police finding more than 2,800 plants during the raid. Scroll down for video... Pictured is a room in Amrani's flat raided by police in October 2007 showing various weapons and military style clothing. Firearms: Pictured are just part of the weapons cache police found at Amrani's flat in October 2007. Plantation: Police found a cannabis den containing 2,800 plants in a shed owned by Amrani in 2007. Amrani had rigged up special lighting and was growing more than 2,000 plants in a shed discovered by police. Yesterday, Amrani's lawyer said he carried out the attack because he feared being sent to back to prison for a sex crime. Killer: Nordine Amrani murdered a cleaning lady in his rented flat before heading off on a bloodthirsty rampage in the centre of the Belgian city. The. 32-year-old convicted criminal, who was due to marry his long-term. girlfriend, used grenades and a semi-automatic rifle to cause carnage in. the Belgian city before turning a revolver on himself. Among. his victims was a 45-year-old cleaning lady whom he shot dead near his. home on Tuesday morning, as well as a 17-month old baby boy. Defence. lawyer Jean-Francois Dister said Amrani, a Belgian from a Moroccan. background, was on parole and was due to answer a summons about. allegedly ‘sexually molesting’  a young woman. He is thought to have attacked the unnamed victim after driving alongside her in his van. Its number plate was captured by CCTV. One of Amrani’s numerous previous convictions was for rape, for which he had been given a two-year suspended sentence in 2003. If convicted again for a sex crime, he would have had to serve it. This would have also meant his girlfriend, a nurse called Perrin Balon, finding out about the sex allegations against him. ‘He feared being returned to prison,’said Mr Dister. ‘He called me twice on Monday afternoon and on Tuesday morning about it. ‘What worried him most was to be jailed again. According to my client it was a set-up by people who wanted to harm him. Mr Amrani had a grudge against the law. 'He thought he had been wrongfully convicted.’ After. Tuesday’s attack, the bag Amrani used to carry his haul of weapons was. found to still contain several loaded magazines, as well as a number of. live grenades. An enquiry has been launched into why he had not been under closer. supervision while on bail after early release from a sentence of nearly. five years. His weapons were confiscated because of his other criminal offences, yet. he managed to obtain a FAL Belgian assault rifle, grenades and other. weapons soon after his release in October 2010. Belgian’s. notoriously liberal criminal justice system is already facing questions. as to why, in October 2010, the killer had been released from prison. three years early after being convicted of firearms and drug offences. Destroyed: Bomb disposal experts created a controlled explosion on the killer's car after finding it parked up in Liege. Police last night conducted thorough searches of a building owned by Nordine Amrani (left) and his flat (right) Looking: Police pictured searching through Nordine Amrani's apartment last night. In. 2008 he had been found guilty of keeping 10 complete firearms, and an. astonishing 9,500 gun parts in his flat, along with 2,800 cannabis. plants nearby. On Tuesday morning, Amrani is thought. to have tried to rape the woman cleaner in his flat, where police had. found an arsenal of weapons including a rocket launcher, AK47 and. Kalashnikov. Police said he. killed her 'with a bullet to her head' and then dumped her body in a. lock-up shed where he was growing cannabis plants. He then left money for Ms Balon, with a note that said: 'Good luck! I love you.' A police source said: 'The cleaner had been working in a neighbour's home. It appears that Amrani had invited her into his own flat to discuss the possibility of cleaning his flat. 'There were signs of a struggle, and it may be that Amrani had tried to rape her. 'Whatever happened, she was undoubtedly his first murder victim on Tuesday morning.' Cedric Visart Bocarme, the Belgian. Attorney General, confirmed that the woman 'would have been murdered by. the killer just before he went to Place Saint-Lambert'. The. attack brought horror to Belgium's fifth largest city, with crowds of. shoppers, many of them children, screaming and running in panic as. grenades exploded and shots rang out. Mourning: A woman places a cuddly toy in a broken bus shelter in the Place Saint-Lambert in Liege. Grief: Five people, including the gunman himself, died in the incident which is being mourned by Belgians. Tributes: People were yesterday morning seen leaving flowers at the scene of the deadly grenade attack in Liege. Clean up: Workers yesterday started to clean up the debris from the rampage. Injured: Cynthia Cannella was wounded in the attack. Today, a small crowd gathered at the Place Saint-Lambert for a minute's silence at 12noon, 24 hours after the shooting. Students at the Saint Barthelemy High School - attended by two of the victims - also joined hands and observed the silence. Abdelhadi Amrani, another lawyer who worked for the killer but is not related, said he had grown up in foster homes after being orphaned as a child. ‘I remember a man deeply marked by the loss of his parents,’ said Ms Amrani. ‘He lost his father and mother very early. He was marked by fate. ‘I would add he was a very smart boy, gifted. 'Nordine often spoke of his desire to start a family. He was to be married to a nurse in Liege.’ Commenting on Amrani’s background, Ms Amrani said: ‘He did not feel at all Moroccan. He did not speak a word of Arabic, and was not Muslim. What he said is that he felt like a Belgian. ‘He was crazy about weapons, but as a. collector. 'He felt he had not had much luck in life and felt unfairly. treated by the courts. 'This was the fed-up cry of a tormented soul – he was estranged from justice, and against society.’ A 17-month-old baby boy called Gabriel. became the fourth victim after dying in hospital late on Tuesday night. despite undergoing hours of emergency treatment. Gabriel was in the arms of his mother. when he was hit by a bullet in the back of the head. The child and his. parents were at the bus stop just below the walkway from where Amrani. opened fire. Amrani had been due to attend a police interview in the late morning but never showed up. Instead. he left his apartment armed with a Belgian-made FN- FAL automatic. rifle, a handgun and up to a dozen grenades carried in a backpack. He. drove the five-minute journey from his 1930s apartment building the. Residence Belvedere and parked his white van in Place St Lambert. He walked on to a raised walkway above a bus stop where lunchtime shoppers were thronging for the opening of a Christmas market. From. his 15ft high vantage point he lobbed three hand grenades towards a. busy bus shelter before opening fire on the crowd. A 15-year-old boy. died instantly while the baby of 17 months and a 17-year-old boy. succumbed to their injuries in hospital. Five. people are still fighting for their lives, including a 75-year old. woman who was initially declared dead on arrival at hospital. Stopped in his tracks: A body, thought to be gunman Nordine Amrani, lies on the pavement close to a gun and full clips of ammunition. It is unknown whether Amrani killed himself deliberately or accidentally. Chaos: Police watch out for the gunman (left) as paramedics attend to the injured (right) A body on a roof overlooking the square in Liege is believed to be that of attacker Nordine Amrani, a convicted sex attacker and drug dealer. Rescuers evacuate injured people at the Place Saint Lambert square. Belgium's King Albert II, centre, and his wife Queen Paola arrived in Liege on Tuesday night to visit the injured.

Movie title: The 51st State Movie plot: Alternate poster and title for the film The Fifty First State In 1971, a policeman catches Elmo McElroy, a recent college graduate with a degree in pharmacology, smoking marijuana. Because of his arrest and conviction, he is unable to find work as a pharmacologist. In the present day, a drug lord called \\"the Lizard\\" calls a meeting of his organisation, hoping to sell a brand new substance invented by Elmo. The meeting goes badly when Elmo, in a bid to escape from the Lizard's control, blows up the building, killing everyone but the Lizard. Vengeful, the Lizard contacts Dakota, a contract killer, who previously killed the only witness in a case against the Lizard. Dakota initially refuses the hit, but accepts when the Lizard offers to clear her gambling debts and give her a 250,000 bonus. Elmo leaves for Liverpool, England, where he meets Felix DeSouza, a local \\"fixer\\" who has been sent by Leopold Durant, head of a local criminal organisation, in exchange for two football tickets to a sold-out game. At the meeting, Elmo pitches POS 51, a synthetic drug that can be produced with minimal facilities and is 51 times as potent as other drugs. A second opinion from Pudsey, Durant's chemist, confirms Elmo's claims, and Durant gives him over a million dollars in bonds. Since it is 18 million short of the agreed payment, Elmo threatens to leave. In a room across the street, Dakota is about to take a shot at Elmo's head when the Lizard calls cancelling the hit; not wanting to kill Elmo until he has the formula. Instead of killing Elmo, she is to kill anyone who meets with him. She switches rifles to an automatic weapon and kills everyone but Elmo and Felix, who is shot in the buttocks. As Elmo and Felix leave the hotel, a gang of skinheads who seek the drug attack them. Elmo protects them with a golf club. Detective Virgil Kane arrives on the scene and gives a chase.

We can do this by adding 162*v to both sides of the equation. Here are the steps to solve the equation: 1. Start with the equation:    -159*v + 9 = -162*v 2.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union.

He says Dominicans don’t like black people. That’s not true.” De Blasio hosted a press conference in June to condemn the looming deportations of thousands of people of Haitian descent from the Dominican Republic. “It is clearly an illegal act. It is an immoral act. It is a racist act by the Dominican government,” he said at the time. While he was backed by both Dominican and Haitian elected officials, he drew the ire of Dominican-Americans. Deyanira Martinez, 45, of Manhattan, called de Blasio a “traitor.” “We all voted for you!” she said. De Blasio wouldn’t answer questions Sunday, but last week he stood by his comments and said the international opposition to the Dominican government’s policies had a positive impact. “If that situation is improving in the Dominican Republic, it’s because there was a public outcry. And I’m very comfortable with the fact that that had to be called out,” he said.

Answer:","output":"Car exhaust fumes contain a variety of harmful gases and air pollutants, but the most commonly known poisonous gas found in them is carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas, which makes it particularly dangerous for humans and animals, as it cannot be easily detected.  When fuel is burned in an internal combustion engine, a chemical reaction occurs between the hydrocarbon-based fuel and the oxygen in the air. This produces various exhaust byproducts, with carbon monoxide being one of them. The combustion process is typically not perfect, leading to incomplete burning of fuel and the production of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is poisonous because it has the ability to tightly bind with the hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hemoglobin's primary function is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body's cells and tissues. However, when carbon monoxide is present, it interferes with this process due to its higher binding affinity to hemoglobin than oxygen. As a result, it displaces oxygen and forms carboxyhemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues throughout the body. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide can cause symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, and even unconsciousness. In severe cases or high concentrations, it can ultimately lead to death due to oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia. Aside from carbon monoxide, car exhaust fumes also contain other harmful components, including: 1. Nitrogen oxides (NOx): These compounds contribute to smog formation, respiratory problems, and the production of acid rain. Diesel engines, in particular, emit higher levels of nitrogen oxides. 2. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): These are various hydrocarbon-based compounds that can evaporate from fuel and other vehicle components. Many VOCs are hazardous to human health and contribute to the formation of smog. 3. Particulate matter (PM): This refers to the tiny particles, dust, and soot contained in exhaust emissions. These small particles can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. 4. Sulfur dioxide (SO2): This is primarily produced when burning fuels with high sulfur content, such as diesel. It contributes to the formation of acid rain and can cause respiratory issues. 5. Greenhouse gases: Burning fossil fuels in vehicles also produces greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which contribute significantly to climate change. Many countries and regions have implemented strict regulations to reduce the emission of these harmful pollutants, and vehicle manufacturers are turning to cleaner technologies, such as electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, as well as improving traditional combustion engines to emit fewer pollutants. Also, catalytic converters installed in modern vehicles help convert some of these harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, into less harmful substances like carbon dioxide and water vapor. However, more effort is needed worldwide to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel-powered vehicles and further decrease the health risks and environmental damage caused by car exhaust fumes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One night, while researching in the library's restricted section, she stumbles upon an ancient book that seemingly revolves around Dracula's origin and his eternal quest for love. Unbeknownst to Mina, she inadvertently summons Dracula through a ritual mentioned in the book. The first encounter between Mina and the vampire lord takes place when he saves her from a group of drunken men trying to harm her. Unaware of Dracula's true identity, Mina feels a strange connection with her enigmatic savior. Meanwhile, Dracula sees a striking resemblance between Mina and his long-lost love and becomes obsessed with her. Act 2: Whispers of the Night As Mina starts to experience a series of uncanny incidents after her meeting with Dracula, she crosses paths with Jonathan Harker, a charismatic, young researcher, who shares her passion for unearthing the truth behind local legends. The two eventually fall in love, but their happiness is short-lived, as Dracula's lurking presence starts to haunt Mina's life. One fateful night, Dracula confronts Mina and Jonathan in the throes of their passion, revealing his true self and intent to make Mina his eternal companion. In a swift move, Dracula bites Mina, infusing her with his powers and curse. Jonathan tries to save her but is overpowered by Dracula, and the two are left with no choice but to flee. Act 3: Darkness Within Mina's health rapidly deteriorates after being bitten by Dracula. She starts experiencing bloodlust and supernatural abilities. Jonathan, desperate to save her, seeks the help of Van Helsing, an enigmatic professor with knowledge of the dark arts. Together, they discover that Mina's transition into a vampire can be halted, but they must act soon. To accomplish this, they need to find and destroy the source of Dracula's powers – his ancient tomb, which also binds him to his eternal existence. As Mina and Jonathan, along with a hesitant Van Helsing, embark on their quest, Dracula's vampire minions give chase, resulting in a series of battles, betrayals, and shocking revelations. Through these trials, Mina grapples with her conflicting emotions for Dracula and her love for Jonathan, realizing that the vampire lord yearns only for the love he lost centuries ago, but is misguided in his method of pursuing it. Act 4: The Shadow's End In a climactic battle at Dracula's tomb, Mina's newfound powers give her the upper hand against the vampire minions. However, as she confronts Dracula himself, her feelings of sympathy for him make her hesitate. As the castle collapses around them, Mina is finally able to convince Dracula to make amends and end the cycle of suffering he has caused. Dracula, moved by Mina's compassion and realizing the depths of her love for Jonathan, sacrifices himself to save her and destroy the source of his powers, freeing her from the curse. In the aftermath, Mina and Jonathan return to their lives, scarred but hopeful for the future. However, Mina is forever changed by her experiences and can't help but feel a certain sadness for the tragic love story of Dracula, her once-bitter enemy but ultimately, her savior. Eternal Shadows delivers a suspenseful, gothic narrative combining horror, romance, and the undeniable impact of love and forgiveness even in the darkest of times. The haunting tale weaves a complex web of emotions and relationships, leaving audiences riveted until the very end."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The campers brought the snacks to the road trip but forgot the supplies because the  Options: a). snacks were hidden. b). supplies were hidden.","output":"The campers, a group of seven men and women in their late twenties, had meticulously planned a road trip across the country for months. They had spent countless evenings, planning the journey, marking spots on the maps, and making a list of essentials they needed to carry. An assortment of delightful snacks came on top of that list. As the day of their journey dawned, they woke up excited and full of anticipation, their hearts ablaze with dreams of picturesque landscapes and the taste of adventure. They packed their snacks in the early hours of the morning. It was a varied collection of chips, granola bars, trail mix, chocolates, and little packets of local confectionery from their native town that they were keen on sharing with the new people they would meet on their journey. The snacks were thoughtfully and carefully dispersed though various bags and pockets, ensuring they were never too far from a quick bite. The idea was that no matter where they were or what they were doing in the trip, a little rummage through the nearest bag would always reward them with something to munch on. It was an innovative system that they were quite proud of.  Admirable as such efficient snack storage was, it did lead to one significant oversight: leaving room for other supplies. Amidst the pre-departure buzz and the unprecedented excitement of hiding snacks in every nook and corner of the van, the campers completely forgot to bring the other essential supplies. It was several miles into the journey when they first realized their mistake. When they stopped for a picnic at a sun-drenched clearing in a forest, they began to unpack what they thought were their supplies - only to discover more and more snack stashes. A quick search of the entire van confirmed it. They had forgotten to load their gear, the basic necessities like bottled water, a first-aid kit, toiletries, bedding, their camping gear, and even their clothes. This realization set in with a poignant mix of laughter and horror. How did they manage to be so obliviously focused on snacks that they forgot to pack their supplies? They wondered if they should continue the journey, make do with what they had, or turn back home, resupply, and restart their trip. Learning from their memorable and amusing mistake, the group decided to return home to pack all the necessary supplies. They laughed the entire way home, munching on the amply available snacks, grateful for the humor in the situation and the reiteration of the importance of proper packing. From then on, they carefully double-checked their supplies before leaving on any of their adventures.  The mishap of the forgotten supplies turned into a story they’d tell and retell at every camping occasion in the future, instantly becoming a campfire classic and a road trip anecdote remembered for many years to come. They embraced the hilarity of the situation, accepting it as an unexpected, yet entertaining, twist at the start of an adventurous road trip."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: When Grace Slick wrote “White Rabbit” in late 1965, she never imagined the song would pave the way for psychedelic rock and inspire several generations of lead female rock singers, including Pink, who covers it in the new film “Alice Through the Looking Glass.” Released originally by Jefferson Airplane in February 1967 on its “Surrealistic Pillow” album and then as a single that June, “White Rabbit” peaked at No. 8 on Billboard’s pop chart. The brooding bolero has been interpreted by dozens of rock and jazz artists and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. Earlier this year, Ms. Slick, 76, spoke about the song she composed on a red piano and her trippy lyrics based on “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Grace Slick: In the summer of 1965, I was living with my husband, Jerry Slick, in Larkspur, Calif., about a half-hour north of San Francisco. I was 25 and working as a couture model at I. Magnin in San Francisco while Jerry was making short films. We didn’t have much money. At I. Magnin, I had to change into expensive clothes every 10 minutes and walk around as rich old ladies felt the fabric and asked what the dress cost. If a woman bought the dress, the store would make one up for her nine sizes larger than I was. San Francisco was saturated with music then. Haight-Ashbury was a draw for kids, and bands were there from all over the country. In September ’65, Jerry and I went to the Matrix to hear a new band—Jefferson Airplane. Signe Anderson was the Airplane’s lead singer, and as I watched, I decided that singing might be way more fun than modeling. So we started a band. Jerry had a set of drums and his brother Darby knew how to play guitar. Our friend David Miner could sing and play guitar, Bard DuPont played bass and Peter van Gelder played sax and flute. We named the band the Great Society—sort of a snarky take on Lyndon Johnson’s social program. That fall, I found a small upright piano for 80 at a warehouse in San Francisco. It was painted about 90 coats of bright red and was missing around 10 keys in the upper register. I didn’t play way up there anyway—the notes were too pingy—so I bought it. Jerry and I put the piano in our living room. Our first gig was at North Beach’s Coffee Gallery in October ’65. I quit my modeling job and started writing music for the band. I didn’t really play piano—I’d write lyrics and bang around until I came up with chord progressions. The more the band gigged, the more media coverage we got. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, I argued in favor of marijuana and LSD, and somehow the article got back to my parents. It was painful for them, I’m sure, but I didn’t care whether they minded. Parents were criticizing a generation’s choices while sitting there with their glasses of scotch. They also seemed unaware that many books they read to us as kids had drug use as a subtext. Peter Pan uses fairy dust and can fly, Dorothy and her friends in “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” cut through a poppy field and wind up stoned and fast asleep. I loved “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” The stuff Alice drank and ate made her high [tall] or brought her down [small]. There were all kinds of drug metaphors in there. The ’60s were very much like that. One afternoon in December or January, while Jerry was out, I started writing a song about Alice and all the drug references in the story. I wrote the lyrics first. As I wrote, I’d read them out loud to be sure my voice could form a cadence [Ms. Slick sings slowly to illustrate: “One pill makes you larger / And one pill makes you small / And the ones that mother gives you / Don’t do anything at all”]. When the lyrics were done, I took the sheet of paper to the red piano and worked on the chords, writing the names of the ones I liked over the phrases. I wrote the song in F-sharp minor, a key that’s ideal for my voice. Minor chords have a certain darkness and sadness. The music I came up with was based on a slow Spanish march or bolero that builds in intensity. I’ve always had a thing for Spanish folk music. Back in 1963, Jerry and I were living with Darby and his girlfriend in San Francisco on Potrero Hill. One day we took acid and I put on Miles Davis’s “Sketches of Spain.” I loved that album and I listened to it over and over for hours, particularly “Concierto de Aranjuez,” which takes up most of the first side. It’s hypnotic. I’ve always been like this. Anything I love I’m going to cram into my ears, nose and mouth until I use it up. “Sketches of Spain” was drilled into my head and came squirting out in various ways as I wrote “White Rabbit.” With the chorus—the Alice lines, like “Go ask Alice, when she’s 10 feet tall”—I shifted to major chords for a release and to celebrate Alice’s courage following the white rabbit down the hole. Once down there she didn’t have a Prince Charming. She had to save her own ass while going through all the insane hallucinogenic stuff. I identified with Alice. I was a product of ’50s America in Palo Alto, Calif., where women were housewives with short hair and everything was highly regulated. I went from the planned, bland ’50s to the world of being in a rock band without looking back. It was my Alice moment, heading down the hole. “White Rabbit” seemed like an appropriate title. When I finished the song, I made copies by hand of the lyrics and chord names for the band. I sat at the piano and sang and played the song for the guys. Then they followed on acoustic instruments, to keep the noise down. We first performed “White Rabbit” in early ’66 at a dive bar on Broadway in San Francisco. Each night we’d play four 30-minute sets for a handful of drunk sailors at the bar, or our friends would drop by to listen. We didn’t cover other bands’ stuff. That was a fast way to wind up playing at the Holiday Inn forever. The challenge was to write what you felt. At the dive bar, if the drunken sailors weren’t aware we were playing, our original songs were probably in pretty good shape. Within a few months we went from dive bars to opening for the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Janis [Joplin] and other artists at local auditoriums and theaters. We performed “White Rabbit” at places like the Fillmore, Longshoremen’s Hall and the Matrix. At one point, we made a series of demos at Golden State Recorders for Autumn Records. [Label co-owner] Tom Donahue had Sly Stone come in to help us. We were so bad that Sly eventually played all the instruments so the demo would sound OK. By the summer of ’66, some of the guys were talking about leaving the Great Society to study the sitar in India. I figured the band’s days were numbered. In October, Jack Casady, the Airplane’s bassist, came up to me at the Carousel Ballroom, where we had opened for the band. Jack said Signe was leaving to raise her baby daughter and asked if I wanted to replace her. Initially I was shocked but it took me about two seconds to say yes. Down the rabbit hole, again. Jack, Marty Balin, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Spencer Dryden were way ahead of the Great Society in terms of musicianship. Jerry was in film school by then, so he didn’t mind. When I joined the Airplane in October ’66, I brought over “Somebody to Love,” which Darby had written, and “White Rabbit.” Audiences liked the songs when the Great Society had performed them. They were a good fit for Airplane. On “White Rabbit,” the Airplane was better at designing an instrumental idea. There was never a specific guitar solo for “White Rabbit.” In concert, there might be a jam in the beginning but my vocal always ran about 2½ minutes. People in the audience thought I moved around on stage like a panther. I’m actually a klutz. The reason I moved so carefully was to avoid tripping and breaking my neck. In November ’66, we recorded “Surrealistic Pillow” at RCA in Los Angeles. After we recorded “White Rabbit,” we all went into the control room to hear the playback on the monitor speakers. I was blown away. I wasn’t aware I sounded like that, with all that power. I was impressed. I always felt like a good-looking schoolteacher singing “White Rabbit.” I sang the words slowly and precisely, so the people who needed to hear them wouldn’t miss the point. But they did. To this day, I don’t think most people realize the song was aimed at parents who drank and told their kids not to do drugs. I felt they were full of crap, but to write a good song, you need a few more words than that. After the “White Rabbit” single came out, RCA told us each week where the record stood on the charts. I didn’t pay much attention. I didn’t set out to write a hit single, and I felt that radio only liked “White Rabbit” because it was short and they could get more ads in. Looking back, I think “White Rabbit” is a very good song. I’m not a genius but I don’t suck. My only complaint is that the lyrics could have been stronger. If I had done it right, more people would have been annoyed.

The Seven Summits are the tallest peaks on each of the Earth's continents. Comes after service was in January expanded to include the Grand Canyon. Article:","output":"Title: Google Street View Explores the Majestic Heights of the World's Seven Summits Introduction In a remarkable feat, Google has now extended its Street View capabilities to cover four of the world's Seven Summits. The Seven Summits are the tallest peaks on each of the Earth's continents, and Google's impressive expansion comes on the heels of its January update, which included the awe-inspiring Grand Canyon. This latest development has not only elevated the technology giant's mapping prowess but also paved the way for virtual travelers to experience the wonder of these breathtaking summits. Exploring the Summits The world's Seven Summits comprise Mount Everest in Asia, Aconcagua in South America, Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Vinson Massif in Antarctica, and Carstensz Pyramid in Australia/Oceania. Google Street View, known for bringing global locations to life with its 360-degree panoramic images, has made it possible for people to virtually explore the landscapes and trails leading to four of these magnificent peaks. The incredible visual journey begins with Aconcagua in Argentina, South America's highest peak at an elevation of 22,841 feet, allowing adventurers to marvel at the surreal snow-capped mountains and rocky terrains of this gigantic summit. Moving on to North America, Google Street View takes viewers to Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley, in Alaska, showcasing the rugged beauty of its glaciers, icy crevasses, and some of the harshest weather conditions on our planet. In Africa, Kilimanjaro, with its height of 19,341 feet, is captured in its entirety by Google Street View, unveiling its multiple ecological zones and intriguing plant life. Finally, Europe's highest point, Mount Elbrus, located in the Caucasus Mountain range in Russia, is also now mapped with Google's technology, offering a virtual passage through its icy and wind-swept landscapes. Technological Advancements and Challenges Google's constant innovation has been commendable, and expanding its Street View services to the world's highest points is an obvious testament to that. This has been made possible by the company's ongoing improvements to its Trekker hardware, a wearable backpack mounted with a camera system, allowing individuals to capture images while exploring hard-to-reach locations. However, capturing these stunning panoramas of the world's Seven Summits was not an easy task. Google faced challenges ranging from extreme weather conditions, such as freezing temperatures and high winds, to the physical limitations posed by such high altitudes. Nevertheless, its commitment to enhancing the user experience has made it all possible, setting new standards for online exploration. The Future of Virtual Exploration With this latest update to Google Street View, the possibilities for virtual exploration have expanded exponentially. Armchair adventurers can now marvel at some of the most stunning and remote locations without leaving the comfort of their homes, all thanks to Google's unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. By incorporating four of the world's seven highest peaks, Google has set the stage for further expansion – potentially covering the remaining summits, including the monumental Mount Everest. As the technology continues to advance, we can only imagine what other hidden treasures await us in the virtual realm, as Google Street View seeks to conquer the world's greatest landscapes and promote the shared experience of our planet's natural wonders."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: A scientist is in the lab testing mixing water with different chemicals. While working with chemical A he notes that the water becomes colder after combining them. With chemical B the water becomes much warmer.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which of the two chemicals causes an endothermic process, chemical A or chemical B?  Hint: Some materials have negative heats of solution; the dissolution of one of these solutes in water is an exothermic process. Heat is released, causing a net increase in the temperature of the solution. Conversely, other substances have positive heats of solution. For example, the dissolution of potassium nitrate in water is an endothermic process. The resulting absorption of energy causes the solution to become colder. Calculations involving heats of solutions follow the same basic approach that we have used with other enthalpy problems. Answer:","output":"Chemical A causes an endothermic process. An endothermic process is one that absorbs heat from its surroundings, resulting in a decrease in temperature. In the given scenario, when chemical A is mixed with water, the temperature of the solution decreases, indicating that heat is being absorbed from the surroundings, which is characteristic of an endothermic process. On the other hand, chemical B causes the water to become much warmer when mixed. This suggests an exothermic process, where heat is released to the surroundings, resulting in an increase in temperature. The hint provided explains that substances with positive heats of solution cause endothermic processes, where energy is absorbed, as in the case of potassium nitrate dissolving in water. Similarly, substances with negative heats of solution result in exothermic processes, where heat is released, and the temperature of the solution increases. Therefore, based on the observed temperature changes, chemical A is responsible for the endothermic process, while chemical B is responsible for the exothermic process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees.

Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.      Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.      \\"We have bodies. Come and examine them,\\" he said. \\"It is clear they are missing certain parts.\\"      He also said a dozen doctors have been \\"executed\\" in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.      Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of \\"crimes of genocide\\" in targeting certain ethnic groups.      The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.      Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that \\"it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.\\" He used an acronym for the group.      He said Iraq's most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.      \\"Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,\\" Mladenov said. ||||| Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. claimed Wednesday that ISIS has been forcing doctors to harvest organs from the bodies of the people it's killed, and then selling those organs to fund its operations, according to an AP report. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim called for a Security Council investigation into alleged mass graves full of bodies with surgical scars and missing kidneys.      According to Alkalim, a dozen doctors have been killed in Mosul because they wouldn't take part in the Islamic State's organ trafficking scheme.      Unconfirmed rumors of ISIS removing and selling organs have been around since at least December, when Middle East news outlet Al-Monitor published an article with more detailed claims than Alkalim made this week.      Based on a report from one doctor in Mosul, Al-Monitor wrote:      Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs ... the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped. He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said.      The Al-Monitor story also claims that the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed \\"the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest,\\" a claim that was widely repeated by news sites in December, but seems to be based entirely on this single source. (As far as I can tell, there's no mention of the trafficking operation in OHCHR's published reports on Iraq, and Alkalim didn't mention OHCHR in his statement to the Security Council.)      The Islamic State is incredibly money-hungry, Newsweek reported in a detailed look at the revenue streams ISIS uses to support the 8 million people in its territories, including more than 10,000 active fighters. There's no mention of selling kidneys, but ISIS needs all the money it can get, and if they're willing to conduct small-time local kidnappings for as little as 500, moving organs isn't so farfetched.      There's still no conclusive evidence, though. The Islamic State is the international boogeyman of the moment, and its confirmed actions are heinous enough to make any rumor sound plausible, but it's also been the subject of several online hoaxes and conspiracy theories.      It's probably best to withhold judgment until the U.N. does what Alkahim suggests and examines the bodies.

Question 1: What does OBC mean in KVPY? Question 2: How dangerous is a Rottweiler/Boxer mix? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They concern two completely different topics.  Question 1, \\"What does OBC mean in KVPY?\\" is asking about a specific term in the context of an educational program in India.  KVPY, or the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana, is a scholarship program in India that is funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and administered by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). This program aims to encourage students to take up research careers in the field of basic sciences.  OBC, in the context of KVPY or any other Indian educational context, stands for Other Backward Class. This is a collective term used by the Indian government to classify castes which are socially and educationally disadvantaged. It is one of several official classifications of the population of India, along with Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC and ST). The OBC classification is mainly significant in the context of the reservation policy of the Indian government, where a certain percentage of seats is reserved in the publicly funded educational institutions and in jobs under the state and central government for the socially and educationally backward classes. Question 2, \\"How dangerous is a Rottweiler/Boxer mix?\\" is a completely different type of question and it's related to dog breeds and their behavior. A Rottweiler/Boxer mix is a hybrid dog breed resulting from the crossing of a Rottweiler and a Boxer. The temperament of the resulting mix can vary depending on the traits inherited from each of its parent breeds.  As individual breeds, Rottweilers and Boxers are both known for their strength, intelligence, and loyalty. They're also both known to be protective, which can make them excellent guard dogs. However, their protective nature can sometimes be seen as aggression, especially if the dog isn't properly socialized or trained.  The perceived \\"danger\\" of a Rottweiler/Boxer mix, or indeed any dog breed, isn't just about the breed itself. A lot depends on individual temperament, how the dog has been raised and trained, and how well its needs are being met in terms of exercise, mental stimulation, and social interaction. Any dog, regardless of breed, can become dangerous if it's mistreated, neglected, or not properly trained and socialized.  So, in conclusion, these questions are asking about utterly distinct matters — one is asking about a term in the Indian reservation and educational context, and the other is about the general behavior of a specific hybrid breed of dogs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Amsterdam runs to join children on the steps of a nearby building, while the Dead Rabbits await the arrival of the Natives. A few moments later, men dressed in blue, The Natives, led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a ruthless New Yorker with a glass eye, walk onto the street, clearly outnumbering the Rabbits. Bill says that the ensuing fight will decide who holds the rule of the Five Points; Bill's mob who are Protestant or Vallon's Catholics. Vallon recants that it's a free country, that he and his immigrant crowd have been harassed incessantly by Bill and his men. The Rabbits are then joined by several other gangs that have allied themselves with Vallon, greatly increasing their numbers.Moments later, they begin fighting.

Article:Jutkiewicz's first goal for Blues - and first since May 2014 - came moments after Adthe Nuhiu had headed against the crossbar for visitors Wednesday. Gary Hooper had given them the lead going in to the closing stages from Steven Fletcher's clever back heel. Clayton Donaldson then levelled soon after from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Keiren Westwood. Media playback is not supported on this device The game at St Andrew's suddenly came to life in the closing 15 minutes after the main talking point had been Birmingham's appeals for a penalty in the first half. Former Owls winger Jacques Maghoma appeared to have been tripped by Tom Lees on the edge of the area after he squared the ball. Birmingham's protests went unanswered and their hopes of taking any points from the game appeared dashed when Wednesday led through substitute Hooper. They were behind for just five minutes as Donaldson picked himself up to send Westwood the wrong way from 12 yards, having been clipped by the goalkeeper rushing off his line. It was another substitute who had the final say as Jutkiewicz, on loan from Burnley, suddenly found space to loop his header over Westwood moments after Nuhiu headed Liam Palmer's cross against the bar at the other end. Birmingham boss Gary Rowett: \\"The way we worked hard when we were not playing well certainly gave us the opportunity to do what we did late in the game. \\"The changes we made in terms of tactics gave us the chance to get back into the game. Against a team like Sheffield Wednesday you always have to ride out 15 to 20 minutes which I thought we did really well.\\" Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal: \\"I am very happy with our form.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Who were the three Great Powers fighting against?\\"  Context: \\"After years of negotiation, three Great Powers, Russia, the United Kingdom and France, decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra, the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at Navarino. After a week-long standoff, a battle began which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. A French expeditionary force was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese, while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the nascent Greek state was finally recognized under the London Protocol in 1830.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The three Great Powers, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, were fighting against the combined forces of the Ottoman Empire and Egypt during the Greek War of Independence. The conflict aimed at liberating Greece from the rule of the Ottoman Empire and establishing an independent Greek state. The Ottoman Empire had ruled over Greece for centuries, and by the early 19th century, a growing nationalist movement inspired by the Enlightenment and revolutionary ideas from the French and American revolutions led to a strong desire for Greek independence. In 1821, the Greek War of Independence began, with Greek revolutionaries fighting against the Ottoman control. As the war continued, the humanitarian crisis and atrocities committed by the Ottoman Empire against the Greek population caught the attention and sympathy of the nations of Europe. In particular, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, which were all significant powers at the time, became increasingly involved in the conflict. The three Great Powers saw an opportunity to both curtail the influence of the Ottoman Empire and champion the cause of national self-determination. In the case of Russia, it had long-standing religious and cultural ties with the Greek Orthodox Christians, and it sought to expand its influence in the region. The United Kingdom was interested in ensuring stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, safeguarding its trade routes, and preventing the spread of revolutionary ideas. France was motivated by its support for national sovereignty and the opportunity to weaken a rival empire, the Ottomans. Further, all three nations were concerned about maintaining the balance of power in Europe. Although they had divergent interests and motivations, these Great Powers eventually agreed to work together and intervene in the conflict after years of negotiation. Each nation sent a navy to Greece, and they managed to defeat the combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino in 1827. This decisive victory significantly weakened the Ottoman control in the region and paved the way for the eventual establishment of an independent Greek state. Following further negotiations and diplomacy, the nascent Greek state was recognized under the London Protocol in 1830, thus ending the Greek War of Independence and establishing Greece's sovereignty. The intervention of the three Great Powers, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, was instrumental in the eventual success of the Greek revolutionaries and the creation of the modern Greek state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Math Problem Solve -61*l + 52*l + 630 = -24*l for l.","output":"To solve the equation -61*l + 52*l + 630 = -24*l for the variable l, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. -61*l and 52*l are like terms because they have the same variable, l, with the same exponent 1. Similarly, -24*l on the other side of the equation is also a like term. Combine the like terms on the left side of the equation: -61*l + 52*l = -9*l Now the equation becomes: -9*l + 630 = -24*l Step 2: Move all the terms with the variable l to one side of the equation. Add 24*l to both sides of the equation to move the term with l to one side: -9*l + 24*l + 630 = -24*l + 24*l This simplifies the equation to: 15*l + 630 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable l. Subtract 630 from both sides of the equation to isolate l: 15*l + 630 - 630 = 0 - 630 This simplifies the equation to: 15*l = -630 Step 4: Solve for l. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 15 to solve for l: 15*l / 15 = -630 / 15 This simplifies to: l = -42 The solution to the equation -61*l + 52*l + 630 = -24*l for the variable l is l = -42."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants.  - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.  - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world.  - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area.  - Prorastomus sirenoides is an extinct species of primitive sirenian that lived during the Eocene Epoch 40 million years ago in Jamaica .  - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - Sirenia, commonly referred to as sea cows, is an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. Sirenia comprises the families Dugongidae (the dugong), Trichechidae (manatees), Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians), and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians). There are currently four extant species of sirenians. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.  - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay.

Please write a short summary for the following article: My Instagram: Kiana Gibson For Roslindale resident Kiana Gibson (@kiana29), taking pictures for Instagram is an absolutely crucial part of the week. “I have photography withdrawal if I don’t do it after a few days,” the 37-year-old pre-kindergarten associate teacher says, laughing. As one of three moderators for the popular IGers Boston account (@igersboston), Gibson works not just to populate her own feed with scenic snaps, but also to help find shots for the group and cultivate one of the photography-sharing app’s fastest-growing local communities. Q. How would you characterize your personal account? A. My personal profile is mostly street photography. My style is everyday life and the beauty of the city, through my lens. It’s all of architecture, people, and popular landmarks. Q. Do you go to specific areas or all over? A. I tend to walk in the well-known tourist areas, such as Beacon Hill, downtown, Boston Public Garden, and the Copley area. Q. What catches your eye, subject-wise? A. A lot of times, I’m inspired by the weather. When it’s rainy, that can make the bricks on the streets shiny, and I’ll go out and shoot someone with a cool umbrella. I find myself inspired by snow as well — I go out and shoot things that might look different, like the George Washington statue in the Boston Public Garden, which just looks so much cooler in the snow. And the littlest thing will catch my eye. Three or four weeks ago, I shot someone holding two red bags, one in each hand, and that caught my eye, so it can really be as simple as that. Q. What makes a good photo ? A. It’s the connection you can make with the photo. I might find a cool building downtown and take the photo of the building. Architecturally, it just looks really cool, and when I post it to Instagram, the people who follow me can make a connection with that place. They might say they walked past it when they visited Boston, or that they walk past it every day — and that they’re excited to see it. It’s not just about me — it’s also about the connections others can make with it. Q. Is there a recent photo you took that you’re particularly proud of? A. There’s a rooftop photo that I had taken from the Taj. The subject is the Prudential, and behind the Prudential is the sunset. It’s something you can’t particularly see from the ground, but from above, you can see the sunset starting to come in, and the color that it brings to the background of the city. I like that one a lot.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin.  and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  Please answer this question : Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin as compared to Robin. This is because the amount of melanin produced is determined by both heredity and exposure to UV light. Since Robin is exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, her melanocytes will be stimulated to produce more melanin. On the other hand, Samantha is not using any UV light and is only using lotion for her skin, so her exposure to UV light is significantly lower, leading to a lower melanin production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played Othello, but I've never witnessed a performance of the play, on film or on stage, wherein Othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity. According to the biographical notes, Fishburne never received any professional training as an actor. Perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. Instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles, Fishburne's portrayal is focused more on Othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. In a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by Fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been. The acting throughout is superb, and the (abridged) speeches gain grace from their light editing.

Context: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. Question: How old was the customer? Answer: Answer:","output":"The text does not provide specific information about the exact age of the customer.

Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle.","output":"The task is asking you to find the advantages of using water as a working fluid in a Rankine cycle based on the given context. The context provides information about the types of systems and the working fluids used in Rankine cycles. To find the answer, you need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the relevant information in the context passage which discusses the advantages of using water as a working fluid. 2. Extract and summarize the key points from the passage that highlights the advantages of water. Based on the context passage, the advantages of using water as a working fluid in a Rankine cycle include: - Non-toxic and unreactive chemistry: Water does not pose harm to the environment or any health risks. - Abundance: Water is widely available which makes it a practical choice. - Low cost: Water is relatively inexpensive, making it an economically favorable option. - Thermodynamic properties: Water has favorable thermodynamic properties for use in a Rankine cycle. Hence, the output (answer) would be: Water is advantageous as a working fluid due to its non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, low cost, and favorable thermodynamic properties."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instructions: In this task you will be given a string and you should find the longest substring that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards as it is forwards. If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Input: iiiifiiifi Output:","output":"To find the longest palindrome substring in the given string 'iiiifiiifi', we can follow these steps: Step 1: Initialize two variables maxLength and start to store the length of the longest palindrome substring and its starting index. Initialize them with 1 and 0 respectively, as a single character (the first character) will be the minimum-length palindrome. Step 2: Iterate through the string from index i=1 to i=len(string) - 1 to check for palindrome substrings with center at each character in the string.   That is, check the characters on both sides of the center and expand outwards. Step 3: Since palindrome substrings can have even or odd lengths, we should repeat the check for both possibilities at each center: 3.1: Check for even-length palindrome substring:   - Initialize left=i-1 and right=i.   - While left >= 0 and right < len(string) and string[left] == string[right]:       - Increment the substring length by 2.       - Decrement left by 1 and increment right by 1.   - If substring length is greater than maxLength, update maxLength and start. 3.2: Check for odd-length palindrome substring:   - Initialize left=i-1 and right=i+1.   - While left >= 0 and right < len(string) and string[left] == string[right]:       - Increment the substring length by 2.       - Decrement left by 1 and increment right by 1.   - If substring length is greater than maxLength, update maxLength and start. Step 4: After iterating through the entire string, use the maxLength and start variables to return the longest palindrome substring.

I do know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Other than that, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor. Good, with that point set, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and I am surprised he came up with this. It may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases, I am afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked- I mean, give the audience a break, and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd action. However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures. It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene. I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke. Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European. Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people, maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation. Maybe. Now, what is this review like? Select from the following.

Answer the following question: Question: what affects the money supply I found the following answer on Google: There are several ways to define \\"money,\\" but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions). Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. The money supply is usually measured by considering currency in circulation and demand deposits. However, I will expand on this topic to provide a more detailed answer. The money supply can be affected by various factors, which can be broadly categorized into three groups: 1. Actions by Central Banks: Central banks are responsible for managing the money supply in a country. They can influence the money supply through several tools, such as:    a. Open market operations: Central banks can buy or sell government bonds to affect the money supply. When a central bank purchases bonds, it increases the amount of money circulating in the economy. Conversely, selling bonds takes money out of the economy, decreasing the money supply.        b. Changing the reserve ratio: This refers to the percentage of reserves that commercial banks must hold against their deposit liabilities. By increasing the reserve ratio, central banks can reduce the amount of money available for lending, ultimately leading to a decrease in the money supply. Conversely, lowering the reserve ratio can increase the money supply.    c. Adjusting interest rates: Central banks can influence the money supply by altering short-term interest rates. Lowering interest rates can encourage borrowing and spending, which can lead to an increase in the money supply. Conversely, raising interest rates can discourage borrowing and spending, and, as a result, decrease the money supply. 2. Banking Activities: Commercial banks also play a significant role in affecting the money supply.    a. Fractional reserve banking: Commercial banks are only required to hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves, and they can lend out the remainder. This process of creating money through lending can either increase or decrease the money supply, depending on the demand for loans.    b. Deposit creation: When customers deposit money in their accounts, banks can lend this money to other customers. The deposited funds become part of the money supply as new loans are extended, thus increasing the money supply. 3. Economic Factors: Various economic factors can also influence the money supply.    a. Economic growth: As an economy grows, businesses may need more funds to expand, and consumers may be more willing to spend. This can lead to an increase in borrowing, which ultimately increases the money supply.    b. Inflation: Inflation can affect the money supply as central banks may respond to higher inflation by tightening monetary policy (e.g., raising interest rates), which can reduce the money supply. Conversely, in times of low inflation or deflation, central banks may loosen monetary policy (e.g., lowering interest rates), which can increase the money supply. In summary, the money supply is influenced by a combination of central bank policies, commercial banking activities, and prevailing economic conditions. Currency in circulation and demand deposits are important components of the money supply, and various factors can affect their levels."},{"instruction":"Facts:   - position: goal keeper    - currentclub: flambeau de l’est      - birth date: 27 july 1995    - name: arakaza macarthur   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of arakaza macarthur .

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the song where there is a chorus of women's voices wordlessly by the composer who was inspired by Walt Whitman?  Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\".

Stimulation of cell surface receptors with growth factors and chemoattractants generates ROS, which relay signals from the cell surface to key signaling proteins inside the cell. ROS act within cells to promote migration and also in nonmigrating cells to influence the behavior of migrating cells. Hydrogen peroxide has also been suggested to act as a chemoattractant in its own right, drawing immune cells to wounds.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: before starting to write. While thinking about what to write, put down any idea that comes to you, even if it seems far-fetched or unlikely to be successful. One mediocre idea may lead to a better one. Find a topic that grabs your attention and thrills you. Your excitement and interest will make it easier for you to keep the project going and keep it to a high standard, and hopefully it will rub off on the reader as well. A serious writing project doesn't need to be a full-length book. Crafting a short story can be a difficult and rewarding challenge, and may be a more time-effective way to practice your skills. Keep a notebook for writing down observations, overheard conversations, and sudden ideas encountered in your daily life. When you read or hear something that makes you laugh, think, or want to repeat it to someone else, write it down and think about what makes it effective.  You may prefer to keep your ideas in a digital file, such as a Word document or Google Doc. This makes it easier to develop your ideas or insert them into other documents. If you use Google Docs, you can also access your work from several devices. You may use this notebook or file to collect unfamiliar words as well. Use whatever technique works best for you, or try out several if you don't have an established process yet. You can make an outline, put a collection of notes on cards and arrange them until they are in order, or draw a tree or map. Your outline may have nothing but a rough order of the events or topics covered, or it may be a more detailed scene-by-scene summary. Building some kind of structure in advance can help keep you going on days when you're feeling low on creativity.  There are many types of organizational software for writers, such as Scrivener or TheSage. You could also use a simple Word document or Google Docs. With Google Docs, you can access your writing from any device. It's fine to deviate from your plan, but if you abandon it entirely, stop and consider the reasons behind the chance. Build a new plan to guide you through the altered work, and keep you thinking consciously about how you want to get through it. While a work of nonfiction requires you to know your subject, even a fiction book will benefit from research. If your main character is a glassblower, read a book on glassblowing and use the right terminology. If you are writing a book set before you were born, interview people who lived during that time, or who spoke to parents and grandparents who did. In the case of fiction writing, you may be able to dive in to the first draft before you start your research. Try writing without pause for as long as you can. Do not stop to change your word choice or correct your grammar, spelling, or punctuation. This is one of the most common recommendations for making sure that you actually finish what you start. Once you have a first draft, reread it and rewrite it. You are looking for errors in grammar and spelling as well as style, content, organization, and coherence. If there are any passages you dislike, get rid of them and write them again from scratch. Critiquing your own work is an important skill, and it takes plenty of practice, just like writing itself.. Give yourself time between writing and editing, if at all possible.  It is better to wait a good length of time, but even a short break can give you some of the necessary distance and detachment to edit well. Get feedback on your work in progress from interested readers, whether they are friends, fellow writers, or readers of your writing blog. Try to accept criticism without getting angry or upset; even if you don't agree with the specifics, knowing what parts of your work people dislike can be valuable for focusing your editing. Don't be afraid to make drastic changes, even cutting whole sections of the project or rewriting it from a different character's perspective. Continue the cycle of feedback and editing as you explore how to perfect your work. If it feels like running in place, remember you are practicing skills that will help you in all your future writing. You can always take a break to write something fun and ridiculous, just to remind yourself that writing can be a blast. Summary:","output":"When starting a writing project, jot down all your ideas, even those that initially seem mediocre or implausible, as they can lead to better ideas. Choose a topic that excites and interests you to maintain your project's momentum and quality. Writing projects do not need to be full-length books; short stories can also provide a worthwhile challenge. Keep a notebook or digital file for recording observations, conversations, sudden ideas, and unfamiliar words encountered in daily life. Utilize organizational tools like an outline, note cards, or software like Scrivener, but be ready to adjust your plan as needed. In both nonfiction and fiction writing, research is valuable for authenticity. Write first drafts quickly without worrying about corrections; editing comes later. Taking breaks between writing and editing can improve your ability to spot errors. Getting feedback from others is crucial for refining your work accordingly, and don't be afraid to make drastic changes if needed. See the entire process as a chance to develop your writing skills, and remember to have fun with it too."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, his world is suddenly destabilised by a series of unexplained murders (including Harold's best friend, Colin) and exploding bombs from an unknown foe. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs. The situation worsens when a pub in which they are about to have dinner at is blown up and Harold's partner, Victoria, tells the Americans that they are under attack from an unknown enemy. She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London.

Question 1 is asking about the best biking riding gears suitable for all terrain in India, while question 2 is asking if the person can learn to ride gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200. Here are detailed answers to both questions: Question 1: What are the best biking riding gears for all terrain in India? To tackle various terrains in India, a rider requires appropriate gear and protection. The best biking riding gears for all terrains in India would include the following: 1. Helmet: A good quality helmet is essential for any rider. Look for a helmet that meets safety standards, fits well, has proper ventilation, and provides a clear visor. 2. Riding Jacket: A riding jacket should be made of high-quality abrasion-resistant material, such as Cordura, leather or mesh, and it should have proper ventilation for hot weather conditions. The jacket should have CE-certified armor for added protection in the shoulders, elbows, and back. 3. Riding Pants: Like a riding jacket, riding pants should also be made of abrasion-resistant material with CE-certified armor in the hip and knee areas. Pants should offer a comfortable fit and have proper ventilation. 4. Riding Gloves: Good-quality gloves are essential for protecting your hands. They should have a snug fit, be made of abrasion-resistant material, and have reinforced palms, knuckle protection, and ideally, touchscreen compatibility. 5. Riding Boots: For all terrains, invest in high-quality riding boots that offer excellent protection for your feet, ankles, and lower legs. They should be made of abrasion-resistant material and should have sturdy soles for better grip on varied surfaces. 6. Knee and Elbow Guards: Additional knee and elbow guards can provide extra protection in case of falls or accidents. 7. Body Armor: A body armor vest can provide extra protection for the chest and back in case of an accident. 8. Neck Brace: A neck brace can help to prevent neck injuries during a crash. 9. Rain Gear: Waterproof jackets, pants, and gloves are essential for riding in the unpredictable Indian monsoon season. Question 2: Can I learn riding gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200? Yes, you can learn to ride gear bikes on a KTM Duke 200. However, it is essential to keep the following points in mind: 1. KTM Duke 200 is a performance-oriented motorcycle with a powerful engine, and it may not be the best option for a beginner learning to ride a gear bike. Consider starting with a less powerful, more beginner-friendly bike like a 100-125 cc commuter bike. 2. If you have prior experience riding geared scooters or similar vehicles, you may find it easier to learn on the KTM Duke 200. Make sure you are familiar with the motorcycle's controls and handling before starting. 3. Take a professional training course or find a knowledgeable mentor to help you learn to ride the KTM Duke 200 properly. Proper guidance can make a significant difference in your learning experience. 4. Practice in a safe and controlled environment, such as an empty parking lot or closed roads, before taking the bike onto public roads. It is essential to gain confidence and experience before navigating traffic and difficult road conditions. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. The first question is about the best biking riding gears for all terrains in India, while the second question is about learning to ride geared bikes on a KTM Duke 200."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unlike the famous cartoon sailor, who gets his strength from the iron-rich plant, 'Big Mo' cannot stand the greenery. The 24-year-old Egyptian, whose 31-inch biceps measure the same as a man's waist, says spinach is to him what kryptonite is to Superman. Scroll down for video. Record-breaker: Unlike the cartoon sailor, 'the real-life Popeye' Moustafa Ismail is actually allergic to spinach. Weakness: The muscleman said the iron-rich plant is to him what kryptonite is to Superman. International recognition: Big Mo's incredible physique has earned him dozens of trips around the world. Mr Ismail, who entered the Guinness World Book of Records last year as the man with the world's largest biceps, added: 'I like chicken and beef - anything but spinach.' The bodybuilder is the toast of his hometown Alexandria, which he left to move to America in 2007 to find better gym equipment. He said he was fat as a child growing up in the Middle East but had returned home as 'the Hulk'. Mr Ismail, who lives with his wife Carolina, 30, in the U.S., said: 'I'm the first Egyptian in the Guinness book. In Egypt they had a celebration for me and my family - they were so proud.' Muscleman: Mr Ismail is in the Guinness World Book of Records as the man with the world's largest biceps.

'Disgraceful': Little Chloe Elliott's grave, pictured left, was vandalised on Wednesday night. 'It's immoral and shows a complete lack of respect for other people,' said Andy Jean, whose mother Marie Jean's grave was severely damaged in the attack.

Question: Bill and Bob were two brothers. they were both into physical exercise, but Bill chose weight lifting, and Bob running.  Which brother had smaller muscles?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"Bob had smaller muscles because he chose running, which focuses more on increasing the strength and efficiency of the cardiac muscle rather than increasing the size and strength of skeletal muscles like weight lifting does."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on miguel rojas 's:    - clubs     - caps     - position     - nationalcaps     - currentclub     - height     - years     - nationalyears     - nationalgoals       - pcupdate     - birth date     - fullname     - name     - nationalteam     - birth place     - goals     Bio: miguel rojas -lrb- born 5 march 1977 -rrb- is a colombian international footballer who plays as a right back .

Because he was so heavy, his ankles hurt a lot, just like how your legs might feel tired after running around all day. Matt worked in a magical place called a Chinese takeaway, where chefs create delicious foods like noodles, rice, and sweet and sour chicken. But Matt noticed something interesting at work. You know how your mom or dad might cook you a yummy dinner, but they eat something different that's maybe a little healthier? The chefs at the Chinese takeaway were doing that too. They were cooking food for themselves that didn't have as much fat or oil as the food they made to sell. Matt thought, \\"Hey, I could do that too!\\" So he decided to kiss goodbye to the food from the takeaway and start cooking his own food, just like the chefs. He swapped the fatty food for dishes that had less fat, just like choosing a juicy apple over a candy bar. And guess what? It worked! Matt began to lose weight, just like letting air out of a balloon. His hard work and decision to eat healthier food made him slim down to the size of 14 bags of sugar. That's as if he left behind 6 bags of sugar! So, remember kiddos: just like Matt, choosing healthier food options can make us feel much better and keep us from getting tired or hurting.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City. He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna (nicknamed \\"Bamie\\"), a younger brother, Elliott, and a younger sister, Corinne. Elliott was later the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; his other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore Sr. was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \\"C.V.S.\\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill. Theodore's fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler family.  Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the \\"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for display. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled \\"The Natural History of Insects\\".  Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included Confederate leaders. Roosevelt said, \\"My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.","output":"This text is about Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the 26th President of the United States who served from 1901 to 1909.

In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on...

The author seems to be expressing their emotions regarding the conclusion of the school year and the subsequent arrival of the summer season. The excitement can be primarily attributed to the use of capitalization and expressions like \\"OMG\\" (Oh My God), which denote an energetic and highly charged emotional state. Furthermore, phrases like “SUMMER IZ ON” convey the author's enthusiasm for the upcoming summer months, which is often associated with relaxation, leisure, and a break from academic responsibilities. However, the tweet also conveys a sense of nostalgia and sadness. The author states that \\"IT DIDNT HIT ME YET,\\" suggesting that they haven't fully processed the implications of the school year coming to an end. The transition from school to summer break can involve significant changes in daily routines, experiences, and social interactions. This, in turn, can evoke feelings of nostalgia as individuals reflect on memories and milestones achieved during the past school year. Additionally, the mention of being \\"SAD\\" displays a sense of longing, where the user may be expressing apprehension or lamenting the parting from their classmates, teachers, or structured learning environment. School often provides a sense of consistency and stability, and coming to the end of the academic year can invoke feelings of insecurity or a tinge of sorrow.

First, simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable t: (-15*t + 32*t + 0*t) = -15t + 32t + 0t = (32 - 15)t = 17t So, the simplified equation is 17t = -51 2. Now, to find the value of t, divide both sides of the equation by 17: 17t = -51  Divide by 17: t = -51 / 17 3.

In response, MI6 agent James Bond (007) is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming.Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport. He is picked up by a chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette.During his investigation Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be un-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognises Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter. The CIA has traced the mysterious radio jamming of American rockets to the Jamaica vicinity, but aerial photography cannot see the exact location of its origin. Quarrel reveals that he has been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples.

A:","output":"In the movie Dr. No, James Bond (007) escapes the holding cell through his resourcefulness and quick thinking. After being captured by Dr. No's men and imprisoned in a cell, Bond studies the environment and notices that the air vents above his cell are large enough for him to crawl through. Knowing that it's his best chance to escape, he uses his ingenuity to devise a plan. Bond removes one of his shoes and detaches its heel, which is equipped with a small gadget - a makeshift lock pick. He then uses the lock pick to open the vent grate. Once the vent is open, Bond takes off his other shoe and climbs up into the vent, crawling through the ducts until he finds his way to a different part of the facility. After escaping from the air duct, Bond overhears a conversation regarding the self-destruction of the facility. He comes across a room where he finds a radiation suit. He puts it on, blends in with the staff, and sabotages the nuclear reactor's control, which ultimately leads to the destruction of Dr. No's lair. Bond continues to fight against Dr. No's henchmen and ultimately confronts Dr. No himself.

Her maiden voyage took place on May 27, 1936, sailing from Southampton, England, to New York City, USA. However, the ocean liner first gained the Blue Riband title in August 1936. To provide some context, the Blue Riband is an unofficial and prestigious honor that has been given to the fastest passenger ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean since the 19th century. It recognizes the vessel for achieving the highest average speed on a westbound or eastbound route, often referring to the \\"westbound record\\" as the most challenging one due to unfavorable weather conditions and currents. The Queen Mary managed to capture the Blue Riband on August 30, 1936, while sailing on an eastbound route from New York to Southampton. During this crossing, the ocean liner achieved an average speed of 30.14 knots (about 34.68 miles per hour or 55.8 kilometers per hour), covering the distance in approximately 3 days, 23 hours, and 57 minutes. The Queen Mary proudly held the title until 1937, when her sister ship, the RMS Queen Elizabeth, bested her record. However, the Queen Mary regained the Blue Riband in 1938 by setting a new westbound record with an average speed of 31.69 knots (about 36.48 miles per hour or 58.7 kilometers per hour). The Queen Mary continued to be a symbol of British supremacy at sea, setting various records for speed and luxury throughout her service years.

Write some highlights for the following article: MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- The Somali government has asked Russia to intervene against pirates who have seized a Ukrainian cargo ship, the Somali ambassador to Russia said Wednesday. The U.S. Navy released this observance  photo of the MV Faina, which is loaded with weapons and tanks. But the Russian navy issued a statement later in the day saying it had no intention of using force against the pirates, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. \\"The questions of freeing the ships and crew are being dealt with in line with the corresponding international practices,\\" Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo as saying. \\"For understandable reasons, the use of force would be an extreme measure because it could threaten the life of the international crew of the ship.\\" The pirates took over the MV Faina last week off the coast of Somalia and are demanding a 20 million ransom for the ship's cargo of 33 Soviet-made T-72 tanks, tank artillery shells, grenade launchers and small arms. The ship is anchored within Somalia's 12-mile territorial limit. \\"The government and the president of Somalia are allowing the Russian naval ships to enter our waters, and fight against pirates both in the sea and on the land, that is, if they would have to chase them,\\" Amb. Mohamed Handule said at a news conference in Moscow. \\"We think that this issue of piracy has exceeded all limits. It is very dangerous that pirates are now laying their hands on arms -- not just for Somalia, not only for the navigating, but for the entire region in general,\\" he added. \\"Right now, pirates are controlling the sea in this area, but just imagine if they get control of the land too.\\" The announcement raised concern among some officials monitoring the situation.  Watch Russian warships move to confront pirates ». \\"We may have bad news,\\" said Andrew Mwangura of the Kenya Seafarers Association. Mwangura said some of the Ukrainian crew's family members are concerned for their loved ones' safety and have called him to see if he can communicate with the pirates. He urged negotiations to continue. \\"For the safety of the crew members,\\" Mwangura said, \\"let the ship owners talk with the pirates.\\"  Watch Mwangura talk about the rise in pirating ». A Russian navy ship sailing toward the Faina is in the Atlantic Ocean and \\"still has a bit of water to get here,\\" said U.S. Navy Lt. Stephanie Murdock, who is stationed in nearby Bahrain. \\"There is no estimated time of arrival yet.\\" The U.S. Navy has several ships in the area monitoring the situation. \\"There have been no changes today,\\" Murdock said. The Navy has not communicated with the Russian ship but will work out coordination when it arrives, Murdock said. The Russian ship Neustrashimy is headed to the region solely to protect Russian shipping, according to the Russian navy spokesman. \\"The navy command has been stressing that the Neustrashimy, from the Baltic Sea Fleet, has been given the task of arriving in the area of Somalia and guaranteeing for a certain time the safe seafaring of Russian ships in the area with a high risk of pirate attacks. The essence of the mission is to prevent the seizure of Russian ships by pirates,\\" Dygalo said. Handule, the Nigerian ambassador, seemed to criticize the United States for not taking action. \\"Ships of more than 10 countries are now close to our shores, but we are not satisfied with the results of their activities,\\" he said. Citing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1816, Handule said, \\"We are inviting all countries, all states who have possibility to support Somalia to fight against ... pirates. We are especially inviting Russia and giving special status to Russian warships to fight, to help Somalia.\\" The latest developments came two days after three pirates were killed when they started shooting at each other, according to Mwangura, the Kenya maritime official. The shootout centered on a disagreement between moderate and radical pirates aboard the ship, Mwangura said. The moderates wanted to surrender, but the radicals did not. The pirates hijacked the ship off the coast of Somalia September 25. The Faina had been headed to the Kenyan port of Mombasa after departing from Nikolayev, Ukraine, and was seized not far from its destination. The Faina is owned and operated by Kaalbye Shipping Ukraine, and its crew includes citizens of Ukraine, Russia and Latvia, the Navy said. Abdi Salan Khalif, commissioner of the coastal town of Harardhere, told CNN the pirates told a group of town elders that one crew member had died of high blood pressure problems. Attacks by pirates have increased dramatically in the waters off Somalia's northern coast in the past year, prompting the U.S. and other coalition warships to widen their patrols in the region. Three ships were hijacked on August 21 in that area, the \\"worst number of attacks\\" in a single day in many years, Capt. Pottengal Mukudan of the International Maritime Bureau told CNN. After the spate of attacks, the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain announced that it would begin patrolling a newly established shipping corridor in the Gulf of Aden in an attempt to protect international shipping. Canada also sent a warship through the end of September. The International Maritime Bureau said in April that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008, compared with 41 for the same period last year. It recorded 263 pirates attacks last year, up from 239 the year before and the first increase in three years. Highlights:","output":"1.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Just as this government has a long term plan for where we are taking our country so within that we have a long-term plan for immigration. Immigration benefits Britain, but it needs to be controlled. It needs to be fair. And it needs to be centred around our national interest. That is what I want. And let me tell you why I care so passionately about getting this right - and getting the whole debate on immigration right in our country. When I think about what makes me proud to be British yes, it is our history, our values, our creativity, our compassion but there is something else too. I am extremely proud that together we have built a successful, multi-racial democracy. A country where in one or two generations people can come with nothing and rise as high as their talent allows. A country whose success has been founded not on building separate futures, but rather coming together to build a common home. We have always been an open nation, welcoming those who want to make a contribution and build a decent life for themselves and their families. From the Jewish communities who came to Britain before World War One to the West Indians who docked at Tilbury on the Windrush and helped to rebuild our country after World War Two. Even at times of war and danger, when our island status has protected us, we have offered sanctuary to those fleeing tyranny and persecution. We will never forget the Polish and Czech pilots who helped save this country in its hour of need and the Poles who went on to settle here, help build post war Britain and indeed contribute so much to our country today. And we are proud of the role we played in providing a haven to the Ugandan Asians in the early 1970s who now count among their number four Members of the House of Lords, some of the UK's most successful businessmen, a BBC News presenter and the owner of a company providing china to the royal households. Our openness is part of who we are. We should celebrate it. We should never allow anyone to demonise it. And we must never give in to those who would throw away our values, with the appalling prospect of repatriating migrants who are here totally legally and have lived here for years. We are Great Britain because of immigration, not in spite of it. So it is fundamental to the future of our country that we get this issue right. And in doing so, there are three dangerous views which we need to confront. First, is the complacent view that says the levels of immigration we've seen in the past decade aren't really a problem at all. That mass migration is an unavoidable by-product of a new world order of globalisation. That globalisation is an unalloyed good - and those complaining about immigration just need to get with the modern world. Often the people who have these views are those who have no direct experience of the impact of high levels of migration. They have never waited on a social housing list or found that their child's classroom is overcrowded or felt that their community has changed too fast. And what makes everyone else really angry is that if they dare to express these concerns they can be made to feel guilty about doing so. We should be clear. It is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country. People have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: control. People want Government to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come, both from around the world and from within the European Union. They want control over who has the right to receive benefits and what is expected of them in return. They want to know that foreign criminals can be excluded - or if already here, removed. And they want us to manage carefully the pressures on our schools, our hospitals and our housing. If we are to maintain this successful open meritocratic democracy we treasure, we have to maintain faith in government's ability to control the rate at which people come to this country. And yet in recent years, it has become clear that successive Governments have lacked control. People want grip. I get that. And I completely agree. To respond to this with complacency is both wrong and dangerous. The second dangerous view is to think we can somehow pull up the drawbridge and retreat from the world, shutting off immigration altogether. People who make this argument try to dress it up as speaking up for our country. But this isolationism is actually deeply unpatriotic. Yes, Britain is an island nation. But we have never been an insular one. Throughout our long history, we have always looked outward, not inward. We have used the seas that surround our shores not to cut ourselves off from the world, but to reach out to it - to carry our trade to the four corners of the earth. And with that trade has come people, companies, jobs and investment. We have always understood that our national greatness is built on our openness. We see that every day. In our National Health Service, which would grind to a halt without the hundreds of thousands who have come from overseas to help run it. In the City of London, the financial epicentre of the world, where so many, from so many different countries, have come to make Britain their home. In the Bank of England, where the best Central Banker in the world, a Canadian, is our Governor. In our world class universities, where students and indeed professors have come from all over the world. This is modern Britain. A country that has come out of recession to become the fastest growing advanced economy in the world. That has happened in part because we are an open nation. And for the sake of British jobs, British livelihoods and British opportunities we must fight this dangerous and misguided view that our nation can withdraw from the world and somehow all will be well. The third view we need to confront is the idea that a successful plan to control immigration is only about immigration policy and controls. A modern immigration plan is not just about the decisions you take on the people you allow into your country. It is also about the education you provide to your own people and the rights and responsibilities at the heart of your welfare system. Because the problem hasn't just been a simplistic one of too many people coming here it's also been too many British people untrained and too many British people without the incentive to work because they can get a better income living on benefits. Even at the end of the so-called boom years, there were around five-million people in our country of working age but on out-of-work benefits. And this was at the same time as the last government enabled the largest wave of migration in our country's history. I want young British people schooled enough, skilled enough, keen enough to work so there is less demand for foreign workers. Put simply, our job is to educate and train up our youth, so we are less reliant on immigration to fill our skills gaps. And any politician who doesn't have a serious plan for welfare and education, has no sensible long-term plan for controlling immigration. In taking on these three views we also need to choose our language carefully. We must anchor the debate in fact not prejudice. We must have no truck with those who use immigration to foment division, or as a surrogate for other agendas. We should distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions. There are no simple solutions. Managing immigration is hard. Not only here. But in every major developed economy. Certainly in Europe. Look at Italy, where migration from North Africa is a vital issue. Look at Germany, where benefit tourism is a huge concern. Or look at the United States, the ultimate melting pot, where President Obama has just announced sweeping reforms. Look at Australia, whose points-based system we now operate in Britain, where the issue of immigration dominated their last election campaign and where migrant numbers are actually higher, pro rata, than in the UK. The British people understand this. They know that a modern, knowledge-based economy like ours needs immigration. There is a parallel here. On the EU, most British people don't want a false choice between the status quo or leaving. They want reform and a referendum. On immigration, they don't want limitless immigration and they don't want no immigration. They want controlled immigration. And they are right. So what are the facts? Over the last ten years, immigration to the UK has soared, while the number of Britons going to work abroad has remained roughly the same. As a result, net immigration - a reasonably good way of measuring the pressure of immigration - has gone up significantly. To give you some idea of the scale. In terms of the net figures. In the thirty years leading up to 2004, net migration in the UK was around one million. In just the next seven years, it was 1.5 million. The gross figures are that 8.3 million people came to the UK as long-term migrants in the thirty years leading up to 2004. And a further 4 million came in the next seven years. What caused this increase? Certainly, a lax approach to immigration by the last Government, which they themselves have since admitted. For example, their points system included an entire category for people outside the EU with no skills to come to the UK. It was too easy for foreign nationals to become citizens. There was a huge increase in asylum claims. There were disproportionate numbers of jobs going to foreign workers. The welfare system allowed new EU migrant workers to claim immediately, without having paid in, which is in contrast to many other countries. And, of course, there was the decision by the last Government not to impose transitional controls on the eight new countries which entered the EU in 2004. With their economies considerably poorer than ours - and with almost every other EU country opting to keep controls - it made the UK a uniquely attractive destination for the citizens of those countries. One million people came to Britain after that decision. When we came to office in 2010, we were determined to get to grips with this problem. So we set a clear target: to return net migration to 1990s levels when even though we had an open economy, proper immigration controls meant immigration was in the tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands. And we set to work on it immediately, with a clear plan to tackle non-EU migration in a targeted way while continuing to permit companies to bring in the skilled workers they needed and allowing universities to attract the best talent from around the world. So we took action to cut numbers and tackle abuse on every visa route for those coming to Britain from outside Europe. We imposed an annual cap on economic migration of 20,700. We clamped down on bogus students and stopped nearly 800 fake colleges bringing people in. We insisted that those wishing to have family come and join them must earn at least £18,600 per year and pass an English language test. In addition, we have made Britain a much harder place to exist as an illegal immigrant. This is all relentless, painstaking work. I have been out on the ground with Border Force staff. I have talked with the immigration officers who used to have no choice but to admit what they felt sure were fake students, claiming to come here to study without being able to speak a word of English. We have tightened up across the board: not only at the border, but inside the country too by stopping illegal immigrants from opening a bank account, obtaining a driving licence, and renting a home. These are measures that other parties did not support but which I believe are essential and need to be carried forward further. We have also brought back vital exit checks at ports and airports. And by April, those checks will be in force at all our major ports and airports. So we will be able not only to count people in, but to count them out again. And in Calais we have created a £12 million fund to strengthen security, and we are working more closely than ever with our French partners to tackle illegal immigration and track down people smugglers. This determined effort is making a real difference. Even after yesterday's disappointing figures, net migration from outside Europe is down by almost a quarter, and falling close to the levels seen in the late 1990s. Without our reforms, in the last year alone, 50,000 more migrants from outside the EU would have come to the UK. But if I am Prime Minister after the election, we will go further. We will revoke licences from colleges and businesses which fail to do enough to prevent large numbers of migrants they sponsor from overstaying their visas. We will extend our new policy of 'deport first, appeal later' to cover all immigration appeals where a so-called right to family life is invoked. We will rapidly implement the requirement, included in our 2014 Immigration Act, for landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants. We will do all of these things. And we will continue with our welfare and education reforms making sure that it always pays to work training more British workers right across the country, but especially in local areas that are heavily reliant on migrant labour and supporting those communities with a new fund to help meet the additional demands on local services. We will also introduce stronger powers to tackle criminal gangs who bring people into this country and then withhold their passports and their pay. And I am proud that today we are publishing our Modern Slavery Strategy, clamping down on those appalling criminals who try and traffic people here. But our action to cut migration from outside the EU has not been enough to meet our target of cutting the overall numbers to the tens of thousands. The figures yesterday demonstrate that again. As we have reduced the numbers coming to the UK from outside the EU, the numbers from inside the EU have risen. In other words, our squeeze in one area has been offset by a bulge in another. The ambition remains the right one. But it's clear: it's going to take more time, more work and more difficult long term decisions to get there. Some people disagree with the whole concept of a net migration target, because they say you can be blown off course by the numbers emigrating each year. But there are two reasons why I think it's worthwhile. It measures the overall impact of migration in our country. And emigration figures from Britain are relatively constant. But I accept the logic of the argument about emigration. So as well as sticking to our ambition, we will set out additional metrics in the future so that people can clearly chart progress on the scale of migration from outside the EU - and from within it. So let me set out why net migration from the EU is rising and what we are going to do about it. The first thing to say is that it is a tribute to Britain that so many people want to come here. That has not always been the case. In the 1970s, when Britain was the sick man of Europe, more people were leaving Britain than coming here. Today, they are coming for perfectly understandable reasons. We are currently the jobs factory for Europe. Our unemployment is tumbling, and is now about half the level of France and a quarter the level of Spain. And whereas in the past the majority of the growth in employment was taken up by foreign nationals last year two thirds of that growth benefited British workers. While some Eurozone economies remain weak, our economy is now growing faster than every major economy in Europe and is the fastest growing economy in the G7. That fact - combined with our generous welfare system, including for those in work - makes the UK a magnetic destination for workers from other European countries. And let me be clear: the great majority of those who come here from Europe come to work, work hard and pay their taxes. They contribute to our country. They are willing to travel across the continent in search of a better life for them and their families. Many of them come just for a short period - a year or two - before returning home. And once economic growth returns to the countries of the Eurozone, and those economies start to grow and prosper, the economic pendulum will start to swing back. That will require far-reaching structural reform and removing barriers to job creation. And I welcome the intention of the new Commission to tackle these issues: they will have the whole-hearted support of the UK in doing so. So what, my European counterparts say to me, is the issue? They say: you have unemployment falling and your economy growing: this does not look to us like a serious problem. Indeed, many say they 'wish we had the sort of problems you have'. And some in Europe just think our problems are because our welfare system is a soft touch. But this Government has already taken unprecedented action to make our welfare system fairer and less open to abuse, all within the current rules. And these reforms, including restricting EU jobseeker entitlements, will save our taxpayers half a billion pounds over the next five years. But even with these changes, the pressure is still very great. In some areas, the number of migrants we are seeing is far higher than our local authorities, our schools and our hospitals can cope with. They are much higher than anything the EU has known before in its history. And they are far higher than what the founding fathers envisaged when the European Economic Community was established in 1957 or what Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl envisaged when they signed the Single European Act in 1986. One million people coming to one Member State is a vast migration, on a scale that has not happened before in peacetime. And yesterday's figures show that the scale of migration is still very great. So many people, so fast, is placing real burdens on our public services. There are secondary schools where the turnover of pupils can be as high as one third of the entire school in a year. There are primary schools where dozens of languages are spoken with only a small minority speaking English as their first language. There are hospitals where maternity units are under great pressure because birth rates have increased dramatically. There are Accident and Emergency departments under serious pressure. And there is pressure on social housing that cannot be met. And in a country with a generous, non-contributory welfare system, all this is raising real issues of fairness. People cannot understand how those who have not paid in can immediately take out. And they find it incomprehensible that a family coming from another EU country can claim child benefit from the UK - at UK rates - and send it back to children still living in their home country. When trust in the EU is already so low, we cannot afford to leave injustices like this to fester. Some of our partners will say: 'But you are not unique'. Germany, for instance, has had more EU migrants than the UK. But Germany is in a different situation. Germany's population is falling, and Britain's is rising. Now dealing with this issue in the EU is not straightforward, because of the freedom of movement to which all EU Member States sign up. I want to be clear: Britain supports the principle of the free movement of workers. We benefit from it, and 1.3 million British citizens exercise their right to go and live and work, and in many cases retire, in other European countries. Accepting the principle of free movement of workers is a key to being part of the single market. A market from which Britain has benefited enormously. So we do not want to destroy that principle or turn it on its head. Those who argue that Norway or Switzerland offer a better model for Britain ignore one crucial fact: they have each had to sign up to the principle of freedom of movement in order to access the single market and both countries actually have far higher per capita immigration than the UK. But freedom of movement has never been an unqualified right, and we now need to allow it to operate on a more sustainable basis in the light of the experience of recent years. That does not mean a closed door regime or a fundamental assault on the principle of free movement. What it does mean is finding arrangements to allow a Member State like the UK to restore a sense of fairness and bring down the current spike in numbers. My objective is simple: to make our immigration system fairer and reduce the current exceptionally high level of migration from within the EU into the UK. I am completely committed to delivering that - and I am ready to discuss with our partners any methods which achieve it, while maintaining the overall principle to which they, and we, attach importance. So let me set out the action we intend to take to cut migration from within Europe by dealing with abuse restricting the ability of migrants to stay here without a job and reducing the incentives for lower paid, lower skilled workers to come here in the first place. First, we want to create the toughest system in the EU for dealing with abuse of free movement. This includes stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back. And tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement including beggars, rough sleepers, fraudsters and people who collude in sham marriages. We must also deal with the extraordinary situation where it's easier for an EU citizen to bring a non-EU spouse to Britain, than it is for a British citizen to do the same. At the moment, if a British citizen wants to bring, say, a South American partner to the UK, then we ask for proof that they meet an income threshold and can speak English. But EU law means we cannot apply these tests to EU migrants. Their partners can just come straight into our country without any proper controls at all. And this has driven a growing industry in sham marriages, with this loophole accounting for most of the 4,000 bogus marriages that are thought to take place in Britain every year. We have got to end this abuse. Second, we want EU jobseekers to have a job offer before they come here and to stop UK taxpayers having to support them if they don't. This government inherited an indefensible system where the State - our taxpayers - paid EU jobseekers to look for work indefinitely and even paid their rent while they did so. In total that meant the British taxpayer was supporting a typical EU jobseeker with £600 a month. We have already begun to change this. We've scrapped housing benefit for EU jobseekers. And we have limited benefits claims to three months for those EU migrants who have no prospect of a job. But now we are going to go further. We are overhauling our welfare system with a new benefit called Universal Credit. This will replace existing benefits such as Jobseekers' Allowance that support people out of work. And its legal status means we can regain control over who we pay it to. So as Universal Credit is introduced we will pass a new law that means EU jobseekers will not be able to claim it. And we will do this within existing EU law. So instead of £600, they will get nothing. We also want to restrict the time that jobseekers can legally stay in this country. So if an EU jobseeker has not found work within six months, they will be required to leave. Let's be clear what this will mean. At the moment 40 per cent of those coming to work in the UK do not have a job offer when they arrive - the highest proportion in the EU. Many of these will no longer come. EU jobseekers who don't pay in will no longer get anything out. And those who do come will no longer be able to stay if they can't find work. There was a time when freedom of movement meant Member States could expect workers to have a job offer before they arrived and this will return us closer to that position. Third, we want to reduce the number of EU workers coming to the UK. Of course, that means never repeating the mistake that was made in 2004. So we will insist that when new countries are admitted to the EU in the future, free movement will not apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing Member States. Future accession treaties require unanimous agreement of all Member States. So the UK will ensure this change is included. But we also need to do more now to reduce migration from current Member States. And that means reducing the incentives for lower paid, low skilled EU workers to come here in the first place. Our welfare system is unusual in Europe. It pays out before you pay into it. That gives us particular difficulties, especially in respect of benefits while you are working - so called 'in work benefits'. Someone coming to the UK from elsewhere in the EU, who is employed on the minimum wage and who has two children back in their home country, will receive around £700 per month in benefits in the UK. This is more than twice what they would receive in Germany. And three times more than in France. No wonder so many people want to come to Britain. These tax credits and other welfare payments are a big financial incentive, and we know that over 400,000 EU migrants take advantage of them. This has got to change. So I will insist that in the future those who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contribute to our country for a minimum of four years. If their child is living abroad, then there should be no child benefit or child tax credit at all no matter how long they have worked in the UK and no matter how much tax they have paid. And we will introduce a new residency requirement for social housing - meaning that you can't even be considered for a council house unless you have been here for at least four years. This is about saying: our welfare system is like a national club. It's made up of the contribution of hardworking British taxpayers. Millions of people doing the right thing, paying into the system, generation after generation. It cannot be right that migrants can turn up and claim full rights to this club straightaway. So let's be clear what all of these changes taken together will mean. EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here. UK taxpayers will not support them if they don't. And once they are in work, they won't get benefits or social housing from Britain unless they have been here for at least four years. Yes, these are radical reforms But they are also reasonable and fair. And the British people need to know that changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an absolute requirement in the renegotiation. I am confident that they will reduce significantly EU migration to the UK. And that is what I am determined to deliver. My very clear aim is to be able to negotiate these changes for the whole EU, because I believe they would benefit the whole EU. They take account of the particular circumstances of our own welfare system, and they go with the grain of what other Member States with high numbers of EU benefit claimants are considering. And of course we would expect them to apply on a reciprocal basis to British citizens elsewhere in the EU. But if negotiating for the whole EU should not prove possible, I would want to see them included in a UK-only settlement. Now I know many will say this is impossible - just impossible. Some of the most ardent supporters of the European Union will say it is impossible - fearing that if an accommodation is made for Britain, the whole European Union will unravel. And those who passionately want Britain to leave the European Union will say it is impossible - and that the only way to control migration into the UK is to leave the EU. On this, at least, they will agree. To those who claim change is impossible, I respond with one word, the most powerful word in the English language. Why? Why is it impossible? Why is it impossible to find a way forward on this issue, and on other issues, that meet the real concerns of a major Member State, one of the biggest net contributors to the EU budget? I simply don't accept such defeatism. I say to our European partners. We have real concerns. Our concerns are not outlandish or unreasonable. We deserve to be heard, and we must be heard. Not only for Britain's sake, but for the sake of Europe as a whole. Because what is happening in Britain is not unique to Britain. Across the European Union, issues of migration are causing real concern and raising real questions. Can movements on the scale we have seen in recent years always be in the best interests of the EU and wider European solidarity? Can it be in the interests of central and eastern European Member States that so many of their brightest and best are drawn away from home when they are needed most? This concern takes a different form in different Member States, and has different causes. But it has one common feature: it is contributing to a corrosion of trust in the European Union and the rise of populist parties. If we ignore it, it will not go away. Across the European Union we are seeing the frustrations of our citizens, demonstrated in the results of the European Elections. Leadership means dealing with those frustrations, not turning a deaf ear to them. And we have a duty to act on them, to restore the democratic legitimacy of the EU. So I say to our friends in Europe. It's time we talked about this properly. And a conversation cannot begin with the word \\"no\\". The entire European Union is built on a gift for compromise, for finding ways round difficult corners, for accepting that sometimes we have to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good. That is the way the EU operates. That is the way a Union of 28 democracies has to operate. Flexibility not rigidity. Creativity not dogma. Only this month a way was found to accommodate France breaching its budget deficit limit, as everyone knew it would be. And it can be done again. Two years ago, at Bloomberg, I set out my vision for a reformed European Union. I stand by every word of that speech today. A reformed EU, in the interests not only of Britain, but of every Member State. Of course I know the arguments that will be put. It will be argued that freedom of movement is a holy principle - one of the four cardinal principles of the EU, alongside freedom of capital, of services and of goods - and that what we are suggesting is heresy. To which I say: hang on a moment. No one claims that the other three freedoms have yet been fully implemented. Far from it. It is still not possible for a British optician to trade freely in Italy, or a French company to raise funds in Germany. It is still not possible for consumers to access their Netflix or iTunes accounts across borders in the EU. And freedom of movement itself is not absolute. There are rules for when new Member States join the EU precisely to cope with excessive numbers. So why can't there be steps to allow Member States a greater degree of control, in order to uphold a general and important principle, but one which is already qualified? And of course freedom of movement has evolved significantly over the years from applying to job-holders to job-seekers too from job-seekers to their non-European family members and from a right to work, to a right to claim a range of benefits. So I am saying to our European partners. I ask you to work with us on this. I know some of you will be saying: why bother? Some of you may even say that in public. To which my answer is clear: because it is worth it. Look at what Britain brings to Europe. The fastest growing economy and the second largest. One of Europe's strongest powers. A country which in many ways invented the single market, and which brings real heft to Europe's influence on the world stage. Here is an issue which matters to the British people, and to our future in the European Union. The British people will not understand - frankly I will not understand - if a sensible way through cannot be found, which will help settle this country's place in the EU once and for all. And to the British people I say this. I share your concern, and I am acting on it. I know how much this matters. Judge me by my record in Europe. I promised we would cut the EU budget - and we have. I said I would veto a Treaty that was not in our interests, and I did. I do not pretend this will be easy. It won't. It will require a lot of hard pounding, a lot of hard negotiation. But it will be worth it. Because those who promise you simple solutions are betraying you. Those who say we would certainly be better off outside the EU only ever tell you part of the story. Of course we would survive, there is no doubt about that. But we would need to weigh in the balance the loss of our instant access to the single market, and our right to take the decisions that regulate it. And we would of course lose the automatic right for the 1.3 million British citizens who today are living and working elsewhere in Europe to do so. That is something we would want to think carefully about giving up. For me, I have one test, and one test only: what is in the best, long term interests of Britain? That is the measure against which everything must be judged. If you elect me as Prime Minister in May, I will negotiate to reform the European Union, and Britain's relationship with it. This issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation. If I succeed, I will, as I have said, campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU. If our concerns fall on deaf ears and we cannot put our relationship with the EU on a better footing, then of course I rule nothing out. But I am confident that, with goodwill and understanding, we can and will succeed. At the end of the day, whatever happens, the final decision will be yours, when you place your cross on the ballot paper in the referendum to decide whether Britain remains in the European Union. That decision is for you, the British people, and for you alone.

He sees two \\"good\\" children doing household chores and playing with their dolls, but finds a third child, Moss Garcia, rifling through a Penthouse magazine and cutting out a nude photograph. Harry runs back home and writes Moss's name in his \\"Bad Boys &amp; Girls\\" book. On his way home, Harry peeps into the window of a local bar and sees coworker Frank Stoller, who earlier that day had phoned in sick, requiring Harry to take his place on the assembly line. Harry becomes angry and rushes home, hums a Christmas tune, and breaks one of his male dollhouse figures. The following morning he phones his younger brother Phil (Jeffrey DeMunn) and cancels Thanksgiving dinner. At the company Christmas party, the owner of Jolly Dreams announces that, if production increases sufficiently, the company will be able to donate toys to the disadvantaged children at Willowy Springs State Hospital.

This article: The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas,  and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the  ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible  to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions   were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship.

Question: suppose the bird just found a nest happens, how will it affect MORE coffee being made.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"C: no effect A bird finding a nest has no direct impact on the process of making coffee as outlined in the provided steps. The process of making coffee involves filling the coffee pot with water, pouring water into the machine, placing a filter in the basket, measuring ground coffee into the filter, turning on the machine, and allowing the hot water passing through the grounds to drip into the pot. The presence or actions of a bird finding a nest are unrelated to the operation of a coffee machine or the materials necessary for making coffee. Birds and their nests exist outside the scope of the coffee-making process and do not interact with the components or variables that affect the output of coffee. In order to affect the production of more or less coffee, there would need to be a change in one or more factors involved in the coffee-making process itself. These factors could include: 1. A change in the amount of water poured into the machine, which would limit the volume of coffee produced. 2. A change in the quantity of ground coffee placed in the filter, resulting in either a stronger/weaker coffee or a full/empty pot. 3. A change in the machine's settings or function, such as an adjust to brewing temperature or a malfunction. Based on the question, the incident involving the bird and the nest does not interfere with any of these factors that influence coffee production. Consequently, it would have no effect on the overall output of coffee, resulting in option C being the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given that the answer to a question is \\"grateful as a result\\", what is the question?","output":"The question could be: \\"How did the others feel towards Addison after she used her own power to keep things going for them?\\"  Addison is portrayed as an individual who possesses some sort of 'power'. The nature of this power isn't specified but it's clear that it's something that benefits others.  This power could be an array of things: it could be an authority position that allows her to control resources; it could be a personal power such as excellent problem-solving skills or resilience or perhaps a high degree of social influence. Regardless, she uses this power not for her own benefit, but to keep things going for the people around her. This action likely required a good amount of sacrifice and selflessness on her part. In such scenarios, where one person voluntarily uses their resources for the benefit of others, the recipients tend to feel a lot of gratitude. This is what makes the people in the story \\"grateful as a result\\". Through Addison's actions, she managed to provide security for people in times of uncertainty, whilst also showing empathy and altruism. This has a profound impact on the dynamics of human relationships and prompts feelings of gratitude. The gratitude they experience could evolve into a range of things. They might be more supportive of Addison in future, develop an aspiration to be like her or even take steps to make similar sacrifices for others, thereby creating a cycle of positivity.

As a matter of fact, the foam is where young spittlebugs  live. These insects are protected by the foam, and they usually don't do much harm to the plants. As we all know, in late summer, a mother spittlebug lays her eggs on the plant. The babies will hatch  in spring. After they come to the new world, they begin to eat juice from the plant. The babies eat more juice than their bodies need for food. The extra juice mixes with a special waste that the spittlebugs produce. When this fluid  is released, it mixes with the air, forming bubbly foam. What is so great about having a foam home? The space inside is so wet that it can keep the bugs' soft bodies from drying out. And the foam tastes bad, so it keeps away most animals that would eat the bugs. Some birds will reach their heads through the foam to find the bugs. Wasps and ants might eat them, too. But most of the bugs stay safe inside the foam. Once the bugs have grown into adults, they stop making foam. They leave their homes and jump from plant to plant in search of food. The adults look a little like tiny frogs. For this reason they are also called froghoppers. If you see some foam on a plant, you might want to take a careful look inside. Gently push some of the foam aside with a small stick. Deep inside you may see a few insects eating plant juice. They might also be making more foam. Be sure to push the foam back after a moment to cover the insects and keep them safe. Soon the spittlebugs will grow up and leave their foam home. They will join the other insects in the grassland.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Don’t be content with simply landing a job in the publicity field—avail yourself of every resource available to you to hone your craft and continue advancing. Accept challenging projects graciously, form beneficial connections with as many industry heavy-hitters as you can and always look for new ways to make your work stand out. Where you end up depends entirely on how willing you are to keep learning new things. Periodically attending workshops and seminars can give you fresh ideas and motivation to stay at the top of your game. When engaged in public relations work, you need to know how to present compelling addresses and written materials that frame your client in the best possible light. This falls under the heading of rhetoric (the art of being convincing through language) and it is arguably the most essential skill any publicist or marketing specialist should possess. Even when you’re not actively trying to convince the public of any one particular fact, every strategy should be formulated as though you were making a logically-supported, directed appeal. Your credibility as a public relations expert will be assured with an understanding of the central tenets of rhetorical discourse.  Use the “rhetorical triangle” model to structure your statements and press releases: understand the relationship between yourself (the presenter), the audience and the context of an argument. This will help ensure that argument takes hold in the minds of your audience.  Always have a clear goal in mind whenever you begin a project, no matter how minor or routine. The language of your press materials should be centered around this goal. A good deal of public relations work involves taking negative or confusing circumstances and recasting them in a positive light. This requires you to be able to call upon your creative faculties and make them a well-worn tool in your arsenal. Study the habits of creative people, take notice of even the smallest details and learn to improvise. The better you are at thinking up ways to elevate your client in the public eye, the more status you’ll gain in your profession.  Try incorporating brief creative mental exercises into your daily routine, such as concocting fictional histories for people and places you’ve never seen before, or highlighting one word per line in a newspaper column to tell a short story. The term “spin” deals with changing the appearance of circumstantial details to preserve one’s reputation, not fabricating those details. You should never lie or alter the facts in order to make your client look better. As a publicist, you haven’t done your job unless you’ve enhanced the visibility, demand and public approval of your client. For this reason, how well you yourself do is primarily a matter of what you’re able to accomplish for the people you serve. Though you may sometimes be called upon to speak on behalf of your client or act as a mouthpiece for a publicity campaign, much of your work will be done behind the scenes and will help inform the actions of your clientele. Every evolving situation, good or bad, should be viewed as an opportunity to improve your client’s standing. Work closely with the client or their manager or agent to devise guided and effective PR strategies.","output":"To be good at your job in publicity, always learn new things and get better at what you do. Work hard and make friends with important people in your industry. Be really good at talking and writing in a way that makes people believe and like your client.

The majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoia kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897. Which families help to start cultural, industrial, and economic growth in Palermo?","output":"Several families helped to initiate cultural, industrial, and economic growth in Palermo during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These influential families include: 1. The Florio family: Involved in various industries, including shipping, tuna fishing, wine production, and banking, the Florios played a pivotal role in Palermo's development. They commissioned Ernesto Basile to design the Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, a prime example of the city's Art Nouveau architecture. 2. The Ducrot family: Known for their contributions to the furniture industry and interior design, the Ducrots helped enhance the artistic landscape of Palermo. 3. The Rutelli family: A prominent old Italian family, the Rutellis were involved in the construction business. They contributed to Palermo's growth through their firm Rutelli & Machì, which built the enormous Teatro Massimo, designed by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile. 4. The Sandron family: Although lesser-known compared to others on this list, the Sandron family also played a significant role in advancing Palermo's industrial development. 5. The Whitaker family: With British origins, the Whitaker family established themselves in Sicily as wine producers and merchants. Their economic activities, which included the export of Marsala wine, fostered growth in the region. 6. The Utveggio family: Known for their entrepreneurship and involvement in trade, the Utveggio family's enterprises contributed to the city's economic progress. Together, these families significantly influenced the cultural, economic, and industrial growth of Palermo during an era of expansion and transformation.

Movie title: The Three Musketeers Context: Callow youth D'Artagnan (Walter Abel) sets off from Gascony for Paris, armed with his father's sword, an old horse and a letter of introduction to his godfather, Captain de Treville (Lumsden Hare), commander of the King's Musketeers. Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well. His three new friends secure him free lodging by threatening landlord Bernajou (Murray Kinnell) with an imaginary law and find him a servant named Planchet (John Qualen). That night, D'Artagnan is pleasantly surprised when Bernajou's ward Constance (Heather Angel) enters the room. It turns out that it is actually her chamber, though she is rarely there, as she spends most of her time at the palace as lady-in-waiting to the Queen. Constance has arranged a rendezvous between Queen Anne (Rosamond Pinchot) and her lover, the English Duke of Buckingham (Ralph Forbes).

It can be really perplexing to see a woman -- maybe even an attractive woman -- do things like go to work and earn her own money and, say, buy her own dinner and drinks and general livelihood without the help of a man; it can be doubly confusing when she does the same job as her male counterparts, just as competently, and then demands she be paid the same, because she's a feminist, dammit.      Conservative talk radio host Doc Thompson totally gets it too. What's more, he gets how difficult it can be when a person doesn't look like the stereotype of an unshaven, braless, makeup-free feminist woman, but instead just looks like your average human being -- except secretly, she (or he!) is someone who believes that everybody, regardless of gender, deserves the same rights, opportunities, treatment and respect. It is almost too scary to contemplate. ||||| Grab your binoculars. If you've ever wanted to know what a feminist looks like, some people on Twitter are here to define it for you, whether you think they're being helpful or not.      The trending hashtag #HowToSpotAFeminist was started on Sunday by conservative radio host Doc Thompson for his show, The Morning Blaze, which was founded by former FOX commentator, Glenn Beck.      Thompson's Twitter account retweeted plenty of their favorite anti-feminist responses from listeners and followers.      Some made attempts at sparking a debate, but most responses at Thompson's hashtag were aimed at making jokes that perpetuated the common \\"feminazi\\" stereotype, ample with misandry and body hair.

His brother Hank (Ethan Hawke), needs money to pay child support or else his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) will cut him out of his daughter's life. Andy devises a plan to rob their parents' jewelry store, which Hank reluctantly agrees to. Andy argues that he cannot go himself because he has been in the neighborhood recently, and could therefore be recognized. They assume that only the old woman who works for their parents will be in the store. Andy states that only a toy gun is needed and that it is a victimless crime, because the insurance will repay their parents.Without consulting Andy, Hank hires a co-worker who is also an experienced thief, Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O'Byrne), to help him in the robbery. In fact, Bobby will do it himself (with a real and loaded gun); Hank just needs to wait in the car. The brothers' mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris) happens to be in the store herself filling in for the original clerk. The robbery goes awry when Nanette pulls a hidden gun on Bobby, causing a shootout. Hank flees the scene after seeing Bobby shot to death. Nanette dies later in the hospital after her husband Charles (Albert Finney) agrees to take her off life support. Charles, unsatisfied with the police's help, decides to investigate on his own as he knows that Bobby had a partner in crime and becomes obsessed with finding the other criminal (Hank).Hank finds himself fixing many problems while Andy only chastises him for his mistake.

It is thought that we won't have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet. There will be fewer books because we will be able to get all texts from computers. The Internet will be used to play games, see films and buy food. Most telephone calls will be made by computers, too. Some people are glad about these new ways of shopping and communicating . Others do not think that computers will replace  our old ways. Let's take books for example. Some people think that one day we won't read books made of paper. Instead, we will buy and read books using computers. We will read texts on small pocket computers. The computers will keep many different books in them at the same time. We won't need to turn lots of pages and paper will be saved. Computerized books will be used more and more.

However, there is an underlying sadness about Chris, which we'll learn more about later.One evening, Chris cuts his finger by accident in the kitchen while making dinner and washes the finger under the faucet and looks at the cut. (Important later on). He is then visited by two men who give him a video message from his friend, Dr. Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), who has relayed this message from Prometheus, a space station in orbit around the planet Solaris. Solaris is an ocean planet that is being researched for its commercial or resource potential. Dr. Gibarian implores Chris to come to the space station, not explaining why exactly, but that something incredible has happened and that he has to come and see for himself. The two men explain to Chris that contact has been lost with the space station; an intervention team was sent and not heard from again. The government may abandon the station and the crew unless Chris travels up there to find out what happened.Chris makes the trip to the space station and upon arrival finds it mostly empty. However, stains of blood are everywhere on the walls. He stumbles upon a makeshift morgue and is devastated to find Dr. Gibarian as one of two dead people on the slab. As Chris leaves the room, he fails to notice blood accumulating in the ceiling panels.He proceeds to find only two survivors of the crew in the space station.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. To provide a detailed and long explanation, let's break down both sentences and see the relationship between the information they provide. Sentence 1: The Thress model suggests that if the discount remains unchanged, and thus that shifting is not allowed, the elasticity of basic volume is negative 0.189 and of workshared volume is negative 0.289. This sentence provides the following information: 1. The context or condition is that the Thress model is being cited. This model operates under the assumption that discounts on the products/services remain unchanged, and there is no allowance for shifting between the basic and workshared volumes. 2. Under these conditions, the Thress model predicts specific elasticity values for the basic and workshared volumes. Elasticity is a measure of how responsive a variable (in this case, the basic and workshared volumes) is to a change in another variable (such as price or discount rates). 3. The elasticity of the basic volume is given as negative 0.189. This means that a 1% increase in the price or a decrease in the discount of the basic volume would result in a 0.189% decrease in the basic volume. 4. The elasticity of the workshared volume is given as negative 0.289. This means that a 1% increase in the price or a decrease in the discount of the workshared volume would result in a 0.289% decrease in the workshared volume. Sentence 2: The elasticity of basic volume is negative 0.189 according to the Thress model. This sentence outlines the following information: 1. The context is that the Thress model is being cited again. This consistency in the source of information connects the two sentences. 2. The main point of this sentence is that the elasticity of the basic volume is negative 0.189. This reaffirms the point made in sentence 1. Based on this analysis, sentence 2 is indeed entailed by sentence 1 as the statement about the basic volume elasticity being negative 0.189 is explicitly mentioned in both sentences.

And I was wondering How would Jordan feel afterwards? Answer:","output":"Jordan would likely experience an overwhelming mix of emotions after searching high and low for his lost puppy without finding it. It is natural for pet owners, like Jordan, to develop strong emotional bonds with their pets, which makes the prospect of losing them quite distressing. In this situation, it is possible that Jordan would feel the following emotions, amongst others: 1. Sadness and despair: Not finding his lost puppy would leave Jordan feeling incredibly sad and disheartened. The sorrow of potentially not seeing his beloved pet again and the uncertainty of his puppy's fate would certainly weigh heavily on his emotions and state of mind. 2. Frustration and helplessness: Despite his best efforts in searching for the puppy, the lack of success might lead Jordan to feelings of frustration and helplessness. He may feel powerless to further influence the situation or be unsure of what next steps to take in his search efforts. This lack of control can exacerbate Jordan's emotional stress during this challenging time. 3. Anxiety and worry: The uncertainties surrounding his puppy's situation would make Jordan understandably anxious and concerned. He may worry about whether his puppy is safe, if it has adequate food and water, or if it has fallen into the hands of someone with ill intentions. Additionally, he could be fearful that any additional time passing will decrease his chances of reuniting with his lost pet. 4. Regret and guilt: Pet owners often feel responsible for the well-being of their pets, so it is very possible that Jordan may blame himself for the disappearance of his puppy. He may experience feelings of regret about not supervising the puppy more closely or not taking additional precautions to ensure its safety. This self-blame and guilt can contribute to the emotional distress Jordan is likely experiencing. 5. Hopefulness and determination: Despite the disappointment and discouragement, it is possible for Jordan to still possess a level of hopefulness and determination. He might believe that he'll eventually find the puppy or that the puppy will find its way home. This optimism may be what keeps him actively searching and seeking help from others in his quest to recover his lost pet. In conclusion, losing a beloved pet like a puppy can be a traumatic and heart-wrenching experience. It is natural for Jordan to experience a mix of emotions, ranging from sadness and frustration to hope and determination. It is essential for Jordan to find a support system of friends, family, and pet-related professionals to help him navigate his search efforts and manage his emotional well-being during this difficult time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Andrew Michael Sullivan (born 10 August 1963) is an English-born American author, editor, and blogger. Sullivan is a conservative political commentator, a former editor of The New Republic, and the author or editor of six books. He was a pioneer of the political blog, starting his in 2000. He eventually moved his blog to various publishing platforms, including Time, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and finally an independent subscription-based format. Sullivan, like Marshall Kirk, Hunter Madsen, and Bruce Bawer, has been described by Urvashi Vaid as a proponent of \\"legitimation\\", seeing the objective of the gay rights movement as being \\"mainstreaming gay and lesbian people\\" rather than \\"radical social change\\". Sullivan wrote the first major article in the United States advocating for gay people to be given the right to marry, published in The New Republic in 1989. Many gay rights organisations attacked him for the stance at the time. Many on \\"the gay left\\" believed that he was promoting \\"assimilation\\" into \\"straight culture\\", when the aim of most at that time was to alter codes of sexuality and society as a whole, rather than fitting gays into it. However, his arguments eventually became widely accepted and formed the basis of the modern movement to allow same-sex marriage. In the wake of the United States Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage in 2013 (Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor), New York Times op-ed columnist Ross Douthat suggested that Sullivan might be the most influential political writer of his generation, writing, \\"No intellectual that I can think of, writing on a fraught and controversial topic, has seen their once-crankish, outlandish-seeming idea become the conventional wisdom so quickly, and be instantantiated so rapidly in law and custom.\\"  Sullivan opposes hate crime laws, arguing that they undermine freedom of speech and equal protection. He also opposes the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, arguing that it would \\"not make much of a difference\\" and that the \\"gay rights establishment\\" was wrong to oppose a version of the bill that did not include protections for gender identity. Sullivan opposed calls to remove Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla and argued that \\"old-fashioned liberalism brought gay equality to America far, far faster than identity politics leftism.\\"  In 2006, Sullivan was named as an LGBT History Month icon. Did he ever win any awards for his writings?","output":"Andrew Sullivan was named an LGBT History Month icon in 2006.

Process:  - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more food available happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER nests.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation i.e., more food being available, may have both direct and indirect effects on the process of nest building by a bird.  Stepping through the process:  1. The bird picks a tree: More availability of food might impact the bird's choice of tree. With more food available, location of the tree could be chosen with respect to proximity to the food source rather than solely on safety.  2. The bird collects twigs and other refuse: This part of the process may not be directly affected by food availability, as it primarily depends on materials for building rather than sustenance.  3. The bird makes a flat base with twigs: Again, this step is less likely to be influenced by food availability.  4. The bird makes sides with twigs and other things: This step too is more about construction material and less about food, hence would not be directly affected. 5. The bird adds softer material to the inside: Similarly, this part of the nest-building process would not be directly affected by the availability of food.  6. The nest is done: The completion stage is again largely independent of food availability.  Indirectly, however, more availability of food could potentially lead to healthier and stronger birds. This could result in them being able to collect more high-quality materials more quickly, potentially leading to larger, sturdier nests.  Therefore, it seems that the nest sizes might remain stable or possibly become larger rather than less or smaller. Availability of more food essentially allows birds to spend more energy and time on nest building, instead of searching for food. But it's also worth noting that there are many variables at play (such as the bird species, specific environmental conditions, predation risks, etc.) that could also influence how the nest building process might change due to increased food availability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the story snippet, we learn that: - Stewart has a favorite task. - He was so focused on completing it that he forgot about the fire. - He was cold, so he used blankets to get warm and comfortable. Step 2: Determine what might logically happen next based on the information. Given that Stewart is now warm and content, there are a few things that could happen next: - He could fall asleep because of the warmth and coziness. - He might decide to continue working on his favorite task since he's comfortable now. - Stewart could also realize that he needs to tend to the fire. Step 3: Select a plausible and interesting event to happen next. Out of the options above, let's choose for Stewart to realize he needs to tend to the fire. This creates a nice balance of focusing on his task while also attending to his environment. Step 4: Elaborate on the chosen event. As Stewart gradually began to warm up beneath the blankets, he realized that it wouldn't be enough to keep the chill at bay for the entire night. He glanced at the dying embers of the fire, understanding that he needed to rekindle it before it went out completely. Step 5: Present the next part of the story. Feeling a renewed sense of urgency, Stewart reluctantly set aside his blankets and favorite task. Carefully, he added kindling to the fire, coaxing the dancing flames back to life. As the room filled with warmth again, he sighed in relief and found renewed motivation to finish his favorite task, all while keeping an eye on the comforting glow of the fire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(November 2015) Sidhu (Akshay Kumar) is a lowly vegetable cutter at a roadside food stall in the Chandni Chowk section of Delhi, who consults astrologers, tarot card readers, and fake fakirs despite his foster father Dada's (Mithun Chakraborty) exhortations. When two strangers from China claim him as a reincarnation of war hero 'Liu Shen' and take him to China, Sidhu, encouraged by trickster Chopstick (Ranvir Shorey), believes he will be feted as a hero, unaware of his own recruitment to assassinate the smuggler Hojo (Gordon Liu). Sidhu travels to China with Chopstick. Along the way he meets Sakhi (Deepika Padukone), the Indian-Chinese spokesmodel known as Ms. Tele Shoppers Media, or Ms. TSM, who also appears in China. Her twin sister Suzy, known as the femme fatale Meow Meow, works for Hojo, not knowing Hojo tried to kill her father, Inspector Chiang (Roger Yuan). Sidhu, through a series of accidents, initially eludes Hojo, but Hojo eventually exposes him as a fraud. Thereupon Hojo kills Dada, and Sidhu is beaten and urinated on by Hojo. Injured and disgraced Sidhu vows revenge. He thereafter encounters an amnesiac vagrant, whom he later identifies to Sakhi as Inspector Chiang. Chiang later recovers his memory and trains Sidhu in kung fu. When Hojo again meets with Sidhu, Suzy injures Chiang; but upon seeing Sakhi, betrays Hojo. Sidhu fights Hojo in single combat, eventually using a modified vegetable-cutting technique to overwhelm him. In the aftermath, Sidhu opens a vegetable stall in China, but is recruited to fight for some African pygmies. The film thereupon concludes with the announcement \\"To be Continued â Chandni Chowk to Africa\\".

The gap widens between ground folks and senior leadership b). the founder lack skills to take their vision to actionable work c). the employee followers lack structure d). not enough information Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"On this subject, the economically stronger EU countries must participate. The sentence in French, \\"À ce propos, les pays de l'UE plus forts au point de vue économique doivent y participer,\\" discusses the notion that countries within the European Union (EU) that possess greater economic strength should be more involved and take an active role in the context that the sentence was mentioned. The commitment and participation of these countries are crucial and beneficial, as it brings about a more balanced and effective partnership helping in the growth and progression of the European Union and all its member states. The involvement of the economically stronger EU countries can take various forms, including financial assistance, initiating and promoting cooperative projects, sharing technology and knowledge, as well as fostering a sense of unity and collaboration in addressing common concerns and goals. To create a more integrated and cooperative Europe, it is essential for member countries to actively contribute according to their capabilities and resources to achieve mutual benefits and objectives. Moreover, these economically stronger countries can also serve as role models, setting positive examples of policy reforms and development approaches that help accomplish the EU's shared aspirations of economic growth, social progress, and stability. Additionally, their participation can encourage further cooperation and strengthen the ties between member states. Furthermore, the input from these countries can help address several challenges that the European Union faces, including economic disparities across member states, the need for a more innovative and competitive European market, and tackling issues like unemployment and regional disparities. Collaboration becomes even more critical when considering current global challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, migration, and geopolitical tensions. By having economically stronger EU countries take greater responsibility and play a more active role, the European Union can bolster its collective capacity to respond to these challenges and work toward a more sustainable and prosperous future for all its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dallol Ethiopia has what claim to fame?","output":"Dallol, Ethiopia, holds several claims to fame due to its exceptional geography, climate, and geological features. Some of these are: 1. Hottest inhabited place on Earth: Dallol holds the record for the hottest year-round average temperature. With an average annual temperature of 94.3°F (34.6°C), the area is well-known for its extreme heat. The temperature typically remains consistently hot throughout the year, with variations being relatively minimal. 2. Lowest land volcano: Dallol is considered the lowest land volcano in the world. Located in the Afar Depression, a region considered to be part of the East African Rift, Dallol's volcanic crater lies at an elevation of 150 feet (45 meters) below sea level. Its distinctive geology and extremely low elevation make it a significant hotspot for researchers. 3. Vibrant colors and unique hydrothermal features: Dallol is famed for its other-worldly landscapes and vivid mineral deposits, which create a unique visual spectacle. The area is dotted with colorful hot springs, acidic lakes, and mineral deposits such as sulfur, iron oxide, and salt formations. The combination of the geothermal activity and the mineral-rich pools creates a landscape like no other, often compared to an alien planet. 4. Large salt deposits: The Afar Depression, where Dallol is located, is home to one of the most significant deposits of evaporite salts in the world. It includes vast salt pans and salt flats, which have been a source of income for the Afar people for centuries via salt mining and trade. 5. Danakil Depression: Dallol is situated within the Danakil Depression, one of the lowest, driest, and most inhospitable places on Earth. With an average yearly rainfall of only 100-200 millimeters (4-8 inches), the region is classified as a hyper-arid desert environment. 6. Tectonic activity: The Dallol area sits atop active tectonic plates – the African Plate and the Arabian Plate – which are responsible for the East African Rift. This underlying tectonic activity contributes to the geothermal and volcanic activity in the region. 7. Historical site for early hominids: The Afar region, including Dallol, is known for being a prevalent site for paleoanthropological discoveries of early hominid remains. The most famous of these being the 3.2-million-year-old fossilized remains of a hominid named Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis), discovered in the Hadar area of the Afar region in 1974. 8. Extreme tourism destination: Due to its harsh climate, striking landscapes, and unique geological features, Dallol has become a sought-after destination for adventurous travelers seeking an extreme tourism experience. However, safety precautions are paramount as the environment can be highly unpredictable and dangerous. These factors make Dallol, Ethiopia, an extraordinary and fascinating place to study, research, and visit, contributing to its well-deserved claim to fame."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Anaheim (pronounced ) is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous city in Orange County and the 10th most populous city in California. Anaheim is the second largest city in Orange County in terms of land area (after Irvine) and is known for its theme parks, sports teams, and convention center.  - In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer.  - In baseball and softball, a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the starting pitcher is removed due to injury, ineffectiveness, fatigue, ejection, or for other strategic reasons, such as being substituted by a pinch hitter. Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles, such as closers, set-up relief pitchers, middle relief pitchers, left/right-handed specialists, and long relievers. Whereas starting pitchers usually rest several days before pitching in a game again due to the number of pitches thrown, relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch more games but with fewer innings pitched. A team's staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team's bullpen, which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games, and where they warm-up prior to entering the game.  - Lori Harrigan - Mack ( born September 5 , 1970 ) is an American , former collegiate All - American , right - handed hitting , left - handed softball pitcher originally from Anaheim , California . She was a three - time Olympic Champion as a member of the Team USA winning in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 .

The ISF is a non-profit corporation recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and SportAccord (formerly the General Association of International Sports Federations).  - In baseball (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent's first batter of a game. A pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - Catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to this primary duty, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket.  - The 2010 United States Census, (known as \\"Census 2010\\"), is the twenty-third and currently most recent United States national census. National Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2010. As part of a drive to increase the count's accuracy, 635,000 temporary enumerators were hired. The population of the United States was counted as 308,745,538, a 9.7% increase from the 2000 Census.  - The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) is a volunteer, non-profit organization based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was founded in 1933 with a tournament held in Chicago that was organized by Leo Fischer and Michael J. Pauley. The following year the 1934 National Recreation Congress recognized the ASA. Shortly afterward the ASA was located in Newark, New Jersey. A world amateur softball tournament was held by the ASA at Chicago's Soldier Field that started on September 7, 1939. The ASA moved to Oklahoma City on January 1, 1966.  - In baseball, innings pitched (IP) are the number of innings a pitcher has completed, measured by the number of batters and baserunners that are put out while the pitcher is on the pitching mound in a game. Three outs made is equal to one inning pitched. One out counts as one-third of an inning, and two outs counts as two-thirds of an inning. Sometimes, the statistic is written 34.1, 72.2, or 91.0, for example, to represent innings, innings, and 91 innings exactly, respectively.  - A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fastpitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it (and baseball) were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will be reinstated for the 2020 Games.  - An inning in baseball, softball, and similar games is the basic unit of play, consisting of two halves or frames, the \\"top\\" (first half) and the \\"bottom\\" (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense. A full game typically is scheduled for nine innings, although this may be shortened due to weather or extended in the event that the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings.

Context: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.  Question: \\"Under the new measure, how much would the portion that goes to legal aid increase?\\" Response: \\"It would double\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choose your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","output":"b). yes The correct answer is \\"yes\\" because the passage states that the proposed bill would double the portion of the fee that goes to legal aid: in district court, it would go up to 10 from 5, and in circuit court, it would go up to 20 from 10. So the response saying \\"It would double\\" is factually correct.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

After her little boy \\"lost it\\" the mother probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Better understands the hospitals 12 and older visitation policy.  B.

Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself...

Article:","output":"Title: The Simple Way to Create Custom Lip Gloss at Home Introduction The art of crafting your personalized lip gloss at home has gained popularity in recent years, providing a fun and creative way for people to express themselves through their makeup. By making your lip gloss, you can customize both the color and sparkle you desire, resulting in a unique lip product that complements your style and personality. Not only is it a cost-effective alternative to commercial lip glosses, but it also allows for a more sustainable choice by reusing and refilling containers instead of buying new ones constantly. In this article, we will guide you through the process of transferring your homemade lip gloss mixture to a small container, allowing it to harden and be ready for use whenever you want. Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients To create your customized lip gloss, you will need the following items: 1. A base – This can be either a clear lip gloss, petroleum jelly, or a mixture of coconut oil and beeswax.  2. Colorant - For adding color to your lip gloss, choose pigments like cosmetic-grade micas, natural food coloring or crushed, lipstick shavings. 3. Sparkle - For added shimmer, consider using cosmetic-grade glitter or mica powder, responsibly sourced and skin-safe.  4. Flavor or scent (optional) - To personalize the lip gloss further, add a couple of drops of essential oils or edible extracts for a unique scent or flavor boost. Step 2: Mix Your Ingredients Combine your base, colorant, sparkle, and optional scent or flavor in a small mixing bowl. Make sure to stir the ingredients until they are fully incorporated and reach a smooth and uniform consistency. You may need to adjust the proportions of the colorant and sparkle to achieve the desired shade and shimmer effect. Step 3: Prepare Your Container Choose a small and suitable container for your lip gloss. You can opt for a new container or repurpose an old or empty lip gloss tube. Thoroughly clean and sanitize the container before filling it with the lip gloss mixture. Step 4: Transfer the Mixture Using a spatula or a small spoon, carefully transfer your lip gloss mixture into the selected container. This step may be a bit tricky, especially if you chose a small container with a narrow opening. To make this process easier, you can use a disposable piping bag or a small plastic bag with a corner snipped off, allowing you to squeeze the mixture effortlessly into the container with precision. Step 5: Let the Lip Gloss Harden Once you have filled the container with the lip gloss mixture, close it tightly, and let the lip gloss harden. This process may take a couple of hours up to an entire day, depending on the type of base used in the mixture. Placing the container in the refrigerator can help speed up the hardening time. Step 6: Enjoy Your Custom Lip Gloss After your lip gloss has hardened, it's finally ready for use! Apply your lip gloss with the help of a lip brush or your fingertips whenever you want to add a touch of color or sparkle to your lips. Remember to store your lip gloss in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, to preserve its quality. Conclusion Creating and using your custom lip gloss not only offers immense satisfaction, but also presents an opportunity for exploring your creativity and personal style. By following these simple steps to transfer, harden, and use your lip gloss, you can enjoy the benefits of a one-of-a-kind product while being a conscientious consumer in terms of cost and sustainability. So, gather your ingredients and start experimenting to discover your unique lip gloss look today!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The net effect is calculated through the formula: net effect = x + y + (xy/100) Where x is the first change and y is the second change. In this case, x is -25 (representing a reduction in the price) and y is 75 (representing an increase in sales). Now using the formula:  Net effect = -25 + 75 + (-25*75/100) Net effect = 50 - 18.75 = 31.25  However, since the options given are integers only, we round this up to 31 (since 31.25 is much closer to 31 than to 32).

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \\"barbarians\\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. drinking  B. playing poker  C. sit  D. talk  E. being greedy A:","output":"When having food, the most suitable option among the given choices is A. drinking. Drinking is a common act of consumption that accompanies food consumption. It is not only a natural complement to eating, but it is also essential to our overall health and well-being. Drinking, especially water, while eating is essential for a variety of reasons: 1. Maintaining hydration: As humans, we require an adequate intake of fluids to keep our bodies functioning optimally. Thus, drinking during meals helps us maintain our fluid balance, as both food and beverages contribute to our daily fluid intake. 2. Aiding digestion: Drinking water and other liquids can facilitate the breakdown and digestion of food in our stomachs. Consuming beverages such as water or tea can help dissolve food particles, making it easier for the digestive system to process and absorb nutrients. 3. Lubrication and protection: Drinking during meals can create a lubricating effect that helps protect the throat and esophagus. Water, for instance, can moisten and soften food, making it simpler to swallow without causing discomfort or irritation. 4. Enhancing taste and flavors: Beverages can complement the flavors of food and enhance the overall dining experience. For example, pairing a glass of wine with a specific dish can result in a more enjoyable and elevated sensory experience due to the combination of flavors and aroma. 5. Facilitating social aspects of eating: In many cultures, sharing drinks during meals is a social activity that fosters conversation, bonding, and celebration. Drinking is often an important aspect of gatherings, as it helps create a relaxed environment, encourages interaction, and signifies hospitality. Therefore, while consuming food, it is most fitting to also engage in the act of drinking, as it not only complements our meals but also plays a crucial role in our health, digestive processes, and social interactions. Other options, such as playing poker (B), sitting (C), talking (D), or being greedy (E), are not as relevant or suitable in answering the above question about acts of consumption during meals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 1: What are some effective ways to minimize/avoid taxes if one gets total salary compensation of 250k in California? Question 2: How much personal income tax would you pay in total in San Francisco, California, if you had 80,000 in salary? Select from: (a). no. (b). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To answer Question 1, here are some effective ways to minimize or avoid taxes on a total salary compensation of 250k in California: 1. Contribute to a 401(k) or retirement account: Max out your annual contribution to reduce taxable income. 2. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts: Contribute to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), which allow you to use pre-tax dollars for qualified medical expenses. 3. Invest in tax-exempt municipal bonds: Interest from these bonds is generally exempt from federal and state income taxes. 4. Deduct mortgage interest: If you own a home, you can deduct mortgage interest on your tax returns. 5. Deduct property taxes: California allows deductions on state and local property taxes up to a certain limit. 6. Benefit from tax credits: Look for opportunities to claim tax credits, such as education or childcare expenses. Remember to consult a tax professional for personalized advice on minimizing or avoiding taxes based on your specific situation. For Question 2, in order to calculate the personal income tax for an 80,000 salary in San Francisco, California, we need to consider federal income tax, state income tax, and any local taxes (if applicable). Here's the step-by-step calculation: Step 1: Calculate federal income tax 1. Identify the federal tax brackets for the given income. 2. Apply the income tax rates based on the tax brackets. 3. Add up the federal income tax liabilities based on each tax bracket. Step 2: Calculate California state income tax 1. Identify the California state tax brackets for the given income. 2. Apply the state income tax rates based on the tax brackets. 3. Add up the California state income tax liabilities based on each tax bracket. Step 3: Add federal and state income taxes 1. Sum the federal income tax and California state income tax amounts obtained from step 1 and step 2. San Francisco does not have local income taxes, so the total personal income tax liability will be the sum of federal and state income taxes. Given the available options: (a) no and (b) yes, it is clear that: Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is about minimizing or avoiding taxes on a 250k salary in California, while Question 2 is about calculating personal income tax on an 80,000 salary in San Francisco, California. So, the answer is (a) no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Make use of the article to answer the questions. Have you ever listened to young children talking in the playground? They are always boasting. They say things like, \\"My Dad's car is bigger than your Dad's,\\" and \\"My Mom is smarter than yours.\\" They particularly like to boast about their families. There were three little boys, Harry, Ted and Gavin, who were always boasting. Gavin was the worst. Everything about his family was always the best or the biggest or the most expensive. Whatever the others said, he could always go on better. One day when they were walking to school, Harry said, \\"My father had a bath twice a week,\\" Ted spoke next. \\"That's nothing,\\" he said. \\"Having a bath twice a week is dirty. My father has a bath every day, sometimes twice a day.\\" Ted looked at Gavin. Now it was his turn. But what could he say? \\"This time,\\" Ted thought, \\"I'm going to win.\\" Gavin didn't know what to say. He couldn't say that his father had a bath three times a day. That was silly. He walked on in silence. Ted smiled at Harry, and Harry smiled back. They were sure that for once they had beaten Gavin. They reached the school gates. Still Gavin said nothing. \\"We've won,\\" Ted said to Harry, but he spoke too soon. On the way home, Gavin said, \\"My Dad is so clean that he doesn't have to bathe at all.\\" 1. What does it say children on the playground are always doing? Numbered answers:","output":"1. The article states that children on the playground are always boasting. They often make different kind of claims, particularly about their families. For example, who has the bigger car, or whose mother is smarter. Harry, Ted, and Gavin, the three little boys mentioned, were no exception. They were always engaged in such boasting, with Gavin being noted as the worst since all things about his family were reportedly always the 'best', 'biggest', or the 'most expensive'. 2. It explains that in their display of playful competitiveness, these kids continually tried to outdo each other. Thus, whatever one kid said, another would attempt to downplay that by stating something about their family which was allegedly better or superior. This underscores the relentless nature of their boasting in the playground, as the desire to emerge as the 'winner' in these exchanges was a dominant theme evident in their interactions. 3. At one point, the boasting involved how often their respective fathers bathed. Harry's father bathed twice a week and Ted's father took a bath every day—sometimes twice a day. This put Gavin in a challenging position because he couldn't outdo Ted's argument without sounding ridiculous. The two boys thought they had finally gotten the upper hand over Gavin. However, Gavin surprised them later by saying that his Dad was so clean that he didn't need to bathe at all. 4. Gavin's silence at the school gates initially gave a sense of victory to Ted and Harry. Nevertheless, his later claim demonstrated that the boasting was not limited to school or playground. In essence, the habitual bragging observed in the children extended their interactions beyond the playground and was carried into different aspects of their daily lives.  In summary, the article explains that young children on the playground are always in a state of friendly competition, incessantly boasting about their families in various ways to support their claims of superiority."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Question: \\"After Esquival arrived, did the Spanish remain in Nueva Sevilla?\\" Response: \\"No, they moved from Nueva Sevilla to Villa de la Vega due to mosquitoes and unhealthy conditions\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question."},{"instruction":"Title: truth in reviewing Review: I'll get right to my point.

And if you hate spiders already, then this video of the unusual critter is sure to be your worst nightmare. The footage shows a yellowish arachnid with unusual black markings all over its body, but that's far from the weirdest thing about the bizarre spider. In the video, it's possible to see the spider's retinas moving around inside its jelly-like head, before the beady orange eyes eventually fix on the camera. As the spider susses out its surroundings, it makes freaky jerking movements, prompting some viewers to suggest the creature is not from this planet. The moving retinas and shifty movements were enough to seriously spook commenters on YouTube, where the video was first shared. One likened the creature to an \\"alien\\", whilst the Star reports that one viewer claimed they would \\"never sleep at night\\" if they came across one of the critters in their house. And another spooked viewer said: \\"I can see it thinking\\" As out-of-this-world as the spider may seem, it turns out that the creature is indeed native to this planet, and is an Ecuadorian breed of jumping spider. Jumping spiders are believed to be one of the most intelligent breeds of spider, and have been known to watch and stalk their prey for hours before striking. This isn't the first time we've all be stunned by an unusual spider however, and you can be sure that it won't be the last. Earlier this year, we revealed that Britain may have been invaded by a breed of spider whose bite will give victims a painful, four-hour long erection, before killing them. Recently, a giant huntsman spider sent shivers down our spines, after the huge critter was filmed clutching a dead mouse and dragging it back to its lair.","output":"A video posted on YouTube claiming to show an alien spider with a translucent head has frightened viewers, some of whom deemed it an extraterrestrial creature.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine.

Personnel has been sending him options.\\" However, State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told ABC News that the State Department hires political appointees through a \\"variety of avenues\\". \\"State Department officials are regularly in touch with a range of outside individuals and organisations including non-profits, NGOs, think tanks, and others,\\" she said. Mrs Clinton's campaign addressed the emails highlighted by Judicial Watch, suggesting that Mr Band was acting as former President Bill Clinton's personal assistant and not in his role as the head of the Clinton Global Initiative. \\"They are communications between her aides and the president's personal aide, and indeed the recommendation was for one of the Secretary's former staffers who was not employed by the foundation,\\" a statement said. Why they hate Hillary in Trump country Are the Democrats too confident? Three reasons Hillary could lose In another instance, Mr Band asked Ms Abedin and Ms Mills to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire, Gilbert Chagoury, in contact with the State Department's \\"substance person\\" on Lebanon. Mr Band said the billionaire foundation donor was a \\"key guy there [Lebanon] and to us\\". The newly released batch also included an email to Mrs Clinton from Stephen Roach, then-chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, who said he was scheduled to testify to Congress and was \\"happy to help in any way I can.\\" Mr Roach then met with Mrs Clinton over the summer for 30 minutes, according to Clinton calendars obtained by the AP. Mrs Clinton's campaign did not immediately address the email exchange with Mr Roach. The Democratic nominee has been mired in controversy over her use of a personal email server while at the State Department, prompting a federal investigation and undermining her trustworthiness among public opinion. FBI Director James Comey announced in July that though Mrs Clinton was \\"extremely careless,\\" his investigation did not find any evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Republican presidential rival Donald Trump's campaign responded to the latest revelations, saying it was \\"more evidence that Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, character, stability and temperament to be within 1,000 miles of public power\\". Summary:","output":"In a new batch of unreleased emails obtained by conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, it has been revealed that a Clinton Foundation official asked for help in finding a job for a foundation associate within Hilary Clinton's Department of State. Clinton's campaign has addressed these emails, stating that the communications were between her aides and the aides of then-president, Bill Clinton, also suggesting that the recommended employee was a former staffer of the Secretary who was not employed by the foundation. Clinton has faced criticism for using a personal email server during her time at the State Department, and although the FBI investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the issue has tarnished her standing in public opinion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Batista Dictatorship of Cuba established the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two unmasked gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio at gunpoint. The motive was simple: By capturing the biggest name in motorsport the rebels were showing up the government and attracting worldwide publicity to their cause. But despite the shocking news spreading across the globe, President Batista would not be outdone and ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers.  Fangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: \\"Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.\\" Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards.  The captors motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. After Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans were convinced that Batista was losing his power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution concluded in January 1959, cancelling the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, Operacion Fangio.

We can do this by following these steps: Step 1: Add 615905 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant on the left side. 421 * y - 615905 + 615905 = -628535 + 615905 Simplifying, we get: 421 * y = -12630 Step 2: Now, we need to get y by itself. To do this, we must divide both sides of the equation by 421. (421 * y) / 421 = -12630 / 421 Since 421 / 421 = 1, we have: y = -12630 / 421 Step 3: Simplify the fraction on the right side of the equation. y ≈ -12630 / 421 ≈ -30 So, the solution to the given equation is y ≈ -30."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To simplify the equation, we can sum these terms. -415215*m + 415141*m = (-415215 + 415141)*m = -74*m So the equation becomes: 0 = -74*m + 296 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'm' In order to solve the equation for 'm', we want to isolate 'm' on one side. To do this, we can subtract 296 from both sides. 0 - 296 = -74*m + 296 - 296 -296 = -74*m Step 3: Solve for 'm' We now have a simpler equation: -296 = -74*m To find the value of m, we can divide both sides by -74: (-296) / (-74) = (-74*m) / (-74) 4 = m So, the value of m that solves the equation is m = 4."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

The nail was apparently named after the practice of hammering brass nails into the counter at shops where cloth was sold . On the other hand , R D Connor , in The weights and measures of England ( p 84 ) states that the nail was the 16th part of a Roman foot , i.e. , digitus or finger , although he provides no reference to support this . Zupko 's A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles ( p 256 ) states that the nail was originally the distance from the thumbnail to the joint at the base of the thumb , or alternately , from the end of the middle finger to the second joint . An archaic usage of the term nail is as a sixteenth of a ( long ) hundredweight for mass , or 1 clove of 7 pound avoirdupois ( 3.175 kg ) .  - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness.  - An inch (abbreviation: in or ) is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to yard but usually understood as of a foot. Derived from the Roman uncia (\\"twelfth\\"), \\"inch\\" is also sometimes used to translate related units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb. Traditional standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s it has been based on the metric system and reckoned as exactly 2.54cm. Name. The English word \\"inch\\" was an early borrowing from Latin \\"\\" (\\"one-twelfth; Roman inch; Roman ounce\\") not present in other Germanic languages. The vowel change from Latin /u/ to English // is known as umlaut. The consonant change from the Latin /k/ to English /t/ or // is palatalisation. Both were features of Old English phonology. \\"Inch\\" is cognate with \\"ounce\\", whose separate pronunciation and spelling reflect its reborrowing in Middle English from Anglo-Norman \\"unce\\" and \\"ounce\\".  - A yardstick is a straightedge used to physically measure lengths of up to a yard (0.9144 metres or three feet) high. Yardsticks are flat wooden boards with markings at regular intervals.  - The yard (abbreviation: yd) is an English unit of length, in both the British imperial and US customary systems of measurement, that comprises 3 feet or 36 inches. It is by international agreement in 1959 standardized as exactly 0.9144 meters. A metal yardstick originally formed the physical standard from which all other units of length were officially derived in both English systems.    What is the relationship between 'nail ' and 'unit of length'? A:","output":"The relationship between 'nail' and 'unit of length' lies in the fact that a 'nail' refers to a specific unit of length that was historically used for measuring cloth and certain weights and measures. This term has its origins in the old practice of hammering brass nails into the counter at shops where cloth was sold, as a system of measuring cloth. The nail as a unit of cloth measurement is generally considered a sixteenth of a yard or 2.25 inches (5.715 cm). There are alternative theories about the origins of the term 'nail,' such as R.D. Connor's suggestion that it was the 16th part of a Roman foot, or Zupko's proposal that it was originally the distance from the thumbnail to the joint at the base of the thumb, or from the end of the middle finger to the second joint. In a different context, an archaic usage of the term 'nail' refers to a sixteenth of a (long) hundredweight for mass, or 1 clove of 7-pound avoirdupois (3.175 kg).  In the context of geometric measurements related to length, the yard, foot, inch, and subsequently the nail are units used to measure objects in the British imperial and US customary systems. These units, including the nail, provide ways to quantify the size of items based on a consistent standard, which is essential for commerce and daily life. Therefore, the relationship between 'nail' and 'unit of length' signifies the historical usage and the practical application of the term 'nail' as a means of measuring length and distance in certain domains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Rod Bristow said Edexcel's maths and economics exams had been overshadowed by concerns that content had been available beforehand. Some of an economics exam appeared on social media and a maths paper was apparently for sale online. Police arrested and released two men pending further inquiries in the case. The alleged leaks prompted angry responses from teachers' and head teachers' leaders, who said this year's exams had been \\"plagued\\" with problems. Pearson, which owns Edexcel, said the sale of maths exam papers had been confirmed on Friday. But Pearson chief executive Mr Bristow said this was \\"too late to replace papers to be sat that day and the following Monday\\". \\"We notified the exams regulator Ofqual and took the evidence we had gathered to the police, who immediately began their investigations. \\"The police rapidly made arrests, but their detailed investigation takes time, and we had to make a decision about how to approach the exams that students still had to sit,\\" said Mr Bristow. \\"In any situation like this we have well-established contingency plans that adhere to one over-riding principle - fairness for all students. \\"We have to ensure that the exams are secure, and that we will be able to mark papers to ensure fair results. \\"If we had had any reason to believe that there had been a widespread breach of the maths papers, we would have postponed this week's sittings without hesitation.\\" As the police had suggested the problem was localised, the board decided to issue replacement exam questions for the papers to be sat in the small number of schools and colleges thought to be affected.

Paragraph: After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

Which county is using a unit mesured with millimeter, Germany or United States?  Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm.

This significant development is just another hurdle for the team as they try to recover from a series of setbacks and disappointing performances. Step 1: Establish the context for the surgery The season has been challenging for the Athletics, with numerous injuries plaguing the roster and adversely affecting team performance. Recently, it was announced that Anderson will be out for an extended period of time following a successful Tommy John surgery to repair his injured elbow. The decision to undergo surgery was made after Anderson consulted with team doctors and specialists and determined that it was the best course of action to ensure a full recovery and return to his previous form. Step 2: Explain the impact of the surgery on the team Brett Anderson's absence from the Athletics' pitching rotation due to the surgery will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the team's performance down the stretch. Anderson was considered a cornerstone of the rotation, and his absence leaves a glaring hole that will need to be filled by inexperienced or underperforming pitchers on the roster. Furthermore, the prolonged recovery period for Tommy John surgery can be as long as 12-18 months, which means that Anderson may not be available to contribute to the team until late next season, at the earliest. Step 3: Mention potential replacements for Anderson While it is impossible to replace a talent like Brett Anderson, the Athletics will need to explore potential roster changes to offset the loss. Some options include internal promotions from their minor league teams, signing available free agents, or exploring trades with other clubs. Some possible candidates for promotion from within the organization include Jesús Luzardo and Daulton Jefferies, both promising young pitchers who have displayed impressive performances in the minor leagues. Step 4: Discuss the long-term implications for the Athletics and Anderson The Tommy John surgery is undoubtedly a significant setback for both the Athletics and Brett Anderson. While there is a high success rate for pitchers returning from the procedure, there are no guarantees, and the long recovery process will be critical for Anderson to regain his former prowess on the mound. For the Athletics, Anderson's injury serves as a stark reminder of how quickly a team's fortunes can change due to unforeseen circumstances. Moving forward, management must carefully evaluate their roster depth and develop contingency plans to better adapt to such changes and setbacks in the future. Conclusion: Despite the surge of adversity, the Oakland Athletics remain optimistic and are committed to overcoming their challenges to field a competitive team. The loss of Brett Anderson to Tommy John surgery is undoubtedly a significant blow, but the organization has weathered such storms before. The true test for the Athletics will be their ability to adapt, learn and grow from this experience, ultimately emerging as a stronger and more resilient team in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But years later they ruptured leaving her with painful, lopsided breasts.","output":"Title: The Importance of Researching Your Choices Once upon a time, there was a lady named Susan Calvert. Susan was worried because she thought her chest looked more like a boy's - it was not as big as she wanted it to be. So, she decided to change that by getting an operation to make her chest bigger. This operation is called \\"breast augmentation.\\" Sometimes, we need to stop and think about things before we do them. That is called \\"research.\\" Research helps us know more about stuff, so we can make good choices. But Susan, in a hurry, didn't do her research before the operation. She just wanted her chest to look bigger, quickly. Susan met a doctor who said he could make her chest bigger with something called \\"implants.\\" Implants are like soft, squishy balloons filled with a special gel. The doctor put them inside Susan's chest to make her boobs look bigger. The doctor told Susan that her implants would last forever, just like toys that never break! However, after some years, something bad happened. The implants broke (like balloons popping) and Susan's chest started to hurt. Her boobs didn't look nice anymore - they were uneven, like one shoe being smaller than the other. Susan was really sad and wished she had done her research before getting the operation. So, the important lesson in Susan's story is to always do your research. It's good to learn about things before we make decisions. If we don't take the time to research and think about what we want to do, we might end up like Susan, with a painful and unhappy experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"UK inflation rate fell to 0% in February, the lowest since records began, official figures show.\\"","output":"Title: Record-Breaking 0% Inflation Rate in UK: A Closer Look at February's Remarkable Figures Introduction In the financial world, February emerged as a historic month when the United Kingdom recorded a zero percent inflation rate, the lowest since records began. As we delve into understanding the official figures and analysing the potential implications of this record-breaking inflation rate, one must begin at the source: understanding the role of inflation as an essential element of a country's financial wellbeing. Understanding Inflation Inflation is the rate at which the price of goods and services rises over time. Central banks, including the Bank of England, closely monitor inflation to ensure economic stability. A high inflation rate signifies rising costs for consumers, whereas a low inflation rate or deflation usually indicates weak consumer demand and a sluggish economy. In a healthy economy, a small and consistent level of inflation is typical, ensuring that businesses can raise prices and wages without causing huge disruptions to financial markets. The Current UK Economy Amid the unprecedented challenges of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK has faced significant economic headwinds. In February, the inflation rate dropped to zero percent, marking the lowest level ever recorded since the inception of official records. This was, in part, due to a drop in energy, fuel, and clothing costs. The sudden decrease in inflation can also be attributed to the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme, which is aimed at injecting liquidity into the economy during turbulent times. Analysing the Factors Behind the 0% Inflation Rate 1. Energy Prices: As the world continues to combat climate change and gravitate towards environmentally-friendly energy sources, the prices of fossil fuels have dropped. The reduced global demand for energy during the pandemic has also led to market oversupply, causing a downward pressure on energy prices. 2. Lower Fuel Costs: Alongside energy costs, the decrease in fuel prices played a vital role in the UK's plummeting inflation. With COVID-19 restrictions in place and limited opportunities for travel, overall demand for fuel dropped, contributing to reduced prices. 3. Clothing and Footwear: Businesses in the fashion industry have experienced reduced sales volumes due to the pandemic, leading to discounts and sales promotions to incentivise consumers to spend. This, in turn, has caused prices in clothing and footwear to decrease, creating deflationary pressure. 4. Import Prices: An appreciating pound sterling has reduced import costs, allowing domestic UK businesses to obtain goods at lower prices. Imported goods such as food items, essential consumer items, and intermediate goods have consequently become more affordable, leading to a drop in overall prices across the UK. The Implications of a 0% Inflation Rate While a zero percent inflation rate may initially appear to be a positive phenomenon, allowing consumers to purchase goods and services at consistent prices, there are long-term risks involved. 1. Consumers may delay purchases, expecting further decreases in prices, which could reduce demand, leading to unemployment and business closures. 2. Inflation rates near zero make it difficult for the Bank of England to use conventional monetary policy tools, such as adjusting interest rates, to stimulate economic activity. 3. A prolonged period of near-zero inflation or deflation may lead to increased debt burdens on households and businesses, as debt repayments become a larger proportion of income when prices are falling. Conclusion The record-breaking zero percent inflation rate in February signals the UK's continued struggle to maintain economic stability in the face of challenging global circumstances. As the government and central bank devise strategies to address the risk of deflation and economic stagnation, it remains crucial to address the underlying factors contributing to the country's weakened economic performance. Through targeted economic policies and collaborative efforts with other nations, the UK can move towards restoring a healthy level of inflation that supports its economic recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1]  Paragraph: On March 2015 Japans economy soared. There was a likelihood that the Japanese yen would rise in value. In the wake of this event, Japanese Government adjusted  the price of Japanese Currency Yen in accordance with the going market price. On the other hand, at he same time, UK was having economic downturn. There was a likelihood that the UK Currency Pound Sterling would go down. Fearing public backlash, UK Government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which currency would most likely be exchanged in the black market, Pound Sterling or Yen? Answer:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the Pound Sterling would most likely be exchanged in the black market. This is due to the government's decision to keep the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level despite the economic downturn, which likely made the official exchange rate inconsistent with the market value. In such situations, black markets often emerge for the undervalued currency (the Pound Sterling in this case), as people will be looking to exchange at a rate that is closer to the real market value rather than the artificially maintained official rate. In contrast, the Japanese yen, whose price was adjusted in accordance with the going market price, would be less likely to be the subject of black market trades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As the mosque debate dominates the summer spin cycle, a new Pew Research Poll shows that an increasing number of Americans believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim -- now up to 18 percent from 11 percent in March 2009. At the same time, only a third of Americans say Obama is a Christian, down from nearly 50 percent last year. And while the biggest jumps in believing Obama is Muslim come from self-described conservative Republicans -- from 18 percent to 34 percent -- the number of Democrats who describe Obama as Christian fell from 55 percent to 46 percent. Independents -- while being the group least likely to want professions of religious beliefs from politicians -- have also fallen in with the drift. The birther myths build off this sense of Obama as a sinister fraud, casting","output":"doubt on not only his religious beliefs but also his citizenship and legitimacy as the President of the United States. These claims have been fueled by conspiracy theories and mistruths spread across the internet and social media, as well as by some political commentators and public figures who have given credence to the falsehoods. Despite consistently providing evidence that he was indeed born in Hawaii and debunking the \\"birther\\" conspiracy theories, Obama still faced an uphill battle to prove his Americanness to the public. His Kenyan heritage, unique name, and diverse upbringing have contributed to building a perception among some Americans that he is alien and unfamiliar. As the mosque debate intensified during the summer, it only served to deepen the divisions over Obama's religious beliefs and cultural background. However, on September 1, 2010, the White House answered public concerns by issuing a brief statement in which President Obama directly confronted the issue. \\"I am an American, and I am a Christian. I have a deep respect for the Islamic faith, but it is important for everyone to understand that these rumors about my religion are false. My faith is rooted in Christianity and the teachings of Jesus Christ,\\" he stated. The President's statement generated mixed reactions, with some political analysts arguing that it was a necessary step to quell the rumors and squash the conspiracies about Obama's background, while others expressed concerns that the statement validated the false claims and hate speech that had been circulating about him for quite some time. In an effort to promote unity and understanding, the Obama administration launched a series of interfaith dialogues and events aimed at fostering a deeper appreciation for diversity and combatting religious discrimination. These efforts were met with varying degrees of success, but they laid the groundwork for a broader discussion about the role of religion and religious identity in American politics and society. Over time, the number of people who believed that President Obama was a Muslim gradually decreased as more information about his faith and background became widely available. However, the lingering doubts and conspiracy theories revealed a deep undercurrent of mistrust and misunderstanding among the American public that would take years to repair. In the long run, the mosque debate and the controversy surrounding President Obama's religious beliefs underscored the growing influence of misinformation and conspiracy theories in shaping public opinion, as well as the importance of promoting tolerance, understanding, and the democratic values that America was founded upon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I recently read a piece about a guy in his late 30s who took up learning guitar as a hobby and actually became a proficient player. Then I read about a young man who decided to devote an hour a day learning about something just for fun — including banjo, juggling and astrophysics. Those pieces revved me up to go out and learn something new. Although I love that journalism allows me to dabble in a range of topics, I miss the thrill of structured, focused education. Im not talking about going back to school full-time for a degree program, but taking a course or even reading a book to learn something just for the sake of it, such as a new language or skill. (Italian! Guitar! Indian cooking!) I dont need to become a master–the basics are fine with me. Easier said than done, of course. The problem isn’t just that my aging brain makes it harder to absorb new information. It’s squeezing in the time. But when you think about it, a dedicated hour or even half-hour a day isnt that hard to fit in; I surely accumulate that much time watching TV, reading, exercising or futzing round the house. Maybe I could listen to an instructional tape while jogging? Or read some educational nonfiction before bed instead of my go-to novels or mysteries? Or take a web course instead of vegging out to Modern Family? Despite my gung-ho intentions to learn, I have a feeling that I may simply be too undisciplined–and tired–at the end of the day to make this happen at this young-kid stage of my life. It’s not just me, either. My husband recently signed up for Rosetta Stone to learn Brazilian Portuguese. His initial enthusiasm has now waned and while he still wants to complete the course, work, family and sleep needs have made it tough to master.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many theories exist to explain the origin of the 260-day count?","output":"Title: Exploring the Theories Behind the Origin of the 260-Day Count Introduction The 260-day count, known as the Tzolkin, holds a significant place in the Mesoamerican ancient calendrical systems. This count was followed primarily by the Maya, Zapotec, and other Mesoamerican civilizations. The enigmatic origin of the 260-day count has been subject to numerous debates among archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians. Several theories strive to explain the reason behind the choice of 260 days and the overall significance of this calendar cycle. In this article, we delve into the various theories to better understand why the Tzolkin was such an important part of the Mesoamerican cultures. The Divine Creation Theory  One perspective argues that the 260-day count originates from divine creation, with the days representing the time it took the gods to develop the world. According to Mesoamerican mythology, the gods created the Earth and the Tzolkin calendar. Since it's justifiable to believe that no time elapsed before the creation, the calendar had to start with day one (1 Imix in the Maya calendar). As the 260-day cycle ends, the count restarts again, signifying the cyclical nature of life and the continuing divine connection to the gods.  The Astronomical Theory The astronomical theory is perhaps the most dominant explanation, attributing the origin of the 260-day count to celestial phenomena. Since ancient Mesoamerican cultures were deeply engrossed in the study of the skies, they closely monitored the movements of celestial bodies. In this context, the Tzolkin might have played an integral role as a means to predict eclipses, solstices, equinoxes, and planetary alignments. Certain astronomical phenomena, such as the synodic period of Venus, Mars, and other planets, are believed to be connected to the 260-day cycle. For instance, the synodic period of Venus is approximately 584 days, while that of Mars is 780 days. Interestingly, when their synodic periods are at their closest conjunction, they harmonize with the Tzolkin at 260 x 3 = 780 days. The Agricultural Theory Another well-known theory posits that the origin of the 260-day calendar is found in agricultural cycles. Mesoamerican peoples were largely dependent on agriculture for their subsistence, which could be the reason for developing a calendar synchronized with the natural world. The primary agricultural crop cultivated by these civilizations was maize, which played a crucial role in their culture as it was considered a sacred entity. The growing period for maize coincides with the length of the Tzolkin cycle in different ways, depending on the region. For example, in highland Oaxaca, the planting season spans about 260 days, while in some highland Maya areas, the agricultural cycle is 2 x 260 days. This connection could explain the cultural significance attached to the Tzolkin. The Human Gestation Theory The human gestation theory associates the 260-day count with the average duration of human pregnancy, which is about 266 days or approximately nine months. Ancient Mesoamerican societies highly valued fertility, childbirth, and the bonds between generations. Therefore, they might have created a calendar cycle that resonated with the gestational period and symbolized the link between life, time, and continuity. In Maya culture, there is evidence of art and rituals celebrating fertility and childbirth. A connection between the 260-day calendar and human gestation would serve as an important reminder of the perpetuity of life and the essential role women played in the creation and maintenance of life. Conclusion While numerous theories have been proposed to explain the origin of the 260-day count, uncertainty prevails, as no single theory has been established as definitive. However, these theories elucidate the complexity and sophistication of the ancient Mesoamerican cultures and their deep connection to the natural world, spirituality, and cosmos. As research into this field progresses, it is only a matter of time before more insights are discovered that may shed further light on the enigma that is the 260-day count."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who plays John? Title: Halloween H20: 20 Years Later Movie plot: On October 29, 1998, Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), Dr. Sam Loomis' former colleague, returns to her home in Langdon, Illinois, to find it has been burglarized. After having her neighbor Jimmy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his friend Tony call the police, Jimmy searches the house and finds nothing. While waiting for the police, Marion discovers a file is missing, the one on Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Michael Myers' sister. She also realizes that someone has been in her house and immediately rushes back over to Jimmy's house, where she finds him and Tony dead. Michael Myers (Chris Durand) appears, and kills Marion. Michael leaves the house with Laurie's file. On Halloween, two days later, Laurie Strode awakens from a nightmare, having to be calmed by her son, John (Josh Hartnett). Since 1978, she has tried to get her life together with the hope that her older brother would never come after her again. She faked her death in a car accident, and then relocated to California under the assumed name \\"Keri Tate\\". She has a seemingly perfect life with John, her boyfriend Will (Adam Arkin), and a career as headmistress at Hillcrest Academy, a private boarding school where John attends. Unfortunately, Laurie is far from happy, as the tragic events from 1978 still haunt her. While a woman and her daughter are using a bathroom at a rest stop, the two narrowly avoid Michael, who steals the woman's car. At the campus, the students leave for an overnight field trip at the Yosemite National Park. Later that evening, John and his friends are having an intimate Halloween party in the basement when John's friend, Charlie (Adam Hann-Byrd), is attacked and killed by Michael. When Charlie's girlfriend Sarah (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) goes looking for him, she finds him dead in the kitchen dumbwaiter with a corkscrew embedded in his throat, and Michael appears.

They both convey that thanks to the Facebook generation, anyone can become a Kevin Spacey or a Harvey Weinstein by simply using a selfie.

In the second statement: \\"Thanks to the Facebook generation, by simply attaching a selfie, anyone can become a Kevin Spacey or a Harvey Weinstein,\\" he added. Both statements express the same idea, even though there are minor differences in wording. The first version uses \\"installing a Selfie\\" while the second version uses \\"attaching a selfie.\\" It is worth noting that the term \\"attaching a selfie\\" is more accurate because \\"installing a Selfie\\" might imply installing an application.

Answer:","output":"The current name of the city, whose previous name is the same as the movie featuring the song \\"Humma Humma,\\" is Mumbai. The song \\"Humma Humma\\" is from the Bollywood film \\"Bombay\\" released in 1995. The city of Bombay was officially renamed as Mumbai in 1995 due to political changes and to honor the local Marathi culture. Mumbai, which is the capital city of Maharashtra, is the most populous city in India and holds significant importance economically, commercially, and culturally. It is also known as the financial capital of the country, with major institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, and the National Stock Exchange of India being headquartered in the city. Mumbai's rich history dates back several centuries, with evidence of various dynasties ruling the region. The city got its name from the local deity \\"Mumba Devi.\\" It witnessed control of several empires throughout history, such as the Maurya Empire, the Gupta Empire, and the Rashtrakuta dynasty, to name a few. The city started gaining prominence during the 16th century when the Portuguese took control of the area and named it \\"Bombaim,\\" meaning \\"Good Bay.\\" Later, as part of the dowry, the city was handed over to the British Empire in 1661. The British anglicized the name to \\"Bombay,\\" and it became a significant trading and administrative hub during the British Raj in India. As mentioned earlier, the city was officially renamed Mumbai in 1995, following political changes and a demand by the right-wing party Shiv Sena to emphasize the local Marathi culture. Additionally, the renaming was aimed at undoing the English influence on the regional names, reflecting the postcolonial identity of India. In conclusion, the current name of the city, whose previous name is the same as the movie featuring the song \\"Humma Humma,\\" is Mumbai. This movie is the Bollywood blockbuster \\"Bombay\\" from 1995. The city's name changed from Bombay to Mumbai that same year to reflect the Marathi culture and national identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The pair secured amendments to protect and compensate union whistleblowers while also obtaining an undertaking from the government to extend the same protections - or stronger ones - to whistleblowers in the corporate and public sectors. A parliamentary inquiry will examine the whistleblower protections in the legislation and if it recommends a stronger regime for corporate and public sector whistleblowers, the government will establish an expert advisory panel to draft legislation to implement those reforms. The legislation needs to be introduced by December 2017 and dealt with no later than June 30, 2018, according to the undertaking.

To answer this question, I will perform the following steps: 1. Define 'tuxedo' and 'suit.' 2. Compare their characteristics and purposes. Step 1: Define 'tuxedo' and 'suit.' A tuxedo is a type of formal attire worn by men, mainly for evening events and black-tie occasions. It typically consists of a black or midnight blue jacket, formal trousers, a waistcoat or cummerbund, and a black bow tie. A suit, on the other hand, is a more versatile attire worn by men for various occasions, including business meetings, weddings, and casual events. It usually comprises a matching jacket and trousers, a collared shirt, and a tie. Step 2: Compare their characteristics and purposes. There are several differences between a tuxedo and a suit: 1. Fabric: Tuxedos often use high-quality, lustrous fabrics like satin or silk on the lapels, buttons, and side stripes of trousers. Suits tend to have more subtle fabrics and typically do not feature these contrasting materials. 2. Lapels: Tuxedo jackets generally have peak or shawl lapels, while suits can have peak, notch, or shawl lapels. 3. Trouser stripes: Tuxedo pants typically have a satin or silk stripe running down the outside leg seam, while suit pants do not. 4. Waist covering: Tuxedos are worn with a waistcoat or a cummerbund, while suits often have a belt or, sometimes, suspenders. 5. Shirt and ties: Tuxedos are generally worn with a wing or turn-down collar shirt and a black bow tie, while suits are worn with a collared shirt and a long tie. 6. Occasion: Tuxedos are specifically designed for formal occasions, while suits can be worn for a range of events from casual to formal.

Question: Question: If your trouser fly is unfastened what should you do? Options: - do up - tie up - zip up - pick up - button up  Explain why a human would choose \\"zip up\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"zip up\\" to answer the question above for several reasons. Here's the step-by-step justification for that choice: 1. Understand the context: The context of the question is referring to a trouser fly, which is the opening in the front of a pair of trousers that allows for ease of dressing and using the restroom. This context helps narrow down the appropriate response. 2. Analyze the options:    a. 'do up' - This phrase is ambiguous and could refer to various actions, such as doing up one's hair or dressing up. It doesn't specifically address the issue of an unfastened trouser fly.    b. 'tie up' - Tying up refers to using a knot, like with shoelaces or a ribbon. Most trouser flies have either a zipper or buttons, so this option doesn't apply.    c. 'zip up' - This phrase directly addresses the problem of the unfastened trouser fly. Many trousers have zippers that need to be zipped up in order to fasten the fly securely. This option is the most accurate and relevant to the situation.    d. 'pick up' - This phrase refers to lifting something up or collecting items, and doesn't relate to the context of fastening a trouser fly.    e. 'button up' - While this option seems relevant, as some trousers have buttoned flies, it is less common than zippers, and \\"zip up\\" is the better choice for a general response. 3. Choose the most appropriate option: Based on the analysis, \\"zip up\\" is the most accurate and relevant choice as it directly addresses the issue of an unfastened trouser fly in the vast majority of cases. Therefore, a human would choose \\"zip up\\" as the answer because it is the option that best addresses the specific issue of an unfastened trouser fly, and is the most common solution across different types of trousers."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information:  - Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or  ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille.

Wesleyan University officials announced Monday that residential fraternities will be required to accept women and men as full members. The policy change comes after consulting fraternity members, alumni and faculty, university spokesperson Kate Carlisle said. There are nonresidential Greek organizations, including one sorority, that will not be affected because they do not have on-campus houses. \\"In the end, the decision is based on making our campus as fair, inclusive and equitable as possible, and reflects Wesleyan's tradition of progressive leadership,\\" Carlisle said. Wesleyan's board of trustees asked President Michael S. Roth in May to \\"prepare a plan to address the future of Greek life\\" after \\"highly publicized incidents of sexual violence.\\" In a March 2014 lawsuit against Wesleyan's Xi Chapter of Psi Upsilon, a then-freshman student alleged she was raped in front of onlookers at the fraternity's on-campus residence. An April 2014 Wesleyan Student Assembly survey that found 47% of respondents felt less safe in fraternity spaces also contributed to the review, Roth said in a statement. \\"The trustees and administration recognize that residential fraternities have contributed greatly to Wesleyan over a long period of time, but we also believe they must change to continue to benefit their members and the larger campus community,\\" Roth and Joshua Boger, the chair of the university's board of trustees, wrote in a joint statement on Monday. The fraternities have three years to complete the co-educational transition.

Keeping to a daily routine was easier for Monica than Victoria because  Select from the following. a). Monica had good self discipline.. b). Victoria had good self discipline..","output":"Keeping to a daily routine was easier for Monica than Victoria because Monica had good self-discipline, which allowed her to create a structured schedule and adhere to it consistently. This self-discipline played a significant role in Monica's ability to maintain her daily routine, as she had developed habits and behaviors that supported her goals and helped her stay organized and focused throughout the day. Monica's self-discipline manifested in various ways that were essential to her successfully maintaining a daily routine. She had a strong sense of time management, ensuring that she allocated proper time to her work and personal tasks without allowing one area to overwhelm the other. Monica's determination and dedication to her routine were also apparent, as she would prioritize her daily tasks without getting easily distracted by external factors or procrastination. In contrast, Victoria struggled to keep a daily routine, as she did not possess the same level of self-discipline as Monica. While Victoria may have had some structure to her day, her lack of self-discipline often led her to spend time on tasks that were not essential or to procrastinate, losing sight of her priorities. This tendency to be more lax with her daily schedule resulted in her struggling to maintain consistency, causing her to often fall behind on work or personal goals. Moreover, Monica's self-discipline extended to other areas of her life as well. She maintained a healthy diet and exercise routine, knowing that these habits contributed positively to her overall well-being and productivity. By prioritizing her health and well-being, Monica was better equipped to stay focused and engaged with her daily tasks, further solidifying her ability to consistently adhere to her routine. Victoria, on the other hand, may not have placed the same emphasis on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which could have impeded her ability to stick to her daily routine. Without the energy and motivation derived from a balanced diet and regular exercise, she may have felt more lethargic and less motivated to complete her daily tasks, making it challenging to maintain a consistent routine. In summary, keeping to a daily routine was easier for Monica than Victoria because Monica had good self-discipline which enabled her to effectively manage her time, prioritize her tasks and maintain a healthy lifestyle. This discipline allowed Monica to stay focused, organized, and consistent in her daily routine, while Victoria's lack of self-discipline resulted in her struggling to uphold the same level of consistency in her daily life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was on the Mexican supply train Bowie attacked on November 26?  By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition... A:","output":"The Mexican supply train that Bowie attacked on November 26 was discovered to be carrying only grass used for feeding horses. The train was initially alleged to be carrying a payroll, thus the attack was intended to disrupt Mexican forces resources. However, once the contents of the train were discovered, the skirmish was famously christened \\"the Grass Fight\\". So, despite the initial belief that the train was carrying monetary supplies, it turned out that the cargo was purely animal fodder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: who played michael myers in the rob zombie halloween movie?","output":"In the Rob Zombie-directed Halloween movies, the character of Michael Myers was primarily portrayed by Tyler Mane.  Tyler Mane, born Daryl Karolat, is a Canadian actor and former professional wrestler. He stands at an imposing height of 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m), which made him an imposing figure for the role of the infamous killer, Michael Myers. Prior to his role in the Halloween remakes, Tyler Mane was known for his work as a professional wrestler and for portraying Sabretooth in the 2000 film X-Men. Rob Zombie, a musician, filmmaker, and screenwriter, reimagined the classic Halloween slasher films, originally directed by John Carpenter, in two films released in 2007 and 2009. The first movie, titled Halloween (2007), is a partial remake and partial reimagining of the 1978 original film. The story explores the origins of the character Michael Myers and delves into his childhood, providing a deeper understanding of the character's motives. The second film, Halloween II (2009), is a direct sequel to Zombie's 2007 film and provides a unique take on the story, further developing the saga of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. In both of these films, Tyler Mane brings a terrifying physical presence to the role of the masked serial killer. Though Tyler Mane's portrayal of Michael Myers was well-received by many horror fans, there were others who found the reinterpretation of the classic character to be too different from the original depiction by Nick Castle in John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). Consequently, the Rob Zombie-directed Halloween films have been met with mixed reviews from both fans and critics. Despite the mixed reception, Tyler Mane's portrayal as Michael Myers remains an integral part of the Halloween franchise and the character's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It would start with a howling noise from a senior football player at Sayreville War Memorial High School, and then the locker room lights were abruptly shut off.            In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen. Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth.            This disturbing hazing within the storied Sayreville football program, as told to NJ Advance Media on Wednesday by the parent of a player in the program, happened almost every day in the locker room this fall, he said.      The allegations — revealed for the first time — provide details to the events that sparked a criminal investigation by local and county police, and prompted the cancellation of the remainder of the Sayreville football season this week by Superintendent of Schools Richard Labbe.      The parent, informed by his son and other parents close to the investigation, is the first to come forward to reveal the hazing practices Labbe has characterized as “incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying as constituted by the definition within the anti-bullying statute that took place on a pervasive level, on a wide-scale level, and at a level in which the players knew, tolerated, and in general accepted.”      According to the parent, whose identity is being protected because the parent feared retribution against the family and the player, the routine was initiated when an upperclassman would enter the locker room and make a wolf call or howling noise.      “[For] 10 seconds, the lights would go off and they would grab a freshman and they would go on,” the parent said. “Right on the floor. … It was happening every day. They would get the freshmen.”      He added: “Kids would just sit around and witness [stuff] like this.”            Detectives from the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office and the Sayreville Police Department are investigating the allegations, but officials have refused to reveal any specifics about the case. The parent said his son and several other Sayreville players have been questioned by police. No charges have been filed. The parent also said he is in the process of retaining an attorney.            “These parents here, they’re in shock,” the parent said. “We never expected anything like this to happen. Your kid, he’s going to school, school’s got to be a place where you think the kid is the safest.”      When told of the specific allegations over the phone Wednesday, Labbe declined to comment. He referred to his previous comments calling the allegations “very serious.”      The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office declined comment on the allegations detailed by the Sayreville parent. Also, David Abromaitis, a detective in the office, declined comment Wednesday when reached by phone.      The parent said the “ringleaders” involved in the hazing are seniors.      Madeline Thillet, speaking at Tuesday night’s board of education meeting, said her son was one of the members of the team interviewed by investigators. She downplayed the hazing while protesting the cancellation of the season.      “I was at the police station with him when they were questioning him,” she said. “They were talking about a butt being grabbed. That’s about it. No one was hurt. No one died. I don’t understand why they’re being punished. I think that the forfeited game was punishment enough.”      The parent said he could not “understand how none of the coaches were aware of it. As a coach, you know what’s going on in your clubhouse. You know what’s going on in the locker room.”            On Oct. 1, Labbe said he was alerted to an anonymous allegation made to Sayreville police about a serious incident of inappropriate conduct —possibly more — by members of the football team. The next day, the matter was turned over to the Middlesex County prosecutor and Labbe canceled Sayreville’s football games — varsity, junior varsity and freshman contests — last weekend against rival South Brunswick.      Then, on Friday, in a separate incident, an attorney for assistant coach Charles Garcia said his client had resigned after details of his arrest for steroids possession surfaced.            On Monday, Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season.      The hazing allegations have turned Sayreville’s no frills, blue-collar community upside-down, as both local and national news vans and media reporters have descended on the town, scouring the streets and interviewing people in parking lots and strip malls.      Many Sayreville residents have expressed outrage over the cancellation of the football season. The varsity team, nicknamed the Bombers, has made the playoffs in each of the past 20 seasons, and Sayreville has captured three state championships over the past four years, feeding nearby Rutgers University with a host of elite players.      Sayreville longtime football coach George Najjar declined comment when reached by phone Wednesday.      More than a hundred Sayreville residents attended Tuesday night’s previously scheduled board of education meeting to urge the members to reconsider the decision to cancel the season. The crowd, at times, grew heated and animated, but the board affirmed the decision to end the football season.      Afterward, about a hundred people gathered under the lights on the football field, lingering for about 15 minutes, gazing across the impressive stadium, until it was time to go home.

The decision came after an emotional meeting that lasted more than two hours at the school with Labbe and parents of football players. The decision to cancel the season affects all levels of play -- freshman, junior varsity and varsity, Labbe said.      The Sayreville Police Department and Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office are investigating allegations, and based upon the initial findings, \\"there was enough evidence to substantiate there were incidents of harassment, intimidation and bullying that took place on a pervasive level, on a wide-scale level, and at a level in which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted,\\" Labbe said after the meeting.      He added: \\"This is a very sad day in Sayreville.\\"      Labbe did not identify the victims or alleged perpetrators, and said the school district will determine punishment if charges are filed against the alleged perpetrators.      The announcement is sure to rock the New Jersey high school football community and the storied Sayreville program, which has won three state championships in the past four years.      Parents emerged from the meeting tense and angry, with many speeding away without speaking to reporters.      \\"It’s bogus,\\" said Curtis Beckham, whose son is on the varsity team. \\"They’re holding the kids accountable and not holding the coaching staff and the teachers accountable. I don’t think what they’re doing is fair. A lot of the students who are innocent, they’re suffering.\\"      \\"I'm outraged that their season is taken away from them and they did nothing wrong,\\" added Theresa Tamburri, whose daughter is a freshman cheerleader at Sayreville. \\"Let them play. Give them their season back. Give them what they worked hard for.\\"      The meeting was called after it was revealed by Labbe last week that \\"inappropriate conduct of a significant and serious nature\\" had taken place within the Sayreville football program. Several people with knowledge of the allegations told NJ Advance Media the inappropriate conduct was hazing, and one parent said freshmen football players would \\"stampede\\" to the locker room after practices to get dressed before senior players entered.      Sayreville canceled games across all levels of play this past weekend, and Labbe hinted last week more games could be forfeited.      Unable to calm angry parents at last week's press conference, Labbe called for a private session -- closed to the media -- with parents on Monday night. The parking lots at Sayreville High filled shortly before 7 p.m. with cars decorated with Bombers flags, stickers and pennants.      Men wearing football varsity jackets and state championship T-shirts and holding a Sayreville flag crowded around the back of the school and acted aggressively toward reporters, warning them not to take photographs or attempt to speak to parents after the meeting. The men followed reporters throughout the parking lot, and more than once, one of the men declared, \\"Not in our town!\\"      Before the hazing allegations surfaced Friday, Charles Garcia, an assistant coach on the varsity team, was arrested and charged with possession of steroids following a traffic stop in Somerset County, police said. Garcia has not commented, but his attorney said the coach had resigned his position.      Sayreville head coach George Najjar also has been silent since news of the arrest and the hazing allegations have come to light. He declined to comment Friday when approached by a reporter.      When asked about the coaching staff and what role they may have played in the bullying, Labbe said he \\"cannot comment on personnel matters.”      Tamburri, the mother, said that the cheerleaders and marching band will also not be able to perform the rest of the season.      Her daughter, Jennifer Tamburri, a freshman cheerleader, said the school community is reeling from the news.      \\"Everybody was crying when they heard,\\" Jennifer Tamburri said. \\"It's just terrible seeing everyone so upset.\\"      Vernal Coleman and Jeremy Schneider of NJ Advance Media contributed to this report.

Play a memory game.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Unleashing the Power of Your Memory: Strategies for Effective Learning Introduction In today's fast-paced society, having an excellent memory plays a vital role in achieving success in various aspects of life. Whether you're a student, a professional, or simply someone who wants to improve their learning abilities, it's essential to know the most effective techniques to boost your memory. This article explores various memory-enhancing strategies, such as studying in intervals, self-quizzing, using sensory information, and playing memory games. 1. Studying in Intervals Learning in short, focused sessions followed by breaks - also known as interval studying - has been proven to significantly improve retention. This technique, based on the Pomodoro principle, involves breaking study sessions in manageable chunks, typically of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. The logic behind this approach draws from cognitive research, which reveals that our brains tend to fade out when focusing on a single task for an extended duration. By introducing breaks into study sessions, we allow our brains to rest and recharge, leading to improved focus and better retention of information. As a result, interval studying promotes an optimal learning environment. 2. Self-Quizzing Self-testing or quizzing is a powerful method of reinforcing our memory of new concepts. When we quiz ourselves, we engage in active recall, forcing our brains to retrieve information we've learned. This process solidifies new pathways in our memory, effectively enhancing recall. Moreover, self-quizzing allows us to identify areas of weakness that require further attention. Upon identifying these areas, it becomes easier to allocate additional study time and resources to reinforce the knowledge. Thus, self-testing is not only an effective method for memory enhancement but also offers a detailed roadmap for focused improvement. 3. Using Sensory Information Incorporating multiple senses in the learning process can lead to enhanced recall of information. When we use multiple senses to absorb data, our brain stores this information in different regions. As a result, multiple pathways are formed, making it easier to recall the learned material. For instance, when you're studying a new topic, you can use visual aids, listen to an audiobook or watch instructional videos, engage your sense of touch by writing or drawing, and even use mnemonics that involve taste or smell. This multisensory approach allows you to store the information in different ways, leading to better retrieval and stronger memory. 4. Playing Memory Games Games that challenge your memory can be a fun and engaging way to boost your cognitive abilities. By playing memory games, your brain undergoes mental exercise that strengthens the connections between different regions, leading to improved memory performance. There are various types of memory games available, such as puzzles, matching games, and association games. These games not only stimulate your brain, but they also help maintain your mental agility and cognitive resilience, making the learning process more effective and enjoyable. Conclusion Sharpening your memory skills has a wide range of benefits, both in personal and professional settings. By implementing the strategies outlined in this article – studying in intervals, self-quizzing, using a multisensory approach, and playing memory games – you can strengthen your cognitive abilities and achieve optimal learning outcomes. So, why wait? Start employing these techniques today and unlock the full potential of your memory."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is very important that you answer your doctor’s questions accurately and honestly, as some drugs are not suitable to be taken in conjunction with Botox treatments. Even health supplements such as vitamin tablets and fish oils should be brought to your doctor’s attention, as these can thin the blood and cause more bruising post-treatment. Specific medication that you may need to stop taking before your Botox treatment include:  Painkillers (aspirin, ibuprofen) Certain herbal remedies Antibiotics Heart disease-related drugs Alzheimer’s disease drugs Neurological disease drugs Vitamin-mineral supplements Your doctor may advise you to stop taking any aspirin-like products for a minimum of 4 days before the procedure.  This is due to the fact that aspirin causes bleeding, as it is an antiplatelet drug that prevents the blood from clotting. Taking aspirin before a Botox treatment may cause excessive bleeding during and after the procedure. Having alcohol in your system can make bruising and bleeding worse during a Botox procedure, so avoid consuming any alcoholic drinks for at least two days before the treatment.

I have watched quite a few Cold Case episodes over the years, beginning with Season 1 episodes back in 2003-2004. And while most have been good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Though some may not agree with the story content (i.e. the male-to-male romantic relationship), I doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit. The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on the testimony from a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960's named Sean Coop (aka, the cold case victim who goes by his last name, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno.  In the story, Coop is single, a Vietnam war vet, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at that time. The flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white, with bits of color now and then sprinkled throughout. Examples include their red squad car, the yellow curtains gently blowing by the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol-induced state. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale. The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and the two central actors only heightens the intensity of the episode. One key emotional scene was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected fellow officer on the force, confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, at this point, as the shame and disgrace of Coop's father was heaped upon Coop - \\"You are not going to disgrace our family...and you're not my son, either.\\" - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same-sex relationships of that era. Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another officer go at it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled \\"Batman and Robin homos\\".  As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once can see the tension in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids, his church, and yet his undying devotion to Coop. In the end, Jimmy walks away from Coop, realizing that he cannot have both Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force. The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop, as he sat dying from gunshot wounds in his squad car, quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner: \\"Jimmy...we were the lucky ones. Don't forget that.\\" The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett, playing the still grieving Jimmy, only much older by now, and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop. I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is without a doubt the most well-written, well-acted, and well done of all Cold Case episodes that I've ever seen.
