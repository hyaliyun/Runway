Your doctor may recommend that you do a prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis if the disorder runs in your family or if you are a carrier of the defective gene that causes it. The test is usually very accurate and can tell you if your baby’s genes are normal or if they are at risk of developing cystic fibrosis. However, taking this test is a very personal decision that you should discuss carefully with your doctor and your significant other, if they’re involved.

(CNN) -- Spain's Jose Manuel Lara claimed only the second European Tour title of his career with victory over Englishman David Lynn in a playoff at the end of the Austrian Open in Atzenbrugg. The 33-year-old, the winner of the 2007 Hong Kong Open, carded a best-of-the-day eight-under-par 64 to finish on 271 (-17), level with joint overnight leader Lynn -- who posted a 68 for his final 18 holes. The pair finished three strokes clear of Sweden's Alexander Noren, England's Danny Willet, who led with Lynn after the third round before falling away with a 71, and European Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell (69). However, on the first extra hole,","output":"the par-four 18th, it was Lara who kept his nerve and secured the win with a solid par as Lynn agonizingly bogeyed after finding the greenside bunker with his approach shot. This victory not only marks Lara's second European Tour title but also demonstrates the Spaniard's tremendous grit and determination to excel amidst intense competition. Despite starting the final round four shots behind the leaders, Lara produced an exceptional display of golf to close the gap and eventually force a playoff with Lynn. His round of 64, which included nine birdies and just one dropped shot, underlines the impressive form he displayed throughout the day. It is worth noting that Lara's triumph did not come as a complete surprise, given that he was previously successful at the 2007 Hong Kong Open, where he showed his capability to perform at the highest level. In contrast, Lynn, the joint overnight leader, managed a respectable round of 68, which consisted of six birdies and two bogeys. However, it wasn't enough to keep Lara at bay and deny him the coveted Austrian Open title. Despite the setback, Lynn's performance throughout the tournament demonstrates a high level of skill and consistency, which will undoubtedly serve as a source of motivation for future competitions. Finishing three strokes behind Lara and Lynn were a strong group of contenders, including Sweden's Alexander Noren, England's Danny Willet, and European Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell. Noren carded a final-round 67, while Willet, who led with Lynn after the third round, slipped to a 71. Meanwhile, McDowell managed a respectable 69, ensuring a solid end to his tournament campaign. This group, rich in talent and skill, served to intensify the battle for the Austrian Open title and kept the pressure on the eventual winner, Lara. The playoff at the end of the Austrian Open is emblematic of the competitiveness present in modern professional golf. The ability to perform at an elite level, under immense pressure, and in a sudden-death situation highlights the mental fortitude and physical prowess of these athletes. Lara's triumph in Atzenbrugg will serve as a reminder and inspiration to both seasoned professionals and aspiring golfers alike that success is often the result of defying the odds and fighting until the very end. In conclusion, Jose Manuel Lara's victory in the Austrian Open marks a significant achievement in his career, adding to his 2007 Hong Kong Open win. By overcoming a formidable field of competitors and forcing a playoff with the talented David Lynn, Lara has once again proven his mettle on the European Tour. This thrilling competition not only showcases the skill and intensity of professional golf but also serves as a testament to the resilience and determination required to excel in this elite sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(February 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino), a defense attorney in Baltimore, is in jail on a contempt of court charge after punching Judge Henry T. Fleming (John Forsythe) while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh (Thomas G. Waites). McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offence, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and has already spent a year and a half in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses McCullaugh's appeal due to its late submission and leaves him in prison. After being released, Arthur takes another case, that of a transgender Ralph Agee (Robert Christian), arrested for small crime and becoming a victim of the legal system. Arthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam (Lee Strasberg) in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer (Christine Lahti). Arthur has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford (Jack Warden), who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while a terrified Arthur begs him to land. Rayford, a veteran of the Korean War, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse, a 1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times, and eats his lunch on the ledge outside his office window, four stories up.

Movie title: Dracula Context: In Whitby, England in 1913, Count Dracula (Frank Langella) arrives from Transylvania via the ship Demeter one stormy night. A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home, and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride.

Florida came out on top over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game. \\"We need a playoff,\\" Obama told reporters after being asked about Florida's 24-14 victory over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game. \\"If I'm Utah, or if I'm USC or if I'm Texas, I might still have some quibbles.\\" Since its inception in 1998, the NCAA's Bowl Championship Series has weathered criticism from nearly all directions. The BCS is the system that chooses the contenders for college football's most prominent postseason games: the Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Sugar bowls, as well the National Championship game, which this year put Oklahoma against Florida. In 2008, legislators -- for one reason or another -- drafted legislation to invalidate the","output":"BCS and push for a playoff system as the preferred method to determine college football's national champion. Proponents of the playoff system argue that it would create a more even playing field, offering teams from smaller conferences and schools a better chance to prove themselves and compete for the ultimate title. Critics of the BCS, including Obama himself, declared that the current system often leads to unfair outcomes, as it relies heavily on polls, computer rankings, and a myriad of other factors that do not necessarily reflect a team's true capabilities or achievements on the field. Those in favor of maintaining the BCS argue that it helps preserve the longstanding tradition of college football bowl games, which often generate significant revenue for the participating schools and create exciting matchup opportunities for fans. Furthermore, proponents of the BCS suggest that it provides stability and predictability to the college football landscape by clearly specifying a set of criteria that teams must meet in order to qualify for one of the prestigious BCS bowl games. However, the anti-BCS sentiment has gained significant traction over the years, leading to heated debates among politicians, sports figures, and fans alike. Advocates for change assert that the BCS system creates an oligarchy of power in college football, where only a select few schools and conferences benefit from the system's structure, leaving smaller and less prominent athletic programs perpetually disadvantaged. Some of the suggested alternatives to the BCS include an eight or sixteen-team playoff, which would see the top teams in the nation compete in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. In this model, the winning team would have to demonstrate their prowess and consistency on the field by defeating a series of challengers in head-to-head matchups, rather than relying on the subjective opinions and calculations that help shape BCS rankings. While the playoff system has garnered widespread support, it has also encountered resistance from those who worry that it might dilute the significance and appeal of regular-season games. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential impact on student-athletes' educational commitments and the possibility of extending the season, which could lead to increased risk of player injuries. In summary, the debate over the BCS system and the need for a playoff system in college football is one that is driven by differing opinions on what constitutes a fair and equitable means of determining a national champion. While the BCS has succeeded in generating revenue and maintaining certain aspects of college football tradition, it has also been criticized as an exclusive and flawed approach to evaluating a team's worthiness for championship contention. As public opinion continues to shift, it remains to be seen whether a playoff system will eventually be implemented, providing a chance for more schools to vie for the prestigious title of National Champion. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, it is clear that passionate college football fans, players, administrators, and even President-elect Obama will continue to fight for what they believe is the best path forward for the beloved sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why did Seeker's superiors call off the search to find Wanderer? Movie plot title: The Host Movie plot: The human race has been taken over by small parasitic aliens called \\"Souls\\". They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by Seeker to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated, and it struggles to regain control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, forming a friendship. Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search. Returning to the caves, Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is alive. Jeb and Ian accept this, but... The answer is:","output":"Seeker's superiors called off the search to find Wanderer because Seeker accidentally killed another Soul during the chase. This action likely made her superiors question Seeker's competence and the effectiveness of the search, as it resulted in the loss of one of their own kind. Additionally, the situation had become increasingly dangerous, with two humans (Aaron and Brandt) committing suicide to avoid capture. The superiors may have decided that the risks involved in continuing the search outweighed the potential benefits of locating Wanderer and obtaining the information they sought.

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

But the identity of \\"Jihadi John\\" remained a mystery -- until Thursday, when two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed it. The man, the officials said, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. The officials, who've been briefed on the matter, spoke to CNN after a Washington Post report first revealed Emwazi's identity. Emwazi is believed to have traveled to Syria in 2012, according to the newspaper, and later to have joined ISIS there. Even with a name and face for the man behind the mask, uncertainty still swirled Thursday. London police and British officials declined to confirm his identity. Officials from a London-based human rights and Muslim advocacy organization who've interacted with Emwazi said they couldn't be 100% certain it was him.

So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing  it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals  to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water  . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria. What you can do: Try to get organic  food. Organic food doesn't have any ingredients  that are bad for the land, air or water. Don't eat processed food or drinks.

They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap.

We have this equation: 457 * b + 1133 * b + 23939 = -30121 First, let's add the parts with \\"b\\" together. So, we'll add 457 and 1133: 457 + 1133 = 1590 Now our equation looks like this: 1590 * b + 23939 = -30121 It's time to get \\"b\\" all alone on one side. To do that, we need to move 23939 to the other side of the equals sign. We do this by subtracting 23939 from both sides: -30121 - 23939 = -54060 Now our equation looks like this: 1590 * b = -54060 The last step is to find out what \\"b\\" is.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighbors attended the same school. Mike learned about  biology while Dan learned more about the weather. They both were among the best in the school.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person read more about humidity? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Dan, who learned more about the weather, would have read more about humidity. This is because humidity is one of the weather conditions mentioned in the background article, along with air temperature, wind speed and direction, and precipitation.

Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does?  Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system.

In recent years, the world has seen a rapid advancement in technology, particularly in the area of internet usage and online platforms. While this has brought numerous benefits to society, it has also unfortunately provided an avenue for potential harm to vulnerable individuals, especially children. As a result, it has become crucial to review and update existing policies and regulations to better protect young users from potential dangers, such as child sexual exploitation and grooming by pedophiles. One of the primary steps that can be taken to enhance the protection of children online is raising awareness among parents and other caregivers. They should be educated on how to identify potential risks, recognize signs of online grooming, and establish open communication lines with their children about internet safety. Additionally, parents should be encouraged to apply basic rules, including limiting screen time, adjusting privacy settings, and using age-appropriate content filters. Moreover, it is essential to invest in the development of advanced technologies that can automatically detect and block explicit content, inappropriate communication, and predators' online activities. Internet service providers, social media platforms, and other online services should be encouraged to adopt such advanced technologies to safeguard their users' welfare, especially that of children. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies should be provided with the necessary resources and training to tackle online exploitation of children. This includes the development of best practices for online investigations, international cooperation to apprehend perpetrators, and strategic partnerships with technology companies to dismantle criminal networks. Education is another crucial aspect in combatting the risk of pedophiles targeting children online. Schools, in partnership with parents and community organizations, should implement comprehensive digital citizenship and internet safety programs as part of their curriculum. These programs should focus on teaching children about responsible online behavior, personal information protection, and reporting suspicious or inappropriate encounters. Finally, governments should review and update existing legal frameworks to ensure that online sexual exploitation and grooming of children are criminalized and that perpetrators are effectively prosecuted. This may include implementing stricter penalties, promoting international legal cooperation, and establishing specialized courts or units to handle such cases. In conclusion, the growing prevalence of new technologies has opened the door to novel risks and forms of exploitation, particularly for children. To counter these evolving threats and protect young users online, it is imperative that governments and society as a whole take decisive action in updating and implementing robust measures to provide a safer online experience for children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem.

Step 1: Assess the situation The first step in continuing the story is to assess the situation and identify the main problem. The main issue in this case is that the Smiths are unable to fit their furniture into the van because it is too large. Step 2: Identify possible solutions The next step is to think about possible solutions that the characters in the story might consider. In this case, the potential solutions include: a) Disassembling the furniture to make it fit in the van. b) Renting a larger van. c) Selling or donating the large furniture and acquiring new furniture in their new home. d) Asking friends or neighbors for help. Step 3: Choose the most logical solution In order to make the story more believable, I would choose a solution that is logical and feasible. In this scenario, the best option would be to disassemble the furniture, if possible. Disassembling the furniture can make it easier to fit in the moving van, and will also minimize the need for additional expenses such as renting a larger van or buying new furniture. Step 4: Write the continuation of the story Mrs. Smith looked at the van and then at the oversized furniture, feeling a sense of frustration. She turned and said to her husband, \\"We can't fit this couch into the van like this. Let's try taking it apart, maybe it'll fit better that way.\\" Mr. Smith nodded, agreeing that it was the best option. He went to the garage to get some tools while Mrs. Smith started carefully removing the cushions and decorative pillows from the couch. They worked together, taking apart not only the couch but also some other larger pieces of furniture like their dining table and entertainment center. Each piece was carefully disassembled, wrapped, and placed in the van strategically. Mr. Smith used his Tetris skills, continuously reorganizing the van to make every item fit as efficiently as possible. Step 5: Add a sense of closure The sun was setting as the couple finished loading the van, beads of sweat glistening on their foreheads. They looked at each other with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that disassembling the furniture had been the right decision. They locked the fully loaded van and turned to their now-empty house, taking one last look before they would set off on the next exciting chapter of their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET! O'REILLY: Continuing now with our lead story. The Obama administration objecting to critical reporting of it. Speaking on the radio today, former Clinton advisor Lanny Davis said that while he was writing a column his editor was threatened by the Obama Administration. DAVIS: He received a phone call from a senior Obama White House official who didn't like some of my columns, even though I'm a supporter of him, I couldn't imagine why this call was made. And he did threaten and the word I was told was the word \\"threaten\\" by this editor that if he continued to run my columns, he would lose or his reporters would lose their White House credentials. O'REILLY: And joining us now from Washington is Mr. Davis. So first of all, what do you think teed off the Obama Administration? What did you write about them? DAVIS: You know I went back to read my columns 95 percent of them were supporting President Obama. I'm guess that I criticized at times their handling of the stories. The crisis management sides of the communication shop and I think that might have gotten under the skin of the person who made the phone call. O'REILLY: All right. Now, who is the White House guy who threatened the editor? DAVIS: I can't tell that you because the editor when he called me said I have to ask you to honor the request that you never mention the name of the person who called me because he said it was off the record. So I talk to the editor -- O'REILLY: Ok so let me get this straight. So -- so let me get this straight your editor agreed to be threatened and not to publicize who is doing the threat? That doesn't sound right. That doesn't sound right to me man. I have been a reporter for more than 35 years. I don't give anybody off the record credence if they are going to threaten me. Do you know what I'm talking about? DAVIS: Well, he asked me to keep it anonymous and I have got to honor that. O'REILLY: All right, you're an honorable man. Ok. Now, you were in -- Clinton White House. I mean, they did the same thing Bill and Hillary they don't like people criticizing them, did they? DAVIS: Look, there is nothing wrong with pushing back as Ed Henry said. And I don't think Gene Sperling -- I accept your interpretation -- intended it to be a threat. But he should have been on the White House lawn yesterday saying you know I used the word you're going to regret it I respect Bob Woodward he's a great reporter. We have a disagreement. And I apologize if there was a misinterpretation. This story -- I wouldn't be on tonight if they had done it yesterday. But waiting is another example of crisis mismanagement. O'REILLY: No but it's more than that. Plouffe goes and Twitters that Woodward is a has-been. Come on. DAVIS: I can't figure that -- David Plouffe is a pro. Why in god's name would he take on an icon, one of the great reporters of our age and still doing. O'REILLY: But he did it, I don't know why did he it but he did it. Now you dodged my question -- you dodged my question very neatly, Lanny. But you know you can't slip it by me. Bill and Hillary Clinton if they criticize them they do the same thing. DAVIS: Ok so Bill and Hillary Clinton as far as I know never threatened a reporter. They were unhappy with critical reporting -- every White House is. Reagan, Carter, Clinton, Bush -- there isn't a single White House that loves the White House reporters. But I never was aware of anybody being threatened. And I accept Gene Sperling's explanation he didn't intend that but no I don't believe he intended anything like that. O'REILLY: All right, do you believe based on your personal experience that the Obama Administration is more sensitive than the other people and overreacts to media criticism? Do you believe that? DAVIS: No. They are no different than any other White House which is sensitive to criticism and sometimes has individuals acting stupidly. This one individual who called my editor made some very serious threats against me professionally. I called several people at the White House and 48 hours later I was told it's over it will never happen again. O'REILLY: But you're still protecting this weasel. DAVIS: I have to under the obligation of my -- O'REILLY: You have to protect the weasel? All right. O'REILLY: Why don't you tell us somebody else -- tell us somebody and have them call me.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention  of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim  position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed.

Very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products.

News article: Bill Clinton Presses Senators to Pass Health Bill WASHINGTON -- Former President Bill Clinton came to Capitol Hill Tuesday to underline for Democrats the political consequences of failing to pass a health overhaul, saying doing nothing was the worst outcome. Bill Clinton, right, is accompanied by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse as he heads to a lunch with Senate Democrats at the Capitol on Tuesday. Mr. Clinton spoke as both sides in the Senate braced for a battle on the floor. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Tuesday that once Senate debate begins, Republicans would offer \\"a lot of amendments\\" on subjects from abortion to immigration to a government-run insurance plan. \\"This is a big bill,\\" Mr. McConnell told reporters. \\"The majority seeks to take over one-sixth of our economy.\\" The appearance by Mr. Clinton, whose own attempt at a health bill failed 15 years ago, reflected the urgency Democrats feel to maintain the momentum behind the bill following its narrow House passage Saturday and signs of a tempestuous debate ahead in the Senate. Some Democrats remain skeptical about the legislation. \\"Failure could be passing a bad bill,\\" said Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Mr. Clinton spoke to a closed-door meeting of Senate Democrats as party leaders were struggling to contain a growing number of conflicting demands and ultimatums from senators. \\"It's not important to be perfect here. It's important to act, to move, to start the ball rolling,\\" Mr. Clinton said afterward. \\"And whatever they can get the votes for, I'm going to support.\\" As costs have risen, attempts at change Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) has submitted a Senate version to the Congressional Budget Office for a cost estimate. Once the CBO issues its report, probably by week's end, the bill would be cleared to come to the Senate floor. But Democrats need 60 votes -- every Democrat and the Senate's two independents -- simply to begin debate. And it isn't clear they have those votes yet. Mr. Nelson says he won't support starting debate on a bill that doesn't contain strong language restricting federal funding of abortion. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent who caucuses with the Democrats, says he won't support a package that includes a government-administered health plan to compete with private insurers. Democratic leaders want their members to refrain from making non-negotiable demands, fearing that will undercut the bill before it even comes to the floor. If the Senate begins considering the bill, Democratic leaders hope the ensuing amendments and horse-trading will produce legislation that eases many senators' concerns. \\"It's critically important that individual senators refrain from laying down markers, because you could then get to a point where it becomes very difficult to see this bill moving forward,\\" said Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.) \\"All of us are going to have to give a little bit if we believe that this is an important issue that needs to be dealt with.\\" Republicans say the Democratic proposals fail to address the problem of rising medical costs. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) said the Democrats' legislation will cripple the economy by increasing taxes. \\"It's going to fall on a lot of average middle-class Americans,\\" Mr. Thune said. Senators who attended Mr. Clinton's half-hour lunchtime talk said the former president emphasized that a bill must pass this year so President Barack Obama can focus on reversing the spiking unemployment rate. \\"Getting this done this year will in effect clear the table and allow the focus to be on jobs,\\" said Sen.

He is more popularly known as the earthly father of the Pandavas. He was said to be a great warrior and expanded his kingdom during his rule.  - The Mahabharata or Mahbhrata (US ; UK  \\"\\") is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the \\"Ramayana\\".  - In Indian epic poetry, Vasudeva (Devanagari , IAST \\") is the father of Krishna. He was the brother of cowherds tribe chieftain Nanda Baba who was a Surasena who was foster father of Lord Krishna. His sister Kunti was married to Pandu. Kunti plays a big role later in the war Mahabharata.  Vasudeva was a partial incarnation of Rishi Kashyapa.  The patronymic \\" (with long \\"\\") is a popular name of Krishna. According to the Harivansa Purana, Vasudeva and Nanda were brothers.  - Hindu Mythology is large figure of mythical narratives in Hinduism found in Hindu texts such as the epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana, Ancient Tamil literature (such as the Sangam literature and Periya Puranam), several other regional literature of South Asia. As such, it is a subset of mainstream Indian and Nepali culture. Rather than one consistent, monolithic structure, the same myth appears in various versions, varies with diverse traditions, developed by different sects, people and philosophical schools, in different regions and at different times, which are not necessarily held by all Hindus to be literal accounts of historical events, but are taken to have deeper, often symbolic, meaning, and which have been given a complex range of interpretations.  - The Ramayana (\\"\\") is an ancient Indian epic poem which narrates the struggle of the divine prince Rama to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana. Along with the \\"Mahabharata\\", it forms the Sanskrit \\"Itihasa\\".  - Arjuna (in Devanagari:  \\"\\") along with Krishna is the protagonist of the ancient Indian epic \\"Mahabharata\\" and plays a key role in the Bhagavad Gita alongside Krishna.

His children included Srutakarma, Iravan, Babruvahana, and Abhimanyu.  - In the Hindu epic \\"Mahabharata\\", Bhima (Sanskrit: ) (birth year about 3200BC) is the second of the Pandavas. The Mahabharata relates many events which portray the immense might of Bhima. Bhima is responsible for slaying all hundred Kaurava brothers in the Kurukshetra War.  - Rama (Sanskrit:  \\"Rma\\") or Sr Rmachandra (Sanskrit :  ) is the seventh avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu.

Because he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the Aviation Cadet Training Program. On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and received his pilot rating in 1938 at Kelly Field in San Antonio.  After graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the 16th Observation Squadron, which was based at Lawson Field, Georgia, with a flight supporting the Infantry School at nearby Fort Benning. It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a department store in Columbus, Georgia. The two quietly married in a Roman Catholic seminary in Holy Trinity, Alabama on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper. They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from Huntingdon College and Auburn University. He was a colonel in the United States Army Reserves and worked as a hospital pharmacist. He died in West Monroe, Louisiana, in 2016. The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in Georgiana in Butler County in southern Alabama.  While Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning, he was promoted to first lieutenant and served as a personal pilot for Brigadier General George S. Patton, Jr., in 1940 and 1941. In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the 9th Bombardment Squadron of the 3d Bombardment Group at Hunter Field, Savannah, Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the A-20 Havoc. While there he was promoted to captain. In December 1941, he received orders to join the 29th Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, for training on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while listening to the radio during a routine flight. Due to fears that German U-Boats might enter Tampa Bay and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah. Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, with 21 B-18 Bolo medium bombers.

Options: a ) 228 , b ) 278 , c ) 300 , d ) 500 , e ) 821","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for simple interest: Interest (I) = Principal (P) * Rate (R) * Time (T). We are given: Rate (R) = 4% per annum Time (T) = 8 years Interest (I) = P - 204 (since the interest is Rs. 204 less than the sum lent) We need to find the principal amount (P). Using the formula for simple interest, we have: I = P * R * T Substitute the given values and the expression for I: P - 204 = P * (4/100) * 8 Now, we need to solve this equation for P. Divide both sides by 8: (P - 204) / 8 = P * (1/25) Cross-multiply: (P - 204) * 25 = P * 8 Distribute the 25 on the left side: 25P - 5100 = 8P Subtract 8P from both sides: 17P = 5100 Now, divide both sides by 17 to find P: P = 5100 / 17 P = 300 So, the sum lent was Rs. 300, making the correct answer choice 'c' (300)."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The 25th Cannes Film Festival was held on May 419, 1972.

Question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize?

Translate this to English?","output":"Highlights of November 2007: Budget surplus of 0.1 billion dollars A budget surplus of 0.1 billion dollars was recorded in November 2007, compared to a surplus of 0.5 billion in November 2006. In November 2007, a significant financial milestone was achieved as a budget surplus of 0.1 billion dollars (100 million dollars) was recorded. This represented a positive development in the country's financial status, as it showcased the government's ability to generate more revenue than its total expenditures during that particular month. It is important to note, however, that this surplus was lower compared to the figure recorded in November 2006, which stood at 0.5 billion dollars (500 million dollars). To understand the context of this budget surplus, it would be useful to consider the contributing factors that led to this achievement. Some of these factors could include improved economic growth, efficient fiscal management, and the implementation of appropriate monetary policies. Moreover, this milestone also highlights the importance of proper economic planning and evaluation, which allows the government to allocate its resources effectively and minimize any potential wastage. Another significant aspect to consider is the potential impact of this budget surplus on the nation's overall financial health. For example, the surplus can be used to pay down existing debt, invest in critical infrastructure, or be kept as a rainy-day fund to prepare for any future financial crises or downturns. Furthermore, a budget surplus sends a positive signal to investors and international organizations, as it is often seen as an indicator of a healthy and well-managed economy. However, it is also crucial to understand that a budget surplus does not necessarily guarantee financial stability or economic prosperity indefinitely. Governments must continue to be diligent in their fiscal planning and ensure that the policies and measures put in place are sustainable and will continue to yield positive results in the long term. In conclusion, the budget surplus of 0.1 billion dollars recorded in November 2007 signifies a noteworthy accomplishment that highlights the effectiveness of various fiscal management strategies employed by the government at the time. Despite being smaller than the surplus of the previous year, it still marked a positive development in the nation's financial landscape. Such achievements highlight the importance of continuous evaluation, efficient resource allocation, and prudent policy implementation to maintain and enhance a country's financial stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No. The following sentence \\"Telman was a short and stocky kid.\\" does not follow, given the preceding text. According to the provided information, Telman Thurgood was described as a lanky kid who had trouble with his limbs and was teased at school because of it. The word \\"lanky\\" typically refers to someone who is tall, thin, and ungraceful in their movements. This description contradicts the statement that Telman was short and stocky. Despite his physical challenges and the teasing from his peers, Telman went on to become an Olympic gold medalist in swimming at the age of 19. His mother's advice to ignore the teasing and her belief in his destiny proved to be correct, as Telman was able to find success and achieve great heights in his swimming career.

Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works.

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given product review, the sentiment appears to be mixed. The reviewer acknowledges that the vendor provided timely and good-quality service, but the product itself—specifically, the zapper—does not work on new technology because it is outdated. The reviewer seems to have found it a fun idea but ultimately decided to use a different product, such as the Wii remote, which may offer a similar experience. The review is not entirely positive because the zapper fails to work on newer devices, which limits its usefulness for the reviewer. However, the reviewer does not seem to be upset with the vendor or the product's condition. This suggests that rather than a purely positive review, the sentiment here is more neutral. The reviewer acknowledges their fault for not knowing the compatibility limitations but still expresses some disappointment in not being able to use the zapper for its intended purpose, such as playing games like Duck Hunt. It's essential to understand that the inability to use the product on new devices is not inherently a negative aspect of the product itself as it might still work effectively on older devices for which it was designed. Instead, the disappointment arises from the reviewer's expectations not being met due to their personal circumstances (e.g., not owning a compatible device).

Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, oh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a \\"fish out of water\\" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the \\"fish\\" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time. (I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the \\"in your face\\" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.)  As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie. Now, what is this review like? pick from the following.  1). negative  2). positive","output":"This review can be classified as 1). negative. While the reviewer acknowledges enjoying Bing Crosby in other movies and mentions some positive aspects such as the unique premise, supporting cast, scenery, and music, the overall tone of the review is critical.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774  7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".  - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel.  - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting .

Given the question: Information:  - The xylophone (from the Greek words \\"xylon\\", \\"wood\\" + \\"phn\\", \\"sound, voice\\", meaning \\"wooden sound\\") is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use.  - A metallophone is any musical instrument consisting of tuned metal bars which are struck to make sound, usually with a mallet.  - Tembang sunda, also called seni mamaos cianjuran, is a style of classical vocal music that originated in the Priangan highland of western Java. Unlike Sundanese gamelan music, tembang sunda was developed in the court of the regent Kabupaten Cianjur during the Dutch colonial period (mid-nineteenth century). The traditional vocal portion is sung free verse poetry, the instrumental accompaniment being performed on kacapi (zither), suling (bamboo flute) and sometimes, rebab (violin). A more modern, and metrical, form of lyrics exists that is called panambih.  - Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ; Sundanese: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) Census released in December 2015, Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.  - Kacapi is a zither-like Sundanese musical instrument played as the main accompanying instrument in the Tembang Sunda or Mamaos Cianjuran, kacapi suling (tembang Sunda without vocal accompaniment) genre (called \\"kecapi seruling\\" in Indonesian), pantun stories recitation or an additional instrument in Gamelan Degung performance.  - Gamelan Degung is a Sundanese musical ensemble that uses a subset of modified gamelan instruments with a particular mode of pelog scale. The instruments are manufactured under local conditions in towns in West Java such as Bogor. Degung music is often played at public gatherings in West Java, such as at local elections, as well as many other events. There is international interest in degung as well amongst communities in other countries interested in Indonesia and gamelan music.  - Kacapi suling is a form of Sundanese music from West Java. It is essentially \\"tembang Sunda\\" minus vocals, and also at interludes between songs at a typical Tembang Sunda performance. The higher pitched kacapi rincik, the lower pitched kacapi indung and the suling flute are the instruments used for kacapi suling. Kacapi suling has instrumental pieces performed in two different scales; the first four in laras pelog convey a light mood, the last four, in laras sorog are more slow and grave. The change to laras sorog usually takes place at midnight and lasts til sunrise.  - The siter and celempung are plucked string instruments used in Javanese gamelan . They are related to the kacapi used in Sundanese gamelan . The siter and celempung each have between 11 and 13 pairs of strings , strung on each side , between a box resonator . Typically the strings on one side tuned to pélog and the other to slendro . The siter is generally about a foot long and fits in a box ( which it is set upon while played ) , while the celempung is about three feet long and sits on four legs , and is tuned one octave below the siter . They are used as one of the elaborating instruments ( panerusan ) , that play cengkok ( melodic patterns based on the balungan ) . Both the siter and celempung play at the same speed as the gambang ( which is rapidly ) . The name \`\` siter '' comes from the Dutch word \`\` citer '' , which corresponds to the English word \`\` zither '' . \`\` Celempung '' is related to the Sundanese musical form celempungan . The strings of the siter are played with the thumbnails , while the fingers are used to dampen the strings when the next one is hit , as is typical with instruments in the gamelan . The fingers of both hands are used for the damping , with the right hand below the strings and the left hand above them . Siters and celempung of various sizes are the characteristic instrument in Gamelan Siteran , although they are used in many other varieties of gamelan as well .  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - The rebab (\\"rabb\\", variously spelled \\"rebap\\", \\"rabab\\", \\"rebeb\\", \\"rababa\\" and \\"rabeba\\", also known as jawza or \\"joza\\" in Iraq) is a type of a bowed string instrument so named no later than the 8th century and spread via Islamic trading routes over much of North Africa, the Middle East, parts of Europe, and the Far East. The bowed variety often has a spike at the bottom to rest on the ground (see first image to the right), and is thus called a spike fiddle in certain areas, but plucked versions like the \\"kabuli rebab\\" (sometimes referred to as the \\"robab\\" or \\"rubab\\") also exist.   - Bali (Balinese: ) is an island and province of Indonesia. The province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. It is located at the westernmost end of the Lesser Sunda Islands, between Java to the west and Lombok to the east. Its capital, Denpasar, is located in the southern part of the island.  - Gamelan is the traditional ensemble music of Java and Bali in Indonesia, made up predominantly of percussive instruments. The most common instruments used are metallophones played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called \\"kendhang\\" which register the beat. Other instruments include xylophones, bamboo flutes, a bowed instrument called a \\"rebab\\", and even vocalists called \\"sindhen\\".  - Zither (or ) is a class of stringed instruments.    What is the relationship between 'siter' and 'musical instrument'? The answer is:","output":"The siter is a type of musical instrument belonging to the plucked string instruments family and is predominantly used in Javanese gamelan, a traditional Indonesian musical ensemble. It is closely related to the kacapi, a similar instrument used in Sundanese gamelan. The siter consists of 11 to 13 pairs of strings with each side strung on a box resonator. Typically, the strings on one side are tuned to pélog, while the other side is tuned to slendro, both being traditional Javanese music scales. The siter's name comes from the Dutch word \\"citer,\\" which corresponds to the English word \\"zither.\\"  As an integral part of the Javanese gamelan ensemble, the siter plays an elaborating role, contributing to the development of melodic patterns or cengkok based on the balungan, which is the core melody. It is played at the same speed as the gambang, another elaborating instrument in the ensemble. The siter is played using the thumbnails to pluck the strings while using the fingers to dampen the strings, a technique typically found in gamelan instruments. In a broader context, the siter, as a musical instrument, plays an essential role in preserving and promoting traditional Indonesian music culture, especially in the context of Javanese gamelan. It contributes to the unique sound and texture of the ensemble and showcases the rich musical heritage of the Indonesian archipelago. Being a part of gamelan music, the siter also reflects the social, cultural, and artistic values embedded in Javanese and Indonesian society, as gamelan ensembles are often performed during various religious, social, and cultural events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There has to be a less hilarious shelf to put this rack on other than next to the Captain America toothbrushes, though. Doesn’t there?

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin?

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Possible answers: -- It may constitute a challenge to computer progranmers.. -- It accompanies all machinery involving high technology.. -- It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language.. -- It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: As Artificial Intelligence(AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language. For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. \\"You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,\\" said Russell. Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do. It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules. Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless. The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo . One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation. If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else. The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity. Question: What does the author say about the threat of robots? Answer: A:","output":"The author acknowledges the growing concerns about the threat of robots as Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated. The potential danger, however, can be avoided if human values are translated into a programmable code, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell.

The author suggests that robots could be dangerous only if programmers are careless or fail to perform sufficient testing, leading to a system that breaks certain taboos. By programming robots to consult humans in unusual situations, we can mitigate these risks. Finally, the most challenging step in programming values would be deciding our moral beliefs and creating a set of ethical rules.

Translate this to English?","output":"The conversion of (mostly decomposed) organic material is possible through several processes. In this sentence, the German phrase \\"Die Umsetzung des (meist abgestorbenen) organischen Materials\\" refers to the transformation or conversion of mostly decomposed organic material. This organic matter has typically gone through a natural decay process, which plays a vital role in nutrient cycling, the breakdown of complex molecules, and the generation of new compounds. The latter part of the sentence \\"ist über mehrere Prozesse möglich\\" translates to \\"is possible through several processes.\\" These processes involve various physical, chemical, and biological steps, which can convert the decomposed organic material into different forms, such as humus, nutrient-rich substances, and energy resources. Some of these methods include: 1. Decomp osition: This is the initial breakdown of organic matter by decomposers like bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. They secrete enzymes to disintegrate complex organic compounds, ultimately resulting in the formation of simpler compounds like carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients, which can be used by plants.                  2. Mineralization: It is the process by which organic matter is converted into inorganic minerals. The decomposition products formed above are acted upon by other microorganisms, resulting in the release of elements like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are essential for plant growth.  3. Humification: This process involves the formation of humus, a dark-colored, highly stable organic matter, from the partially decomposed remains of plants and animals. Humus is beneficial for soil structure, aeration, and water-holding capacity. It also serves as a long-term storage form of essential nutrients. 4. Methanogenesis: In this process, microorganisms called methanogens produce methane gas from organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Methanogenesis is a crucial step in anaerobic digestion and biogas production, which can be used as an alternative energy source. 5. Composting: Composting is a controlled process of decomposing organic materials, such as agriculture and food waste, yard trimmings, and other biodegradable materials, into a stable and nutrient-rich product called compost. This process accelerates natural decomposition by providing the right environmental conditions, such as appropriate moisture and temperature levels and proper aeration. These various processes contribute to the recycling of nutrients within ecosystems and can also provide energy sources for sustainable development, further illustrating the importance of the conversion of decomposed organic matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated  and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims. A 2003 decree  by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area. Biritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away.

Options: a. 42, b. 46, c. 50, d. 54, e. 58 A:","output":"Step 1: Let Paula's current age be P and Karl's current age be K. Step 2: According to the first part of the problem, 5 years ago Paula was 3 times as old as Karl. So, we can write the equation: P - 5 = 3(K - 5). Step 3: Simplify the equation: P - 5 = 3K - 15. Step 4: According to the second part of the problem, in 6 years Paula will be twice as old as Karl. So, we can write the equation: P + 6 = 2(K + 6). Step 5: Simplify the equation: P + 6 = 2K + 12. Step 6: We now have a system of linear equations: P - 5 = 3K - 15. P + 6 = 2K + 12. Step 7: Solve for P from the second equation: P = 2K + 12 - 6. P = 2K + 6. Step 8: Substitute this value of P into the first equation: (2K + 6) - 5 = 3K - 15. Step 9: Simplify and solve for K: 2K + 1 = 3K - 15. K = 16. Step 10: Now that we have Karl's current age, we can find Paula's current age using P = 2K + 6. P = 2(16) + 6. P = 32 + 6. P = 38. Step 11: To find the sum of their ages now, we simply add their ages together: Sum = P + K. Sum = 38 + 16. Sum = 54. Answer: The sum of their ages now is 54.

An inquest into the death of a woman accused of trolling Madeleine McCann's parents has been adjourned after a post-mortem examination yesterday failed to establish a cause of death. An inquest at Leicester Coroner's Court was told the post-mortem examination conducted yesterday had failed to establish the cause of 63-year-old Brenda Leyland's death. A few days earlier she had been confronted by Sky News reporter Martin Brunt about trolling the McCanns on Twitter. During the exchange, Mrs Leyland initially refused to speak but then replied: ‘I’m entitled to do that.’ Opening the inquest, Leicester Coroner Catherine Mason was told there was no evidence of foul play or third party involvement in the death. Police Sergeant Kevin Taylor told the coroner he was informed that Mrs Leyland was dead after being sent to the Marriott Hotel in Enderby. The officer said: 'At the scene I was joined by another officer and a county ambulance first responder unit. 'I was then informed by the paramedic and the other officer that there was a deceased female within the room.' Sgt Taylor added that officers were awaiting the results of additional post-mortem tests and were still undertaking inquiries into the death. Adjourning the inquest until December 18, Mrs Mason said: 'It's quite clear from the evidence before me that I am not in a position to conclude (the inquest) today. 'The cause of death is still not known and police inquiries are rightly ongoing. 'Therefore, with the sergeant still tasked to complete the police inquiries and the pathologist still to provide a cause of death, I am adjourning the inquest.' Officers from Leicestershire Police, who are not treating the death as suspicious, were alerted to the discovery of Ms Leyland's body at 1.42pm on Saturday. Mrs Leyland, from Burton Overy, Leicestershire, is reported to have posted thousands of messages on Twitter attacking the McCanns, whose daughter Madeleine disappeared in Portugal in 2007. The 63-year-old tweeted that she ‘hated’ Kate and Gerry McCann and launched online diatribes about their behaviour in the aftermath of their daughter’s disappearance. But unlike other ‘internet trolls’, she did not appear to have made threats against the couple. The Marriot Hotel in Enderby, where Mrs Leyland's body was found by police on Saturday afternoon.

Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from \\"white goods\\" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.  - Microsoft Office is an office suite of applications, servers, and services developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on 1 August 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On 10 July 2012, Softpedia reported that Office is used by over a billion people worldwide.  - The Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft.

As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - Windows IoT, formerly Windows Embedded, is a family of operating systems from Microsoft designed for use in embedded systems. Microsoft currently has three different subfamilies of operating systems for embedded devices targeting a wide market, ranging from small-footprint, real-time devices to point of sale (POS) devices like kiosks. Windows Embedded operating systems are available to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who make it available to end users preloaded with their hardware, in addition to volume license customers in some cases.  - Linus Benedict Torvalds (born December 28, 1969) is a Finnish software engineer who is the creator and, for a long time, principal developer, of the Linux kernel; which became the kernel for operating systems such as the Linux operating system, Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed revision control system Git and the diving logging and planning software Subsurface. He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland \\"in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel\\". He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award.  - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

What may happen after I bought the software ?","output":"After purchasing the software, several things may happen. Here is a detailed account of the possible events that might occur: 1. Installation process: Once you bring the software home, you would likely attempt to install it on your computer. You would insert the software disc (or use the digital download code if it was a digital purchase) into your computer and follow the installation prompts provided by the software's installer. 2. Encountering the issue: During the installation process, you would discover that there is a scratch on the disc, preventing the installation from proceeding further. This would be an unexpected issue that would hinder you from using the software you just purchased. 3. Seeking a solution: After encountering the problem, you might try to find a workaround for the scratch, such as cleaning the disc gently with a soft, lint-free cloth. You may also consider searching online for potential solutions to fix scratched discs or assessing if the installation can be completed through an alternative method (e.g., downloading the software from the publisher's website using the provided product key). 4. Deciding to return the product: If none of the attempted solutions work, you would likely decide to return the software to the store where you purchased it, as it is essentially unusable in its current state. Having the original receipt and packaging would be beneficial as they are typically required for returns at most retail establishments. 5. Visiting the store: You would then visit the store where you bought the software, possibly bringing the receipt, original packaging, and the scratched disc with you. At the store, you would likely approach a customer service representative or staff member and explain the situation to them. 6. Requesting a refund or exchange: During your interaction with the customer service representative, you would request a refund or an exchange due to the defective product. Depending on the store's return policy and the duration between the purchase and return, they may offer you a refund, store credit, or an exchange for a new, undamaged copy of the software. 7. Resolving the issue: Once the matter has been resolved to your satisfaction, you would return home with either a refund, store credit, or another copy of the software. 8. Trying again: If you have received another copy of the software, you would once more attempt to install it on your computer. With the new, undamaged disc, the installation process should progress without issues, and you should be able to use the software as intended. Overall, after purchasing the software and discovering the scratch, you would likely attempt several solutions to overcome the installation problem before deciding to return the product to the store. The return process, involving interaction with customer service, would result in a refund, store credit, or an exchange for a functional copy of the software, which you could then install and use on your computer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Q: What is the term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process.

On the fateful day, the U.S. aircraft was on a routine non-combat mission over Zaire's airspace when it was suddenly met with gunfire. According to initial reports, the attack appeared to be unprovoked and took the crew by surprise. (Step 1: Introduce the main event - a U.S. aircraft being shot at over Zaire) The aircraft, which was fortunately not hit, immediately initiated evasive maneuvers to escape the danger and moved toward the safety of international airspace. It is speculated that despite the swift reaction by the pilots, the attack could have resulted in the loss of lives and significant damage to the aircraft, had it been successful. (Step 2: Describe the outcome and response of the plane's crew) In light of this incident, authorities are investigating to determine the identity of the attackers and their motive. Early assessments suggest that local militants or rebels could be responsible, as the attack may be a symptom of the ongoing political unrest and violence that has been plaguing Zaire for years. (Step 3: Discuss the possible motives behind the attack and the ongoing situation in Zaire) The United States government has expressed its concern over the attack and the safety of its personnel in the region. They have urged the Zaire authorities to take appropriate action to ensure the security of foreign nationals and their assets in the country. The attack also prompts an examination of the current measures in place to maintain a secure environment in the conflict-ridden nation. (Step 4: Include the reactions and concerns from the United States and the implication for the security situation) This unprovoked attack on the U.S. aircraft highlights the mounting risks and perils associated with operating in Zaire's fragile environment. The global community must come together to address these threats and find a sustainable solution to foster peace, stability, and security for both the people of Zaire and those impacted by the deteriorating situation that it creates.

Tweet:is getting mad that i cant get my picture to upload","output":"The sentiment expressed in the tweet: \\"is getting mad that I can't get my picture to upload\\" is negative.  Sentiment analysis is the technique of identifying and categorizing a person's feelings, emotions, or opinions from a piece of text. It primarily focuses on three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. In understanding the sentiment of the text, we must critically analyze the words and their contextual implication.  In the given tweet, the user conveys dissatisfaction or frustration with the situation, which is indicated by the words \\"mad\\" and \\"can't.\\" The user is frustrated because they can't upload their picture. This statement exhibits a negative sentiment because the words mentioned have a particularly negative connotation.  The words \\"mad\\" and \\"can't\\" are the sentiment-bearing words in this scenario. \\"Mad\\" is often used to express a negative emotion such as anger or annoyance, while \\"can't\\" denotes an inability to do something which, especially in a context of frustration, is also received negatively. Both form a negative sentiment when combined in the context of the tweet.  Hence, the tweet does not mirror a positive or neutral sentiment as the user is clearly frustrated (negative emotion) with their inability (portraying disadvantage or negative experience) to perform a task, which in this case is uploading a picture. Therefore, while analyzing the words and context closely, we can understand that the author of the tweet feels a negative sentiment towards their current situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's an expanded answer incorporating these details: During the late Carboniferous and early Permian period, approximately 299 to 359 million years ago, some giant insects, specifically dragonfly-like creatures known as Meganeura, roamed the Earth with wingspans ranging from 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 inches), making them far larger than any living insect. These ancient arthropods belonged to the order Protodonata, which includes the ancestors of today's dragonflies and damselflies.  One of the most well-known species within this group is Meganeura monyi. With a wingspan reaching up to 65 cm (25.6 inches) and a body length of around 43 cm (17 inches), it was an impressive predator in the tropical swamps that covered much of the Earth during that era.  There are several factors believed to be responsible for the large size of these insects. One primary reason is the high levels of oxygen in the atmosphere during this period. The late Carboniferous had oxygen levels estimated to be around 35%, significantly higher than the 21% found in today's atmosphere. This increased oxygen availability allowed insects to develop larger and more efficient respiratory systems, supporting their massive size.  Another contributing factor is the absence of certain ecological traits and competitors that exist today, which has limited the growth of insects. During the Carboniferous and early Permian periods, flying vertebrates such as birds and bats were yet to evolve; thus, there was little competition in the skies for these giant insects. Lastly, these large creatures also benefitted from the abundance of plant life during this time, providing ample resources to support their energy needs. In conclusion, during the late Carboniferous and early Permian period, giant dragonfly-like insects, specifically within the order Protodonata, had wingspans reaching up to 70 cm due to a combination of high oxygen levels, limited competition, and ample resources. This made these insects far larger than any living insect today and highlights the different environmental conditions of Earth millions of years ago."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:There was no additional air in the tire the second time Lawrence checked the air pressure, but something did change between the two measurements. The tires had rolled over 10 miles of road on the trip to school. Any time one surface moves over another, it causes friction. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are touching, and friction between two surfaces always generates heat. Quickly rub your hands together and you’ll feel the heat generated by the friction between them. As the tires moved over the road, friction between the tires and road generated heat. In short, the tires got warmer and so did the air inside them.  There was a carnival game at the fair that allowed you to win a basketball if you could correctly guess which of the two balls had spun around a circular track more times. Each ball would be dropped into identical circular tracks and then a curtain would cover them. Ball A would then spin around the track a certain amount of times, and Ball B would spin around a certain amount of times. After they were done spinning, you had to guess which ball completed more revolutions. A boy came up and had no idea how to figure out the answer, but when he picked them up he noticed that Ball A was slightly warmer than Ball B.  Which ball completed less revolutions? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, friction generates heat when one surface moves over another. When the boy picked up Ball A and Ball B, he noticed that Ball A was slightly warmer than Ball B. As the warmth of the balls is related to the friction caused by spinning in the circular tracks, we can infer that the ball with more heat would have experienced more friction due to spinning more times. Since Ball A was warmer, it likely completed more revolutions compared to Ball B. Therefore, Ball B completed less revolutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What city contained the Antonia Fortress?  The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.

(1) Staunton answered that he needed more time to prepare , and Morphy wrote to him again : (2) Staunton wrote that he needed more time to prepare , and Morphy replied to him again : Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"No, these two sentences do not mean the exact same thing. They are similar but the roles of the characters Staunton and Morphy are reversed, thus shifting who is taking action and who is responding. In the first sentence: \\"(1) Staunton answered that he needed more time to prepare, and Morphy wrote to him again\\", Staunton is responding to a previous interaction, presumably with Morphy. He expresses his need for more time to prepare, implying there is an event or situation that he's getting ready for that may have been initiated by Morphy. Morphy then continues the conversation or correspondence by writing to Staunton again, perhaps responding to Staunton's request for more preparatory time. On the other hand, the second sentence: \\"(2) Staunton wrote that he needed more time to prepare, and Morphy replied to him again\\", Staunton is the one initiating the communication this time. He writes to Morphy about his need for more time. Morphy responds to this request, indicated by 'replied to him again'.  Therefore, while the dialogue between the two characters Staunton and Morphy and the content about needing more time remains a constant in both cases, the roles they take in continuing their correspondence and initiating the conversation is reversed in both instances. This changes the dynamics and progression of the ongoing dialogue or negotiation between these two individuals, which makes these sentences different in their implications and progression of the storyline. This especially would matter in a context where the sequence of events or whose turn it is to respond has an impact, such as in a game, a real-time negotiation, or a tense discussion.

While it is logical to assume that a successful and accomplished computer scientist may be well-compensated for their work, we do not have the necessary data to compare Sénizergues' salary with those of other professionals in his field. To accurately determine if Géraud Sénizergues is one of the highest paid computer scientists, additional research is required. We would need to gather information about the average salaries for computer scientists in France and internationally, assess the compensation levels of Sénizergues' peers and colleagues, and compare his salary to those figures. Factors such as years of experience, additional roles or responsibilities within the University of Bordeaux, and the specific achievements and qualifications of other computer scientists should also be considered when analyzing salary data. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Géraud Sénizergues is one of the highest paid computer scientists in his field cannot be confirmed as true based solely on the information provided in the paragraph. More research on salaries in the field of computer science is needed to make an accurate determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From the moment I walked in the door, it was apparent that something special was happening here. Firstly, the ambiance was absolutely perfect. The establishment was spotless, with stylish and modern decor, but it managed to maintain a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The soft background music helped create a relaxing environment that set the perfect mood for our dining experience. As for the service, it was truly top-notch. The moment we entered, we were greeted with warm smiles by the hostess who promptly escorted us to our table. Our server was incredibly attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They took the time to answer all our questions about the various dishes on the menu, and their recommendations were spot on! Now, let's talk about the food. It was nothing short of amazing! We started with the appetizers, which were delicious, unique, and beautifully presented. I was particularly impressed with the calamari; it was tender and cooked to perfection, paired with a flavorful dipping sauce that really elevated the dish. For our main courses, we each chose a different entree, and not a single one disappointed. The flavors were well-balanced, the ingredients fresh, and the presentation was visually appealing. A standout dish for me was the seafood pasta; the delicate flavors of each ingredient melded together perfectly to create a dish that was truly unforgettable. Even though we were full from our entrees, we couldn't resist trying a couple of desserts, and I'm happy to report that they were the perfect capstone to a delightful meal. Both the tiramisu and the chocolate lava cake were heavenly, and the portions were generous enough to share. Throughout our time at this wonderful establishment, we never felt rushed or pressured. The staff made sure to check on us regularly and ensured that we had everything we needed. It was evident that customer satisfaction is their top priority, and they go above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and pampered. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this place highly enough!

Movie title: Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior Movie plot: With supplies of petroleum nearly exhausted in the near future following a major energy crisis and a global nuclear war, ex-Main Force Patrol officer \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) roams the now-depopulated and desolate desert in his scarred, black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special several years after the events of the first film, scavenging for food, water, and fuel. His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm â a sawn-off shotgun â for which ammunition is very scarce. While trying to escape a group of gang members â led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez (Vernon Wells) - Max manages to crash two of the gang members' vehicles and injure Wez; recognising his defeat, Wez flees. After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi, Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel. Its pilot, the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered. In exchange for his own life, the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby. Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes. The gang leader, known as \\"Lord Humungus\\" (Kjell Nilsson), tries to convince the refinery's defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area. A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound, but the marauders capture, torture, and kill all but one of them, who is rescued by Max. Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor: he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel. The man dies shortly after they enter the facility, and the facility leader, Pappagallo (Michael Preston), reneges on the deal, saying it died when the survivor died. His group is on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return, and Humungus repeats his offer. When the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) kills Wez's male companion, Wez becomes enraged, urging his leader to take the compound; Humungus wrestles Wez... A:","output":"The facility leader in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is Pappagallo, played by actor Michael Preston. As the leader of the oil refinery, he is responsible for managing the facility and ensuring the safety of the people within it. Pappagallo plays a crucial role in the film as he makes decisions that ultimately affect the community's survival against the marauders, who are trying to seize control of the refinery under the leadership of Lord Humungus. Under Pappagallo's guidance, the refinery's defenders work together to fend off the relentless attacks from Lord Humungus and his gang of marauders. His leadership is tested when Max enters the scene, offering a deal for a tank of fuel. Although Pappagallo reneges on the agreement after the deal's essential component (the mortally wounded survivor) dies, he ultimately reconsiders working with Max to secure the community's safety. Throughout the movie, Pappagallo showcases his tenacity and intelligence when faced with adversity. He ensures the facility's survival and the well-being of its inhabitants, even when it means making difficult decisions. His strategic thinking becomes evident when he collaborates with Max in a daring plan to outwit the marauders. To summarize, the facility leader in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is Pappagallo (Michael Preston), who serves as the central authority figure within the embattled oil refinery and plays a key part in the struggle against Lord Humungus and his marauding gang. Pappagallo's leadership skills and strategic thinking contribute significantly to the film's plot, making his character an integral part of the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage: The German torpedo boat T7 was one of a dozen Type 35 torpedo boats built for the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) during the late 1930s. Completed in 1939, she was not combat ready until mid-1940 when she spent several months escorting minelayers as they laid minefields in the North Sea and the English Channel. The boat participated in an abortive attempt to attack several convoys off the Scottish coast in November. T7 returned to Germany for a refit in January 1941 and then supported operations in the Baltic Sea after the start of Operation Barbarossa in June. The boat was one of the escorts for several commerce raiders passing through the English Channel in late 1941 and then escorted German ships in Norwegian waters in mid-1942. She was briefly placed in reserve later that year and was then reactivated for service with the Torpedo School. T7 was sunk in an air raid in July 1944, but was refloated several months later. She was never repaired and was scrapped in 1947–1949.

Which uncle doesn't take a drug that works slightly differently in many people?  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Almost every child is scared of something, from monsters in the cupboard to dogs in the park. But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias  much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological  . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \\"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\\"scaredy cat\\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \\"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly.

While gazing at the image of a pumpkin patch, a dozen decayed arms punch through the wall clutching at her....She wakes from this surreal horror in the back of a helicopter. She's reminded she is living a real nightmare, looking down over a deserted Florida city, in which they land near an abandoned harbor. She is part of a team searching for survivors of a gruesome crisis that began almost a year earlier, a plague that started mysteriously and eventually collapsed human civilization. Her sometimes lover Miguel, an overworked and nerve-wracked soldier, calls for survivors on a bullhorn as they stand on the edge of the street of this now decaying town. Amid the scattered palm fronds, a newspaper blows in the death-scented wind near an early century federal building. It's big bold headline: THE DEAD WALK! (possibly one of the last papers ever printed).The unburied and/or recently dead have returned to life, attacking humans to devour their flesh, most of them becoming zombies, thus adding to their population. No scientist-no army, could contain or cure it. Now the only living creatures in the outside world are the alligators, tarantulas and land crabs that scavenge remains in the streets of this city of the living dead. The hundreds of wailing hordes of dead humans turn towards the bullhorn calls and en masse, march toward the survivors instinctively like cattle, forcing the team to head back to their sanctuary.The helicopter lands almost out of gas inside the military compound surrounded by wire fence. An army of the living dead have managed to find the post and surround the entrance gates, their numbers growing every day.

The movie \\"Day of the Dead\\" is centered around a zombie apocalypse, where the protagonist Sarah and her team are searching for survivors in a deserted Florida city. As the plot unfolds, it seems like the helicopter is a crucial element for the characters' mobility in a world overrun by zombies, and it helps them escape to their sanctuary. Therefore, it seems that Sarah and her team, which includes her lover Miguel, soldiers Johnson and Torrez, and the calm Jamaican pilot John, plan to use and leave in the helicopter as needed throughout the film. The helicopter serves as a tool for the characters to find and rescue any survivors while avoiding the increasing number of zombies.

When his friends came over for the party, Tim was very worried that he wouldn't get the bike. He looked at all the presents and none of them seemed big enough to have a bike in them. Tim was sad. When it was time to open the presents he opened them one at a time. The first present was not a bike. The second present was not a bike. The third present was the biggest one. Tim knew if the bike was going to be in any of the presents it was going to be in this box. Tim opened it and there was no bike inside.

IOC awards 2018 Olympics to Pyeongchang, South Korea After two unsuccessful bids for the Winter Olympics, Pyeongchang won the right to hold the 2018 Winter Games when 90-plus members of the International Olympic Committee in Durban, South Africa, selected the South Korean city in the first round of voting Wednesday. Pyeongchang soundly defeated Munich and Annecy, France, sending the Winter Games to Asia for the first time since the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. The IOC’s 95 eligible members from 76 countries voted by secret ballot. Pyeongchang won 63 votes; Munich, 25; and Annecy claimed just seven. “We are absolutely delighted,” Cho Yang-ho, the leader of the Korean bid, said during a televised news conference after the announcement. “Over the course of 10 years of bidding, we have been listening and learning from the Olympic family. . . . today our effort and commitment to having the Olympic Games has been rewarded.” When IOC President Jacques Rogge announced the result after opening a sealed envelope in front of representatives from all three cities and the organization’s entire membership, a roar went up from the Pyeongchang contingent. Bid team members leaped, waved South Korean flags, chanted briefly and embraced as representatives from the two other bid cities clapped politely. The last time a city had been selected in the first round was in 1995, when Salt Lake City won the right to hold the 2002 Winter Games. “We understand, of course, [Annecy and Munich] are disappointed,” Rogge said. “But I think there is maybe a lesson . . . patience and perseverance have prevailed.” After losses to Vancouver in the race for the 2010 Winter Games and Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 Olympics, Pyeongchang offered an uncustomary third straight bid. The third-largest city in South Korea, Pyeongchang had actually secured the most votes in the first rounds of its two previous bids, but since it did not receive a majority, the cities that received the lowest number of votes had been eliminated, and voting continued. Rio de Janeiro, which won the right to hold the 2016 Summer Games, bid three times before winning in 2009. “In the past, we think the Olympics are only for rich and big countries,” said Park Yong-sung, the president of the Korean Olympic Committee. “But now Rio, and us, means even those developing countries with good programs and campaigns, they can have the Games in the future.” A 2018 Games in South Korea opens the door to a 2020 Summer Games in Europe and perhaps discourages Tokyo, which has announced plans to contend for that Olympics. Rome has already announced its candidacy and Paris and Madrid could join the field. Scott Blackmun, chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee, has repeatedly said the United States would not offer a bid until its longstanding revenue-sharing dispute with the IOC had been worked out. That seems unlikely in time for the September entry deadline. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and 2010 Olympic figure skating gold medal winner Kim Yu-na participated in Pyeongchang’s formal presentation, which pushed the theme of “new horizons.” Each of the bid cities made an hour-long presentation before the vote. The 1988 Summer Games took place in Seoul, but South Korea has never held a Winter Olympics. Munich, the site of the 1972 Summer Games, was attempting to become the first city to host a winter and summer Olympics. Annecy, considered the outsider in the race, cast itself as an authentic, non-commercialized winter sports center. Pyeongchang relied heavily on the corporate support of Samsung, the emphatic backing of the South Korean government and its reputation for persistence. Munich tried to leverage the insider support of IOC Vice President Thomas Bach of Germany and the general appeal of two-time Olympic champion figure skater Katerina Witt, a key bid team member while declaring the bid about “friendship.” The nation last held a Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1936. Annecy, which struggled at times with bid organization and public support, was attempting to become fourth French city to hold a Winter Olympics. Chamonix held the inaugural Winter Games in 1924; Grenoble played host in 1968; and Albertville, in 1992. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the 2018 Winter Olympics to Pyeongchang, South Korea, during a voting session in Durban, South Africa.

I was in Vegas with my husband and in-laws to have a sin city Christmas. We decided to try Hikari for the AYCE sushi as our Christmas Eve dinner. While our waitress was super sweet and friendly, it didn't make up for the poor service we received over the entire evening. First, we sat down and were asked what we would like to drink (4 hot teas and 4 glasses of water, please) and we excitedly gave the waitress our marked up sushi order so we can get our food ASAP.  10+ minutes pass by and... nothing. The waitress frantically returns and tells us that they must' have lost our sushi order. WHAT. So she asked us to repeat our order by memory, which was really confusing for a second, until I asked her for another menu to look at so we can try to remember. Jeez.  10 minutes later, a big tray of sushi is dropped off by another waitress and is left at the empty side of the counter. We sit and stare at the tray of our sushi for another 10 minutes before our original waitress comes back and brings it to us. I would've served us ourselves, but we weren't sure it was even our food. It was just left there.  As for the food, it was decent. The fried rice and soup were standard but yummy. The rolls were pretty good (I liked the Win Roll... fried with jalapenos) and the sushi and sashimi were just ok. They were cut all weird like they had just been hacked up. I've never seen such poorly cut sushi & sashimi before. And it didn't really taste all that fresh. I know it's not like I expected the freshest and bestest sushi & sashimi ever. But c'mon.  Sad to say I arrived with high hopes and left really frustrated and unsatisfied. I will not be a return customer.  Side note: the chefs put raw meat & seafood on the trays when they do the teppan style dinner. No plates or anything. Just raw chicken, shrimp, and steaks on plastic lunch trays. The same trays they bring out your other food on. I hope they wash those with really hot water. Ew. Choose the sentiment of this review?

Given the question: Information:  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489).  - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current.  - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack.  - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others .  - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.  - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia.  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes.  - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\".    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'masters of the hemisphere ' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'.

Solve this instance: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the \`\`Colorado Forest Insect Emergency  Response Act of 2008''. SEC. 2. RESPONSE TO SEVERE INFESTATIONS OF BARK BEETLES AND OTHER                INSECTS ON FEDERAL LAND IN COLORADO.     (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:             (1) Fire and bark beetles and other insects that feed on          trees are natural parts of Colorado's forest ecology that have          some beneficial effects and help shape the forests by thinning          dense tree stands and promoting cyclical re-growth.             (2) However, in various parts of Colorado, large-scale          infestations of bark beetles and other insects, in combination          with other factors, have increased the likelihood of unusually          severe wildfires that pose a threat to lives and property in          nearby communities and to municipal water supplies and other          infrastructure.             (3) The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law          108-148; 16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) was enacted to address the          need to reduce the volume of fuel that can feed the most severe          wildfires that threaten communities.             (4) The modification of some provisions of the Healthy          Forests Restoration Act of 2003 will help to further expedite          action to reduce the risks of severe wildfires to Colorado          communities, water supplies, and infrastructure in or near          forested areas most severely affected by infestations of bark          beetles and other insects.     (b) Insect-Emergency Area Defined.--Section 101 of the Healthy  Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511) is amended--             (1) by redesignating paragraphs (12) through (16) as          paragraphs (13) through (17), respectively; and             (2) by inserting after paragraph (11) the following new          paragraph:             \`\`(12) Insect-emergency area.--The term \`insect-emergency          area' means an area of Federal land in Colorado designated by          the Secretary pursuant to section 107.''.     (c) Alternative Analysis Process.--Section 104(d)(2) of the Healthy  Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6514(d)(2)) is amended by  inserting after \`\`at-risk community'' the following: \`\`or on any other  lands identified for such a project in a community wildfire protection  plan for an at-risk community in or adjacent to an insect-emergency  area''.     (d) Response to Insect Emergencies.--Title I of the Healthy Forests  Restoration Act of 2003 is amended--             (1) by redesignating sections 107 and 108 as sections 108          and 109, respectively; and             (2) by inserting after section 106 (16 U.S.C. 6516) the          following new section: \`\`SEC. 107. COLORADO INSECT-EMERGENCY AREAS.     \`\`(a) Designation of Insect-Emergency Areas.--             \`\`(1) Designation authority.--The Secretary may designate          an area of Federal land in Colorado as an insect-emergency area          if--                     \`\`(A) the Secretary determines that the area is                  subject to a widespread infestation of bark beetles or                  other insects;                     \`\`(B) the Secretary determines that the area is                  characterized by insect-induced tree mortality that                  has, or within one year of the determination will have,                  produced a condition such that an immediate reduction                  in hazardous fuels is required in order to reduce the                  risks to human life and property or to a municipal                  water supply from a severe wildfire; and                     \`\`(C) the area is identified for hazardous fuel                  reduction treatment in a community wildfire protection                  plan.             \`\`(2) Criteria.--The determinations required by          subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) shall be made on the          basis of the best information available, including observation          of relevant insect infestations.             \`\`(3) Limitation on delegation.--In the case of National          Forest System lands, the authority to designate an insect-         emergency area may be delegated only to a Regional Forester.     \`\`(b) Initiation of Designation Process.--             \`\`(1) Initiation.--The designation of an insect-emergency          area may be made on the initiative of the Secretary or in          response to a request by any agency of the State of Colorado or          a political subdivision thereof.             \`\`(2) Deadline.--If a request for designation is initiated          by the State or a political subdivision thereof, the Secretary          shall issue a decision regarding the request not later than 90          days after receipt of the request.     \`\`(c) Consultation and Public Comment.--Before making the  determinations required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1)  of subsection (a) with respect to an area, the Secretary shall--             \`\`(1) consult with any Federal agency responsible for          management of lands within a relevant community wildfire          protection plan and appropriate State and local officials; and             \`\`(2) provide public notice and seek public comments on the          possible determinations.     \`\`(d) Review of Designation.--Any administrative or judicial review  of the decision of the Secretary to designate an insect-emergency area  shall be subject to regulations issued pursuant to section 105 and to  the provisions of section 106.     \`\`(e) Authorized Hazardous Fuel Reduction Projects in Designated  Areas.--An authorized hazardous fuel reduction project involving only  lands within an insect-emergency area may be categorically excluded  from documentation in an environmental impact statement and  environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act of  1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) if--             \`\`(1) the project involves only lands that are identified          for hazardous-fuel reduction treatment in a community wildfire          protection plan; and             \`\`(2) the decision to categorically exclude the project is          made in accordance with applicable extraordinary circumstances          procedures established pursuant to section 1508.4 of title 40,          Code of Federal Regulations.''.

If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff.

If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).

The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going to a concert where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk. He instructs Gurumoorthy to leave the premises and performs in the concert without the use of Mridangam which is considered a basic/compulsory instrument to perform a carnatic concert. When Gurumoorthy is asked to permanently leave the band, he promises not to drink again. While Bhairavi's grandfather is going to receive his pension, which he does on the first of every month, Gajapathi lies to him that his pension has been cancelled. The old man starts crying and JKB intervenes to confirm that his pension is not canceled and that he can go and collect it. JKB then scolds Gajapathi for it and tells him the old man could have died on hearing such a lies, as he is very particular about his pension. Following this, when JKB finds out that Gajapathi has lied to him too and others causing problems he asks him to promise to speak the truth. Sindhu (Suhasini), working as a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is performing a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead of listening to the music.

Write a summary based on this article: THE results are in and the conclusion is overwhelming: left-handed people are 71% more satisfied in bed than right-handed people. So say the results of intimate lifestyle products company, LELO’s 2014 Global Sex Survey.      When asked about their sex life in a survey of 10,000 people, 86% of left-handed people reported that they were “Extremely Satisfied” as compared to only 15% of right-handed people.      Who knows what the reason is for this. Maybe because the left-handed are forced to find solutions for living in a world predominantly created for the right-handed, they develop a stronger sense of ingenuity and that same ingenuity transfers to the bedroom? Just a theory.      In light of these surprising results, LELO has designed a new sex toy that aims to give the North paws a little taste of the South paw sex drive.      BEST COMPLIMENTS TO GIVE A WOMAN      It is fittingly titled DEXTRUS and is the first sex toy that claims it will increase your sexual pleasure as well as make you smarter. Even crazier, the way it works, you could use it in front of a crowded room of people without getting sued for indecent exposure. The sex toy is shaped like a stress ball and used similarly: When the user squeezes the ball with their left-hand, vibrations are sent up the arm, stimulating the right side of the brain. This is based on findings from a study conducted last April that “test[ed] effects of unilateral hand clenching on episodic memory” and found that “left hand clenching (right hemisphere activation) pre-recall,...result[s] in superior memory.” The idea is to get right-handed people to stimulate the supposed lesser-used right side of their brain by activating the stimulating vibrations with their left hand.      This is not the first time people have tried to use “good vibrations” to stimulate the brain. Researches have also experimented with magnetic stimulation and ultrasound stimulation to cure certain types of depression with some degree of success.      So where does the sex part come in? The creators of DEXTRUS suggest using the toy similarly in the bedroom to tap in to the left-handed sexual mentality. You can also just use it all over the body as a regular vibrator, but you’re probably going to want to wash it off before bringing it back into work the next day...

The wonders of technology help to bring people together, but is it also a key factor in keeping them apart? With today's couples interacting with their devices more than each other, could gadgets and gizmos be the main reason behind the fact that people are having 20% less sex than in 2000*?      20% of US 18-34 year olds have admitted to having used a smartphone during sex (Harris Interactive) and Twitter users on average have shorter relationships than non users (OK Cupid) - is tech just turning us off?      A recent poll for Durex (OnePoll) on the UK's sex life revealed shocking statistics including 12% of people had answered a phone during sex, one in ten had read a text and over 5% of respondents had even checked Facebook while making love.      Durex believes nothing should get in the way of great sex. So let's log off and switch off. Escape the screen to embrace the dark. This Earth Hour, let's take the opportunity to reconnect while the lights are off.      As a call to action, Durex is releasing a short film which follows the stories of several couples who, like most of us, have become distracted by the lure of a screen. The short film can be viewed on YouTube beginning March 19, 2014 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6VPUTtuKuk #turnofftoturnon.      By not only turning off all lights on March 29, 2014, but also switching off all gadgets and gizmos, people can use this opportunity as an excuse to swap their laptops for some loving and ditch their phones to enjoy some foreplay.      Ukonwa Ojo, who leads Global Brand Equity Marketing for Durex says: \\"Earth Hour provides the perfect opportunity for couples to switch off for an hour and focus exclusively on reconnecting with each other. What else is as much fun to do in the dark that is as energy efficient as it is energetic?!\\"      \\"Earth Hour is a great, yet rare excuse for couples to give each other their undivided attention. With over 80 years bedroom experience, Durex knows physical touch and intimacy are extremely important for feeling connected in your relationship,\\" said Aurore Trepo, marketing director, Durex USA. \\"And with recent survey research revealing our smartphones get more attention than our partners, we want to encourage all of America to turn off and get turned on for March 29. Durex offers everything from lubricants to personal massagers to ensure that when the lights go out couples will be so busy they'll forget to switch the power back on!\\"      This film is a passionate plea to escape the screen and embrace the physical.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world.      Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.”      Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness.      They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution.      Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness.      The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.      “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science.      “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.”      If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction.      The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level.      Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world.      Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports.      On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this.      “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says.      Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness.      “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says.      “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.”      The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research. ||||| Share ! tweet                  (*Exclusively for Right-Handed People)      The following article is from our 2014 April Fool’s joke that appeared in hundreds of international news outlets all over the world. Please enjoy this ‘launch’ of the world’s first vibrator that can make you a smarter person — but only if you’re right handed!      Explosive new findings for the LELO Global Sex Survey have shown left-handed people are not only more creative and intelligent than right-handers (who make up 90% of the global population), they are also up to 71% more sexually satisfied!      To level the playing field and change the world at the same time, LELO is thrilled to announce the launch of ‘DEXTRÜS’ – the first ever vibrator that makes you smart – exclusively for right handed people.      How DEXTRÜS will change the world!      LELO’s survey results, as verified by Le Gauche Institute, Paris, showed 86% of left-handed respondents claim to be ‘Extremely Satisfied’ with their sex lives, compared to only 15% of right-handed people. That’s because left-handers receive pleasure from the right-side of the brain, which is responsible for more artistic, creative and sensual thinking. Right-handers, on the other hand, experience pleasure through the linear, analytical and logical left side of the brain.      Not only is LELO’s survey showing the first ever link between sexual satisfaction and handedness, it also complements an earlier April 2013 study from Ruth Propper and colleagues at Montclair State University, which highlighted the benefits of right-handers using their left hands for various actions.      LELO has since partnered with scientists from Sinister College, Oxford, to launch the world’s first ‘right-handed vibrator’, used in the left hand, for pleasure and smartness combined.      How DEXTRÜS works:      TO MAKE YOU SMARTER: LELO’s new DEXTRÜS vibrator is set to be the first ever sex toy to penetrate the modern work-place, as users squeeze the silicone shell during meetings to enhance their natural spontaneity.

While I can count on one hand how many right-handed people I know – only a handful, really – I’ve got to say, it feels pretty good to lend them a hand.”      SHARE THE GOOD NEWS!      Do you have right-handed friends that could to be a little smarter, more spontaneous, or even more satisfied at the same time? Support LELO’s DEXTRÜS project and share the love below: |||||","output":"Here's a more simple explanation: A company named LELO did a big survey or study in 2014. They asked 10,000 people lots of questions about how satisfied they were with their intimate or private lives. The surprising result was 86% of left-handed people, or people who use their left hand more than their right hand, said they were \\"extremely satisfied\\". But, only 15% of the right-handed people said the same thing.  People have some theories why this might be true. Maybe it's because left-handed people have to think more creatively because most things are made for right-handed people. This creativity could then also make their private lives better.  The company LELO used this information to design a new toy called DEXTRUS that can stimulate the right part of our brains. It looks like a stress ball and sends out vibrations when you squeeze it with your left hand. The toy is supposed to make right-handed people use the right parts of their brains more, just like the left-handed people do. Separately, another company called Durex is suggesting we should all turn off our gadgets and devices for Earth Hour, to focus more on our loved ones and improve our private lives. They found that too much device use is causing people to have less physical affection compared to 20 years ago.  Scientists also believe that left-handedness is rare because it shows a balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The fact that only 10% of human population is left-handed could be because our societies value cooperation or people working together more than competition or people working against each other. For example, many sports teams have more left-handed players because sports often involve competition.  In short, whether it's because of using certain parts of the brain more or because we evolved to cooperate better, these studies suggest that left-handed people often report being more satisfied in their private lives. But, all of us, no matter if we're left-handed or right-handed, can work on improving our happiness and satisfaction too!"},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. Question: Why the disappointed father was angry? Answer: Answer:","output":"The disappointed father was angry because his child did not get accepted into the Part-time Evening Elementary School, and he believed that only children of VIPs (wealthy and influential people) were accepted into the school."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. she brings this energy with her into c3, when she delivers training in danish culture, general cultural awareness and global team development. How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","output":"The correctly capitalized sentence should read: \\"She brings this energy with her into C3, when she delivers training in Danish culture, general cultural awareness and global team development.\\"  Here's the detailed explanation: 1. \\"She\\" starts with a capital \\"S\\" because it is the first word of the sentence. This is the basic rule that the first word of any sentence starts with a capital letter.     2. The term \\"C3\\" is already capitalized correctly as it most likely refers to a certain organization, company, project or place, which are types of proper nouns that need to be capitalized. 3. \\"Danish\\" is capitalized because it is used as a descriptor for \\"culture\\" and it refers to a specific nationality or country—Denmark. Country names and adjectives derived from them are always capitalized in English. 4. All other words in the sentence are not capitalized because they are common nouns or they don't fall under any category that requires capitalization per English grammar rules. Words like \\"culture,\\" \\"awareness,\\" and \\"team\\" are all common nouns and thus don't require capitalization unless they start a sentence or are part of a title or proper noun. Similarly, \\"and,\\" \\"in,\\" and \\"when\\" are a conjunction, preposition, and subordinating conjunction respectively, and these types of words are typically not capitalized in sentences unless they're the first word.  5. The word \\"global\\" is a descriptive adjective for \\"team development\\" and doesn't need to be capitalized because English rules do not require adjectives to be capitalized unless they are a part of a title, proper noun, or start a sentence. 6. Finally, the period at the end of the sentence is properly placed to indicate the end of the sentence.  So, to conclude, capitalization rules in English state that the first word of each sentence, names of specific entities or proper nouns, and adjectives derived from proper nouns need to be capitalized in a sentence. All other words do not generally require capitalization unless they start a sentence or are part of a title or proper noun. Therefore, this is the corrected version of the sentence: \\"She brings this energy with her into C3, when she delivers training in Danish culture, general cultural awareness and global team development.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Book store: Although people can discuss and analyze poetry in a book store, it is not necessarily the most likely place for younger people to analyze a poet. 2. University: Universities are known for hosting discussions and analysis sessions on various topics, including poetry. This could be a possible location for younger people to analyze a poet. 3. Home: Homes can be a setting for gatherings and discussions, but are not typically the primary place where younger people would analyze a poet. 4. Classroom: Classrooms are another strong possibility, as teachers often lead discussions and analyze poets with younger people as part of their curriculum. 5. Speakeasy: A speakeasy is a hidden or secret establishment that sells alcohol, which is not typically a place where younger people would analyze a poet. Based on the analysis above, the most likely locations for the poet to be analyzed by younger people would be a university or a classroom.

Answer the following question: Like many other inventors before him, professor Slawomir Suwak designed only the things he needed himself. He had several patents on his conscience already: an automatic cork opener for wine in the indicative state, a portable set of board games for solving personality problems, a wallet with a mini-device for the duplications of 100 zloty bills, and a piece of equipment \\"the day after\\" used to irretrievably eliminate from the time-space continuum days burdened with a hangover. Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood. Professor Suwak called his new baby \\"mini-anti-aggressor.\\" The McPhilips corporation expressed its interest in the product early on, even when it was still at the drawing-board stage. The company partially financed the purchase of sub-assembly elements from its subsidiary specializing in the productions of components for technologically advanced products.

While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' jealous brother Hades plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus. Turning to the Fates for help, Hades learns that in eighteen years, a planetary alignment will allow Hades to locate and free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his minions Pain and Panic to dispose of Hercules. The two succeed at kidnapping and feeding him a formula that turns him mortal, but fail to remove his superhuman strength before Hercules is found and adopted by the farmers Amphitryon and Alcmene. Years later, the teenaged Hercules becomes an outcast due to his strength, and wonders where he came from. After his foster parents reveal the necklace they found him with, Hercules decides to visit the temple of Zeus for answers.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. Employees feel frustration as: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Directors follow a stringent hierarchy  B. a new SVP is hired  C. not enough information  D. The organization grows and divides A:","output":"C. not enough information The frustration within organizations often arises due to not enough information being shared and a lack of communication between different levels of hierarchy. As an organization grows, maintaining open channels of communication and ensuring that all employees feel engaged and valued can become increasingly challenging. However, this can be addressed with relatively simple solutions that promote a more transparent and inclusive environment. One approach is to create spaces and opportunities for employees to voice their ideas, concerns, and opinions. Encouraging a culture of open dialogue and feedback across all levels of the organization can help in bridging the gap between senior management and other employees. Regular town hall meetings, skip-level meetings, and suggestion boxes are some ways to achieve this. Another method to improve the organizational dynamic is to implement a flatter management structure that minimizes bureaucracy and empowers decision-making at lower levels. This can lead to increased innovation, productivity, and employee satisfaction, as individuals feel more involved in shaping the organization's future. Additionally, providing ongoing training and development opportunities can play a crucial role in fostering employee engagement. By investing in employees' growth, organizations demonstrate their commitment to the workforce and create a sense of shared responsibility and ownership. Moreover, recognizing and rewarding the contributions of employees helps in boosting morale, increasing motivation, and ensuring that their efforts are acknowledged and valued. Implementing both formal and informal recognition programs can have a significant impact on employees' job satisfaction and, in turn, on organizational success. In summary, while it is common for organizations to experience challenges as they grow, fostering a culture of open communication, employee engagement, and empowerment can help bridge the gap between leadership and employees. Providing transparent information flow, enabling decision-making at all levels, investing in employee development, and recognizing achievements are key ingredients to creating an inclusive and dynamic organization where both leaders and followers can thrive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the context: How would Others feel as a result?  Possible answers: are shrewd and tactful with her money and tenants, put out, are strict and miserly towards the tenants The answer to this question is:","output":"As a result, others might feel that Bailey is being strict and miserly towards the tenants since she is unwilling to provide any financial relief or understanding in regards to their rent payments. Elaborating on the possible answers, we can analyze how people could perceive Bailey's actions from different perspectives: 1. Shrewd and tactful with her money and tenants: Some people may view Bailey in a positive light, admiring her ability to handle her finances effectively. They might consider her as a person who is conscious about her financial responsibilities, like paying taxes, and ensuring that her tenants are equally responsible for their rent payments. In this case, people could perceive Bailey as a business-minded individual who prioritizes her financial stability over cutting tenants any breaks. 2. Put out: On the other hand, some people may feel put out by Bailey's actions as she is unwilling to offer any leniency towards her tenants. This could make them question her empathy and compassion as a landlord, especially if the tenants are going through difficult financial situations themselves. People with this perspective may think that Bailey prioritizes her interests above the wellbeing of her tenants, creating a sense of discontent and frustration. 3. Strict and miserly towards the tenants: The majority of people might consider Bailey as being overly strict and miserly towards her tenants due to her inflexibility in providing any financial assistance or understanding. This perception could lead to the belief that she is focused solely on protecting her assets rather than nurturing a supportive and understanding landlord-tenant relationship. People with this viewpoint may perceive Bailey as a cold-hearted individual who lacks compassion for the human element in her business dealings. In conclusion, Bailey's actions of not cutting her tenants any breaks in order to pay taxes can create mixed feelings among others. Some may appreciate her attention to financial matters and consider her a responsible landlord, while others may be frustrated and perceive her as strict, miserly, and lacking empathy for her tenants' situations. Ultimately, the perception of Bailey's actions would depend on individual values and beliefs around responsibility, empathy, and the role of a landlord in supporting their tenants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Identify the blind Norse god involved in the story The blind Norse god who shot Balder was Höðr, also known as Hodr or Hother. Step 2: Determine the circumstances of Balder's death In Norse mythology, Balder was the son of Odin and Frigg and was known for his beauty, gentleness, and wisdom. Balder had a dream warning him of his impending death. Upon discussing this with his mother Frigg, she made everything in the world swear an oath not to harm Balder. However, Frigg overlooked the mistletoe.  Loki, the god of mischief, learned of this vulnerability and crafted a dart or an arrow from mistletoe. He then approached Höðr, who was blind, and offered to assist him in joining the gods' games, where they were throwing various objects at Balder, knowing they couldn't harm him. Loki guided Höðr's hand, and together, they shot the mistletoe-tipped arrow at Balder, killing him instantly.

Susan ate yesterday at the restaurant. OPT: + unacceptable; + acceptable;","output":"A linguist would find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically: Susan ate yesterday at the restaurant. This sentence could be labeled as \\"acceptable.\\" Let's analyze it according to standard English grammar rules. The sentence consists of a subject (Susan), a verb (ate), an adverb indicating the time (yesterday), and a prepositional phrase indicating the place (at the restaurant). The sentence adheres to the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is common in standard English. 1. Subject: Susan    The subject of the sentence is \\"Susan,\\" which is a proper noun representing a person. This satisfies the requirement for a subject in a grammatically correct English sentence. 2. Verb: ate    The verb \\"ate\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to eat.\\" This verb is transitive, meaning it requires an object to complete its meaning. However, in this sentence, the object is implied and not explicitly stated. In context, the sentence means that Susan ate something (most likely a meal) at the restaurant. The missing object is due to ellipsis, which is a grammatical feature that omits redundant information. This is acceptable in English as long as the missing information can be inferred from the context. 3. Adverb: yesterday    The adverb \\"yesterday\\" modifies the verb \\"ate\\" and indicates the time when the action took place. Placement of adverbs in English can be flexible, and it is acceptable to place an adverb of time between the subject and the verb or after the verb. 4. Prepositional Phrase: at the restaurant    The prepositional phrase \\"at the restaurant\\" consists of a preposition (\\"at\\") and a noun phrase (\\"the restaurant\\"). This phrase provides additional information about the location where the action took place and is a common way to denote location in English. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Susan ate yesterday at the restaurant\\" is grammatically acceptable in English, as it consists of a subject, verb, adverb, and prepositional phrase in a structure that adheres to standard English rules. The missing object, which can be inferred from context, is due to ellipsis, a common feature in the English language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities—such as velocity—so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.

The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose first venture was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public? from the following article ?  The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was  written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany.  When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill –  the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the  early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music  changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\".  In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and  masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind.

Do these questions have the same meaning? How does a catabolic and an anabolic pathway differ? What are the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways? Choose from: *no; *yes;","output":"Yes, the two questions essentially have the same meaning, as they both ask for the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways. Here is a detailed and comprehensive comparison of catabolic and anabolic pathways: 1. Definition: Catabolic pathways (catabolism) involve the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, whereas anabolic pathways (anabolism) involve the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler precursors. 2. Energy: Catabolic pathways release energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) or other high-energy molecules, while anabolic pathways generally require the input of energy in the form of ATP to synthesize the new molecules. 3. Function: The primary function of catabolic pathways is to provide energy and building blocks needed for cellular processes, while anabolic pathways function to maintain and create cellular structures and biochemical molecules that are necessary for the growth and repair of cells and tissues. 4. Chemical Reactions: Catabolic reactions are typically exergonic, which means they release energy, while anabolic reactions are often endergonic, requiring the input of energy to proceed. 5. Enzymes: Different types of enzymes catalyze catabolic and anabolic reactions. Catabolic enzymes, often called hydrolases, break down large molecules, while anabolic enzymes, commonly referred to as synthases, facilitate the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller precursors. 6. Examples of Processes: Catabolic processes include digestion of food, glycolysis (breaking down glucose to generate ATP), and cellular respiration. Anabolic processes include protein synthesis, DNA replication, and the synthesis of lipids and carbohydrates. 7. Hormones: Key hormones regulate catabolic and anabolic processes. Examples of hormones that promote catabolism include cortisol, glucagon, and adrenaline. Hormones that favor anabilosm include insulin, growth hormone, and testosterone. 8. Cellular Location: Catabolic and anabolic pathways may occur in different cellular locations within a cell. For example, glycolysis, a catabolic pathway, occurs in the cytoplasm, while the synthesis of fatty acids, an anabolic pathway, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum. 9. Significance in Metabolism: Catabolic and anabolic pathways work in coordination to maintain the balance between the breakdown of substances and their synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining optimal health and homeostasis in an organism. In conclusion, while the two questions have the same meaning, it is essential to understand the various aspects that differentiate catabolic and anabolic pathways, including their molecular processes, energy requirements, and hormonal regulation. The balance between the two pathways is crucial for overall metabolic homeostasis and health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How do you do this: How to properly clean a piece of pork?","output":"To properly clean a piece of pork, follow these steps: Step 1: Gather necessary items - Obtain a cutting board, preferably one used specifically for raw meats - Have a sharp knife ready - Collect paper towels or clean cloth towels - Prepare a clean working surface - Make sure to have a sink with running water (cold or cool water is ideal) Step 2: Inspect the pork Before cleaning, examine the pork for any signs of spoilage, including off odors, sliminess, or an unusual color. If any of these signs are present, discard the pork as it may be unsafe to consume. If the pork appears to be fresh, proceed to the next step. Step 3: Remove excess fat and connective tissue Place the pork on the cutting board. Using a sharp knife, carefully trim away any excess fat or silver skin (thin, silvery membrane) on the pork. Keep both the pork and the cutting board away from other foods or surfaces to avoid cross-contamination. Step 4: Rinse the pork Hold the pork under cold running water, gently rubbing the surface to remove any dirt, stray hairs, or small bone fragments. It's important to note that rinsing is a controversial step, as it can potentially spread bacteria to other surfaces. Some people prefer to pat the pork dry instead. If you choose to rinse, be sure to clean and sanitize your sink and surrounding area afterward. Step 5: Pat the pork dry After rinsing, use paper towels or a clean cloth towel to gently pat the pork dry. This step helps remove any remaining surface bacteria and also allows for more even cooking. Step 6: Dispose of any trimmings Dispose of the used paper towels, fat, and connective tissues in a trash bag. Wash and sanitize the knife and cutting board, as well as any other utensils or surfaces used during the cleaning process. Step 7: Store or prepare the pork Immediately cook the clean pork, or store it in the refrigerator (at a temperature below 40°F/4°C) wrapped in plastic or butcher paper until you are ready to cook it. It is best to use or freeze the pork within a day or two. By following these steps, you can ensure that you are properly cleaning a piece of pork in a safe, hygienic manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. After Pete angrily blows up Cooley's police van, Wash's son helps them escape. Pete and Delmar are baptized by a group of Christians at a river. The group then picks up Tommy Johnson, a young black man, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit.

He also fronted his own Michigan-based bands, the Frost and the Bossmen.  - Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spans over five decades. With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, deadly snakes, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be \\"The Godfather of Shock Rock\\". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people.   - Vaudeville is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment. It was especially popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s. A typical vaudeville performance is made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and movies. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a \\"vaudevillian\\".  - Garage rock (shortened as \\"garage\\"; sometimes '60s punk\\" or \\"garage punk\\") is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada. The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional. The phrase \\"garage band\\" is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre.  - Music Rising is a charity co-founded by Producer Bob Ezrin, U2's The Edge and Gibson Guitar CEO Henry Juszkiewicz. Launched in November 2005 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the foundation aims to help in the purchasing of new instruments for the musicians of New Orleans affected by the disaster.  - 7th Level was a video game development company based in Dallas, Texas and founded in 1993. The company was most famous for developing the three Monty Python games (with the aid of Python member Eric Idle), \\"G-Nome\\" (1997)  a \\"MechWarrior\\"-style game, for publishing \\"Helicops\\" (1997)  an anime-inspired arcade-style aerial combat game, and for \\"Tracer\\"  a game of hacking distributed computer systems for cash using a virtual avatar in the design of \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Shadowrun\\", or \\"Snowcrash\\" styled virtual worlds.  - Welcome to My Nightmare is the eighth studio album by Alice Cooper, released in March 1975. This was Alice Cooper's first solo album (all previous Alice Cooper releases were band efforts), and his only album for the Atlantic Records label. The ensuing tour was one of the most over-the-top excursions of that era. Most of Lou Reeds band joined Cooper for this record.  - Lewis Allan \\"Lou\\" Reed (March 2, 1942  October 27, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was the guitarist, vocalist, and principal songwriter of the Velvet Underground, and his solo career spanned five decades. The Velvet Underground was unsuccessful during their active years, but gained a significant cult following to become one of the most widely acclaimed and influential bands in rock history. Brian Eno famously stated that, while the Velvet Underground's debut album sold only 30,000 copies, \\"everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band\\".  - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.  - The Frost was an American psychedelic rock band from Alpena, Michigan in the late 1960s, led by singer-guitarist, Dick Wagner, who went on to play with Ursa Major, Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, David Bowie, Dan Page and Kevin Ulgenalp in the 1970s. The rest of the band consisted of Gordy Garris (bass guitar), Bob Rigg (drums), and Don Hartman (guitar).  - Alice Cooper Goes to Hell is the ninth studio album by Alice Cooper , released in 1976 . A continuation of Welcome to My Nightmare as it continues the story of Steven , this concept album was written almost exclusively by Cooper with guitar player Dick Wagner and producer Bob Ezrin . With the success of \`\` Only Women Bleed '' from his first solo effort , Alice continued with the rock ballads on this album . \`\` I Never Cry '' was written about his drinking problem , which would in one year send the performer into rehab and affect all his subsequent music up to and including 1983 's DaDa . Cooper called the song \`\` an alcoholic confession '' . The \`\` Alice Cooper Goes To Hell '' tour of 1976 was completely cancelled prior to commencement due to Cooper suffering from anemia at the time . However , \`\` Go to Hell '' proved the last song until his big hit \`\` Poison '' to become a consistent part of Cooper 's live setlists , being performed on most tours to the present . \`\` I Never Cry '' was also regularly performed in the late 1970s and during the 2000s , whilst \`\` Guilty '' was performed regularly on the Flush the Fashion and Special Forces tours and occasionally during the 2000s and \`\` Wish You Were Here '' frequently played on the tours for the following two albums . In 2005 the first track , \`\` Go to Hell '' , was featured as the theme song to the sixth episode of Lucy , the Daughter of the Devil titled \`\` Human Sacrifice '' .

Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres.  - Deftones is an American alternative metal band from Sacramento, California, U.S. Formed in 1988, the band was founded by Chino Moreno (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Stephen Carpenter (lead guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums) and Dominic Garcia (bass). During the group's first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined the group after his departure in 1990. Cunningham replaced John Taylor, who had replaced Garcia after he had switched to drums in 1990, and the bassist role had been filled by Chi Cheng. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist Frank Delgado being added in 1999. In 2008, Cheng was involved in an automobile accident that ended his stint with Deftones and eventually took his life in 2013. He has been replaced by Sergio Vega. The band is known as one of the most experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal music scene.  - Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years.

Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \\"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\\". They were listed in the 1975 \\"Guinness Book of World Records\\" as \\"the globe's loudest band\\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.  - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - Phish is a band known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base.

It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole.  - Philanthropy (from Greek ) means etymologically, the love of humanity, in the sense of caring, nourishing, developing, and enhancing what it means to be human. In this meaning, it involves both the benefactor in their identifying and exercising their values, and the beneficiary in their receipt and benefit from the service or goods provided. A conventional modern definition is \\"private initiatives, for the public good, focusing on quality of life,\\" which combines an original humanistic tradition with a social scientific aspect developed in the 20th century. The definition also serves to contrast philanthropy with \\"business\\" endeavors, which are private initiatives for private good, e.g., focusing on material gain, and with \\"government\\" endeavors, which are public initiatives for public good, e.g., focusing on provision of public services. A person who practices philanthropy is called a philanthropist.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - Thirty Seconds to Mars (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band consists of Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), Shannon Leto (drums, percussion) and Tomo Milievi (lead guitar, bass, violin, keyboards, other instruments).  - The Devil (from Greek:  or \\"diábolos\\" slanderer or accuser) is, according to Christianity and Islam, the primary opponent of God.  - Peter Brian Gabriel (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer-songwriter, musician and humanitarian activist who rose to fame as the original lead singer and flautist of the progressive rock band Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, Gabriel launched a solo career, with \\"Solsbury Hill\\" his first single. His 1986 album, \\"So\\", is his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the U.S. The album's most successful single, \\"Sledgehammer\\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards and remains the most played music video in the history of MTV.  - Robert Alan \\"Bob\\" Ezrin (born March 25, 1949) is a Canadian music producer and keyboardist, best known for his work with Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Peter Gabriel, and Phish. As of 2010, Ezrin's career in music had spanned four decades and his production work continued into the 21st century, with acts such as Deftones and Thirty Seconds to Mars. After co-founding interactive media company, 7th Level, in 1993, Ezrin has branched out into philanthropy and activism, with music also introduced into this realm of his life, underpinning projects such as Music Rising and Young Artists for Haiti. Ezrin is also involved in education, co-founding the Nimbus School of Recording Arts in 2009.  - Interactive media normally refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the users actions by presenting content such as text, moving image, animation, video, audio, and video games.  - A keyboardist is a musician who plays keyboard instruments. Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either pianists or organists. Since the mid-1960s, a plethora of new musical instruments with keyboards have come into common usage, requiring a more general term for a person who plays them. These keyboards include:  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.

Title: Mother and Son Movie plot: The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died.

Everytime I get close to a girl, I push them away due to a lack of self esteem, what can I do to gain confidence with girls?","output":"While the two questions appear to be related to self-confidence issues, they do not have the exact same meaning. The first question is a broader inquiry about managing shyness and building general self-confidence, while the second question is more specific, focusing on self-confidence in the context of romantic relationships and interactions with the opposite gender. Let's discuss both questions in detail. 1. How do I control my shy nature and gain self-confidence? To control your shy nature and boost your self-confidence, consider the following steps: a. Self-reflection: First, identify the root cause of your shyness and lack of self-confidence. Is it due to past experiences, negative thoughts, or social anxiety? Understanding the underlying cause of your shyness is the first step in addressing the issue. b. Avoid comparing yourself to others: Focus on your own personal development and growth rather than dwelling on the accomplishments or characteristics of others. Constant comparison can lead to low self-esteem and decreased confidence. c. Develop positive self-talk: Cultivate positive affirmations and self-talk to counteract any negative thoughts. This helps in rewiring your brain to think more positively about yourself and boosts your self-esteem. d. Set personal goals: Set achievable goals for yourself and work towards them. As you accomplish your goals, you'll naturally feel more confident in your abilities. e. Embrace failure: Don't shy away from trying new things because you're afraid of failure. Embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process and use each failure as an opportunity for self-improvement. f. Practice social skills: Engage in social activities and practice these skills to overcome your shyness. It may be helpful to start with small, informal gatherings before moving to larger events or more intimidating social situations. g. Work on body language: Improve your body language by standing tall, making eye contact, and offering a genuine smile. This nonverbal communication will not only make you appear more confident but also make you feel more confident. h. Seek professional help: If necessary, consider seeking advice from a professional therapist or counselor, who can provide valuable guidance and support in your journey to overcome shyness and improve self-confidence. 2. Every time I get close to a girl, I push them away due to a lack of self-esteem, what can I do to gain confidence with girls? To gain confidence in your interactions with girls, you can take the following steps: a. Enhance general self-confidence: First and foremost, work on improving your overall self-confidence (as discussed in response to your first question), as this can automatically have a positive effect on your interactions with girls. b. Build genuine connections: Focus on getting to know the girl as a person rather than as a potential romantic partner. This will help alleviate some pressure and allow you to build a genuine connection based on common interests and shared experiences. c. Improve communication skills: Practice active listening, maintain eye contact, and project your voice clearly and calmly. This shows that you're engaged in the conversation and helps in establishing a positive rapport. d. Get out of your comfort zone: Put yourself in social situations where you're likely to interact with girls and build your confidence in various contexts, such as parties, clubs, workshops, or even online. e. Practice empathy: Try to understand and empathize with the feelings of the girl you're interacting with. This will make your conversations more meaningful and show that you genuinely care about her thoughts and emotions. f. Accept and embrace rejection: Understand that rejection is a natural part of any interaction and doesn't define your worth. Learn from rejection and use it to improve your communication skills. g. Seek guidance from friends or mentors: Talk to friends or trusted mentors who have more experience in building successful relationships with the opposite gender. They can offer valuable insights and advice on improving your skills and confidence. h. Consider professional help: If your lack of confidence with girls is significantly impacting your everyday life or causing severe anxiety, don't hesitate to seek advice from therapists or counselors specializing in relationships and social dynamics. In conclusion, while both questions point towards self-confidence issues, they address different aspects of confidence-building. The first question deals with overcoming shyness and building general self-confidence, whereas the second question is specific to boosting confidence in romantic interactions and relationships with the opposite gender. It is essential to address both aspects to achieve a comprehensive improvement in your overall confidence and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. How do you do this: bucket","output":"A bucket is a container that you use to hold or carry things, like water, sand, or small toys. To use a bucket, follow these simple steps: 1. Find an empty bucket: Look for a bucket that has nothing in it. It can be made of plastic, metal or any other material. It should have a handle for easy carrying. 2. Choose what to put in it: Decide what you want to carry in the bucket. It could be water from a tap, sand at the beach, or toys in your playroom. 3. Fill the bucket: If you're filling it with water, put the bucket under the tap and turn the tap on until the bucket is full or you have enough water. If it's sand, take the bucket to the sand and use your hands or a small shovel to scoop the sand into the bucket. For toys, just pick them up and put them inside the bucket. 4. Carry the bucket: Hold the handle of the bucket and lift it carefully, making sure not to spill what's inside. Carry the bucket to where you want to take the things inside. 5. Empty the bucket: When you reach your destination, gently tip the bucket to pour out the water, sand, or drop the toys where you want them. If it's not easy to pour, you can use your hands or a small shovel to help empty the bucket. 6. You're done! Now your bucket is empty, and you can use it again for carrying other things or put it away until you need it next time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating Answer:","output":"The final step of the process mentioned is the formation of a tropical cyclone (also referred to as a hurricane or typhoon, depending on the region).  Here's a detailed breakdown of the process: 1. Thunderstorms form over the ocean: Warm, moist air over the ocean rises, creating areas of low pressure beneath. This rising air then cools and condenses, forming clouds and thunderstorms. 2. An area of low pressure causes rotation: The Earth's rotation causes the Coriolis effect, which imparts a spin to the rising air masses, creating a rotation around the area of low pressure. 3. Several thunderstorms come together around this area: As the rotating air continues to pull in more moisture and energy from the warm ocean water, multiple thunderstorms group together, creating a larger and more organized weather system. 4. The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating: The warm ocean water provides the necessary fuel for the storm to intensify. The heat from the water causes more water to evaporate, which rises and cools, releasing latent heat in the process. This heat release further fuels the development and intensification of the storm. Final Step: Formation of a tropical cyclone (hurricane or typhoon): As the storm continues to gather strength and organizes itself around a central core, it becomes a tropical cyclone. This is characterized by a well-defined circulation with a calm central eye, surrounded by a wall of powerful thunderstorms and strong winds. The tropical cyclone will continue to grow and intensify as long as it has access to warm ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. Once the cyclone moves over land or into cooler waters, it will lose its energy source and gradually weaken and dissipate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At a spring conference in Liverpool, Ms Lucas will say the two parties could \\"forge a new grouping in Parliament\\". The Greens are polling in similar numbers to the Lib Dems and say their membership quadrupled in the past year. But the party's leader Natalie Bennett has faced criticism of her performance in recent weeks. She struggled in a radio interview to explain how a flagship policy to build 500,000 new social rented homes would be funded, later attributing her performance to an \\"excruciating mind blank\\". The leader of the Green Party on Liverpool council, John Coyne, said he had been \\"taken aback\\" by her \\"excruciating\\" performance and she had clearly been \\"underprepared\\". He told the BBC that it wouldn't happen again as Ms Bennett - who could take part in a TV debate with other party leaders should they go ahead - would in future rehearse her performance in mock interviews. \\"It's a failure that she was underprepared we know why that happened and we know it will be fixed for the future,\\" Mr Coyne - a former Liberal Democrat who is now chair of the Green Councillors Association - said. Main pledges \\"It was a serious failure and we thought it might be damaging to us but one thing that perhaps is saving us from that is people who are attracted to the Green Party tend to have a more generous disposition anyway tend to be able to forgive a mistake.\\" In her conference speech, Ms Bennett will say her party offers a \\"message of hope and real change\\" and would create \\"a political system that puts the public first\\".

Summarize this article: Talk to the girl about where she feels comfortable going. Choose a location where the girl will likely feel comfortable, such as your home or a hotel room. Make sure you'll be alone and uninterrupted while you're hooking up. For instance, you might take her to your home or you might ask to go back to hers. If you can't take her home, you could rent a hotel room or arrange to go to a friend's home. Consent is essential when you’re hooking up. Don’t assume that she wants to have sex just because she agrees to be alone with you. Pay attention to her words and body language to see if she’s into it. When in doubt, ask her directly if she wants to have sex.  Signs she’s into it include smiling, initiating kissing and physical contact, asking you to do sexual things to her, and getting close to you. Signals she’s not into it include pulling away, looking away from you, and changing the subject. You could just ask, “Do you want to have sex?” or “Do you want to take this to the bedroom?” Hooking up can be super fun, but it’s important to avoid potential complications. Talk to the girl before you become intimate to decide what kind of protection you'll use. Ask her if she is currently on birth control pills, has received a birth control shot, or has an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. Additionally, wear a condom or dental dam to protect you against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Even if the girl is on birth control, it’s typically best to use a barrier form of protection to protect against STDs anyway. Start by kissing her on the hand, arm, or cheek. Then, give her a passionate kiss on the lips. If you’re both into it, kiss her in other intimate places, like her neck, breasts, or thighs.  Go slow at first. Give her a light kiss and gauge her reaction. Don’t use tongue when you first start kissing her. Build up to it so she doesn’t feel like you’re rushing things. She’s going to be more interested in a hookup if she feels sexually excited. Don’t rush things by trying to start intercourse too soon. Instead, take your time to caress her, kiss her body, and rub against her. This will help her get into the mood for sex. For instance, start by gently caressing her body. Then, move from kissing her lips to making a trail of kisses down her neck, chest, stomach, and thighs. Simply shift her clothing or remove it as you go. Don't just get up an leave after a hook-up. Instead, talk to the girl to make sure she enjoyed it. Then, clean yourself up and get dressed. If you're at her place, thank her for having you over before you leave. If you're at your place, offer to help her get home safely. If you've gotten a hotel room, ask her if she'd prefer to stay overnight or go home. Both your and her experience will be better if you part on good terms. Show her that you care about her health and well-being by helping her get home. Offer to drive her home or to call her a ride if she can't drive herself home. If she's got her car and feels comfortable driving herself home, walk her to her car and ask her to text when she gets home. If you stay the night together, talk to her before you fall asleep so you both understand each other's expectations for the morning after. For instance, decide if you're both okay with the person who slept over leaving without waking the other. While you might not be interested in a relationship, it's still important to be kind to the girl you hooked-up with. Tell her that you enjoyed meeting her and had a good time. Additionally, ask her if she had a nice time so she feels like you care about her.  You might text, \\"It was great meeting you last night! I had a great time and hope you did, as well.\\" You don't have to have a long conversation with her. However, sending a check-up text shows her that you don't just see her as an object. Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of creating a comfortable environment for both parties during a hook-up, and highlights the significance of consent, communication, and protection against STDs and pregnancy. It advises to pay attention to body language and verbal cues to assess the girl's interest and level of comfort. Physical intimacy should be initiated gradually, and rushing into intercourse is discouraged. Ensuring mutual enjoyment and maintaining a friendly and respectful attitude after the hook-up is essential for a good experience on both sides. Additionally, taking responsibility for the girl's safe return home and following up with a kind message are recommended to show genuine care and consideration for her well-being."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Munich Movie plot: A scene from the film representing the Mossad team from 1972. From left to right: Avner Kaufman, Robert, Carl, Hans and Steve. Munich begins with a depiction of the events of the 1972 Munich Olympics and then cuts to the home of Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir, where Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent of German-Jewish descent, is chosen to lead an assassination mission against 11 Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre. To give the Israeli government plausible deniability and at the direction of his handler Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), Avner resigns from Mossad and operates with no official ties to Israel. His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: South African driver Steve (Daniel Craig), Belgian toy-maker and explosives expert Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), former Israeli soldier and \\"cleaner\\" Carl (CiarÃ¡n Hinds), and a Danish document forger named Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are given information by a shadowy French informant, Louis (Mathieu Amalric). In Rome, the team shoots and kills Wael Zwaiter, who is broke and living as a poet. In Paris, they detonate a bomb in the home of Mahmoud Hamshari; in Cyprus, they bomb the hotel room of Hussein Abd Al Chir. With Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commandos, they pursue three Palestinians to BeirutâMuhammad Youssef al-Najjar; Kamal Adwan; and Kamal Nasser, a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) spokesmanâpenetrating the Palestinians' guarded compound and killing all three. Between hits, the often-reluctant assassins argue about the morality and logistics of their mission, expressing fear about their individual lack of experience, as well as ambivalence about accidentally killing innocent bystanders. Avner makes a brief visit to his wife, who has given birth to their first baby. In Athens, when they track down Zaiad Muchasi, the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safehouse with their rival PLO members, and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending to be foreign terrorist groups like ETA, IRA, ANC, and...

Whether it's planting vibrant flowers, carefully cultivating vegetables, or creating peaceful, green spaces, gardening is an art form that brings life, color, and texture to any landscape. A well-crafted garden can serve as an inviting escape for homeowners while simultaneously attracting admiration from friends, family, and passersby. In today's digital age, it's easier than ever to showcase and share your creative accomplishments through blogging—all the while learning from, inspiring, and engaging with a gardening community that shares your passion. In this article, we'll break down how to design and create an eye-catching garden display, capture it effectively in digital format, and launch a successful blog to share your progress and enthusiasm with the world. 1. Start Crafting Your Garden Display The journey to a breathtaking garden showcase begins with setting a clear goal for your landscape. Consider your available space and resources, then decide what type of garden display would suit your environment and personal preferences. Here are three styles to contemplate: a. The Container Garden – If you're short on space, a container garden can be an excellent solution. With this approach, you'll cultivate a variety of plants in pots and creatively arrange them on balconies, patios, or terraces to create a visually appealing display. b. Themed Garden – Themed gardens showcase plants and garden features with a specific focus, such as color schemes, symbolism, or regional influences. These can be an excellent choice if you want to make a unique statement and showcase your personal interests or ideas. c. Edible Landscape – Vegetable and herb gardens are not only practical but also artistically appealing. Combine flowers, vegetables, and herbs in inventive ways to create an eye-catching, edible display. No matter what style you choose, start with a well-planned layout that includes paths, benches, or other functional elements to create a welcoming, comfortable space. Use color combinations, height variations, and eye-catching containers or garden props to enhance visual interest. 2. Capture Your Garden's Beauty As your garden comes to life, it's crucial to document its progress and development. Photography is one of the best ways to convey the essence and flair of your blooming masterpiece. Consider the following tips for photographing your garden: a. Light it up – The quality and type of light can have a significant impact on garden photography. Early morning and late afternoon sunlight are ideal for capturing warm, soft images. b. Use different perspectives – Experiment with various angles and viewpoints to capture interesting shots. Get up close to focus on the details of individual plants or step back to showcase your entire garden layout. c. Pay attention to composition – A well-composed photograph is crucial for capturing your garden's spirit effectively. Use the rule of thirds, selective focus, and leading lines to create visual balance and interest. 3. Launch Your Garden Blog Starting a garden blog is an excellent way to share your passion, discoveries, and progress with a broader audience. Follow these steps to establish and grow a successful garden blog: a. Choose a platform – There are many blogging platforms available today, such as WordPress, Blogger, or Wix. Pick one that suits your style, technical prowess, and budget. b. Craft a compelling design – Your blog's design should reflect the aesthetics and themes of your garden. Customize color palettes, font selection, and layout to create a cohesive, visually appealing appearance. c. Develop engaging content – Write informative and entertaining posts about your gardening journey, including tips on design, plant selection, and garden maintenance. Share your photographs and consider creating video content or tutorials to engage your audience further. d. Promote and engage – Engage with gardening communities on social media, join gardening forums, and collaborate with fellow garden bloggers to increase your exposure and interact with like-minded enthusiasts. Conclusion Crafting a unique garden display offers many rewards, from personal satisfaction and rejuvenation to recognition and admiration from others. By capturing your garden's progress and sharing it through a blog, you can inspire, entertain, and educate fellow garden enthusiasts while building a diverse and supportive community. Embrace the creative process, consistently hone your skills, and watch your garden—and your blog—bloom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an article: She checked PayScale, and its free report that compares her pay with others holding a similar job title said that someone with her experience should be making 50,000 to 60,000. Then she went to see her manager. “I was a little nervous going in, but I had done my research,” Ms. Morrison, 27, said. She got the title she wanted and a raise to within the pay range she suggested. “If I had gone in without the information, the conversation would have been, ‘I feel like I am not making enough money,’ ” Ms. Morrison said. More extensive salary surveys are done for corporations, but a regular employee could not hope to buy the information from any of the other major compensation companies like the Hay Group or Mercer. “We wouldn’t give it to you,” said Iain Fitzpatrick, general manager of the reward information service division of Hay. The compensation companies do not want their information being used against bosses negotiating salaries. “The last thing we want is for a client to say, ‘We just had a conversation with an employee who was quoting Hay data,’ ” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. Unlike Salary.com, which obtains its information from a variety of surveys of corporate human resource departments, PayScale collects the information directly from people seeking the data. If you want PayScale’s salary information, first you will have to tell them what you make. A basic report is free, but the company charges 20 for a more detailed analysis. PayScale, which supplies its data to job listing sites like CareerBuilder.com, Jobster.com and SimplyHired.com, says it uses search engine technology and a rules-based algorithm to match requests for data in a database of 5.5 million profiles. Executives at Salary.com, which provides its data to job boards at America Online, Yahoo, HotJobs.com and Monster.com, take issue with the new approach. Their survey found 96 percent of human resources departments do not trust user-reported data. William Coleman, senior vice president for compensation at Salary.com, said, “People get information wrong.” He said they often did not understand what benefits or bonuses they were getting, so he considered any self-reporting to be suspect. But Joe Giordano, the founder, chairman and also vice president for product development at PayScale, said its information was accurate. “People come onto PayScale with no incentive to lie because they want high-quality information,” he said. The company checks the information for inconsistencies, tossing out extremes. It said that about 50 percent of submissions were not included, but that it got enough, about 300,000 a month, that no single filing could influence the overall result. “We collect more in one day than some companies collect in a year,” said Michael Metzger, the chief executive. It takes about six minutes to fill in its questionnaire. PayScale asks for your title, the number of years in the field and your city. It then asks you to better define your job. If you said software programmer, it wants to know what kind of programmer and what programming languages you know. People in professions with a profusion of titles are asked more questions. Finally, it asks you questions about your employer, your education, and, of course, your salary and benefits. Then it computes the results and displays them on a graph so you can see the range. A senior software engineer in Silicon Valley with 20 years of experience makes 88,531 to 106,364. A benefits claims examiner in Indianapolis, who has been on the job for a decade, makes 41,122 to 54,821. Although Salary.com argues that its paid results are more accurate, its free Salary Wizard tool yields results that can barely differ: for example, a range of 84,289 to 107,711 for the programmer and 40,091 to 52,942 for the examiner. PayScale, which gets about a third of the traffic that Salary.com does, says it has information on jobs not usually found in corporate salary surveys like pornographic film actor (average salary: 63,275), rabbi (average salary: 98,610) and crossing guard (average hourly wage: 9.21), but so far no chick sexers, mimes or bloggers are in its roster. “We don’t get many boiler makers, but we get the jobs that are out there in volume,” Mr. Giordano said. PayScale data also say that a chief executive in New York City averages 248,278. When you stop laughing, it quickly becomes apparent what the big problem with this site is. It is most accurate where it has lots of data. The company acknowledges that it is very good with high-tech jobs, health care and nonprofits because a lot of people from those professions have visited the site and filled out the questionnaire. Only 22 chief executives in New York City have bothered, and none apparently clocked more than a mere 235 an hour. “It is only as good as what people are contributing,” said James Holincheck, a research vice president at Gartner who follows the compensation industry. (Salary.com’s result was a bit more realistic: a range of 417,459 to 1,266,936.) But the sites are meant for the average person, not titans of finance and industry. “It’s like the Kelly Blue Book for compensation,” Mr. Giordano said. Like that reference manual for used-car prices, the salary sites give you a good idea of where to start the negotiations confidently. Persuading the boss you need more money demands more than a report from an online service. You have to think about the kind of company that employs you. A start-up might pay lower salaries because employees have a chance to make a killing on options when it goes public or is sold. Some companies have a policy of high turnover, so raises are rarely in the offing. Mr. Coleman suggests that people think about quality-of-life issues, as well as the money. For instance, sometimes it is easier for an employer to give an additional week of vacation rather than a 2 percent raise. A workweek condensed into four days might hold some value even though you will work no less — and probably will work more. “Money isn’t everything, but it isn’t nothing,” he said. If you want more detailed information on multiple job offers in different regions, PayScale charges 20. Salary.com charges 30 to 100 for detailed reports depending on the level of the position. Both sites offer advice and scores of ways to parse the information they have collected. Salary.com measures the salary of a stay-at-home mom. (The statisticians calculated that doing the housekeeping, cooking, babysitting, chauffeuring, administration and other jobs involved in staying at home with a preschooler in Chicago would probably take around 91 hours a week and be worth about 146,000.) Pay-Scale finds that based on the answers to a question it asks about commutes, for example, a store manager in Seattle gets to work 17 minutes faster than one in New York City. That has to be worth something.

The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

Complete the following sentence. It was important to prepare for the Chemistry exam as it was tough but the Biology was easy so Paul only prepared for the  Possible answers: [i] tough exam.. [ii] easy exam..","output":"The completion of the sentence would be: \\"It was important to prepare for the Chemistry exam as it was tough, but the Biology exam was easy so Paul only prepared for the tough exam..\\" However, to make the context clearer, let's dive deep into this:  Preparing for an examination is a crucial task, especially when it comes to different subjects that individually demand specific focus and intensive study. The scenario here describes two subjects - Chemistry and Biology, both of which have different levels of difficulty for Paul, the person in question. Chemistry, considered as a tough subject due to its complex theories and formulas, needed real attention and rigorous exercise in order to get a good handle on. It required Paul to put in considerable effort into understanding the various chemical reactions, atomic structures, and bonding mechanisms amongst other things in order to excel. Adequate preparation in such a case was important, given that lack of understanding and not being able to reason with chemical equations could lead to confusion and poor performance in the exam. On the other hand, Biology was deemed easy by Paul. This could mean that Paul found studying Biology less challenging in comparison to Chemistry. Maybe he found it easier to comprehend its concepts, memorize facts, or understand various biological processes, and so did not see the need to prioritize his time towards preparing for the Biology exam.  But to clarify, saying Paul only prepared for the Chemistry doesn't necessarily mean he ignored studying for Biology completely. It could simply mean that he prioritized his study time and efforts more towards Chemistry considering the challenges it posed, while dedicating enough time to revise Biology. In nutshell, given the varying difficulty levels of the two subjects for Paul, it would be sensible to conclude that \\"It was important to prepare for the Chemistry exam as it was tough, but the Biology was easy so Paul only prepared for the tough exam.\\" Here, preparation for the \\"tough exam\\" does not underestimate the importance of the \\"easy exam,\\" but rather defines Paul's strategic approach towards handling his exams based on their levels of difficulty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.","output":"To determine which farmer didn't spray plants thoroughly with an insecticidal soap solution, let's analyze the information provided step by step. Step 1: Understanding the problem - Pam and Mary are both gardeners dealing with aphid infestations. - Mary had more aphids and used every method and insecticide available with limited success. Step 2: Analyzing the hint provided - The hint emphasizes that insecticide control of aphids is difficult, and missing small areas can lead to a rapid population recovery. - It also mentions that for small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days might be enough. - An insecticidal soap solution can be effective but must be applied thoroughly, and it only kills aphids on contact, with no residual effect. There is also a risk of plant damage under certain conditions. Step 3: Determine which farmer didn't spray thoroughly with an insecticidal soap solution - Mary used every method and insecticide available; it would be safe to assume that this includes using an insecticidal soap solution. However, the limited success indicates that she might not have sprayed the solution entirely or that some aphids were resistant to the insecticides used. - The information provided about Pam is not sufficient to conclude whether or not she used an insecticidal soap solution. However, it is not mentioned that she had limited success like Mary. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Mary might not have sprayed plants thoroughly with an insecticidal soap solution, since her methods had limited success and she still had a significant aphid problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Fernando Alonso is revved up and ready to go ahead of his home Grand Prix at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya Sunday. The 31-year-old has not won on Spanish soil since triumphing with Renault in 2006 but is in confident mood after taking 47 points from the opening four races of the season. And the Ferrari driver says the extra incentive of winning in front of his adoring supporters has given him an extra edge going into the first European race of the year. He told a press conference: \\"I think it motivates you to race at home and you give an extra 10% on what you normally do, to take care of every detail of the weekend, starting from practice into qualifying and into the race. \\"You try to do everything well, because you know that a nice result here, a nice podium finish or whatever will make you happy, will make the team happy and make many people in the grandstand happy. \\"So, it's a special weekend, but after all those years I think you're OK with that extra motivation and it's not any more pressure. \\"Now you've proved for many years that there's not a pressure or anything that will stop you doing well.\\" If Ferrari are to succeed in seeing off Red Bull and Lotus, then the team will need to avoid any trouble on the track -- a point not lost on Alonso. \\"I think that maybe it's the first time we arrive with a competitive car, but that doesn't mean you will fight for top places if you don't do everything right and don't put together a good weekend,\\" the double world champion added. \\"In the first four races we were competitive. We thought we could fight for the top places if the race was without problems. \\"We will try here to have a clean race with no problems and if that will be enough to put us in contention for the victory, it would be nice. \\"But if it's not possible then we will try and be as high as possible. It is a weekend we approach with a positive mentality -- and not a defensive mentality like the first three years for me at Ferrari.\\" One man who Alonso will need to be wary of is triple world champion Sebastian Vettel, who currently sits 30 points clear of the Spaniard. Vettel, who won last time out in Bahrain, is expecting a difficult challenge with just ten points separating him from Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen. \\"It is much too early to make any predictions,\\" Vettel said. \\"Who would be so bold as to predict the outcome of a 19-race championship after only four races? \\"This weekend we have to concentrate on the modified tires and the work that we have to do before Sunday to get our car right.\\" Raikkonen, a two-time winner in Barcelona, finished second in Bahrain after coming home behind Vettel's Red Bull. And the Finn insists his team has much to do if they are to bridge the gap and claim a second victory of the season. \\"To catch the leaders, we have to work twice as hard as they are,\\" he told the Lotus website. \\"It's no secret that we want more speed from the car in qualifying; it's so tight up there at the front and we really need to be on the first two rows to fight for victories every time. \\"It's good to be able to start the European season where we are as this is when you see teams starting to push on with lots of new parts for the cars. \\"It's still early days, but to have scored strong points since the start of the year is obviously better than not having them. \\"We need to keep scoring points in the same way; even if it's a bad weekend for us, we need to keep finishing as well as we can. That's how we will fight to the end of the season.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Fernando Alonso is gearing up for his home Grand Prix at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya, eager to secure a victory on Spanish soil for the first time since 2006. With 47 points from the first four races of the season, the Ferrari driver is motivated to perform his best in front of his home crowd, aiming for a podium finish or better. Alonso believes that having a competitive car for the first time and a positive mentality has the potential to put him in contention for the victory. However, he remains aware of the challenge posed by triple world champion Sebastian Vettel, who is currently 30 points ahead of the Spaniard. Vettel is cautious about making any predictions and emphasizes the need to focus on car preparation before Sunday. Another contender, Kimi Raikkonen, a two-time winner in Barcelona, stresses the importance of working hard and consistently scoring points to close the gap and secure more victories this season."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were jokes which I (and most of you) thought were funny, and the Oscar audiences would have loved. But they never made air. Do you remember the clever quips from hosts Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin in 2010? Or the hilarious zingers from hosts James Franco and Anne Hathaway last year? Of course not – because there weren’t any. This year, I’m again offering more free jokes for the Oscar show. And good news – my favorite host Billy is Crystal is back for a ninth time. I wrote these especially for him, and I know that he’ll appreciate them. So Billy – please feel free to read, laugh and lift. No strings. Maybe you can give the Fox411 a shout-out if you have time, but no pressure. Our readers will know where they came from, and I guarantee you that the audience (and the world) will be grateful. 1. Good evening and welcome to the 84th Annual Academy Awards, or as I get to call it: “Mission Impossible Nine: Host Protocol.” 2. Security is especially tight, because there are people who want to keep the Oscars from being an exciting, entertaining and magical night. So James Franco is watching the show from home this year. 3. Tonight we celebrate the best drama from 2011. Ironically, much of it occurred while preparing for the Oscar telecast. Hollywood hasn’t seen people hired, fired and replaced so fast since “The Help.” 4. One of the biggest stories of the year has to be the success of “The Artist.” Such an unlikely Oscar contender. No big stars, no color, no dialogue and looks like it’s a hundred years old. It’s like watching this year’s Republican primary. 5. There are so many big stars here tonight, like George Clooney - nominated for best actor in “The Descendants.” In the film, he plays a man whose wife falls into a coma and may never wake up. It turns out that he had just made her watch “Syriana.” 6. “Moneyball” is up for six awards tonight, including best actor for Brad Pitt and best supporting actor for Jonah Hill. The only person not happy was Angelina. Turns out that she had wanted Jonah be their sitter on Oscar night. 7. There’s Meryl Streep, who celebrates her record 17th nomination for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in “The Iron Lady.” It’s funny, when she was offered the role of the toughest skirt in 1980’s Britain, she thought she was being asked to play Boy George. 8. Also in the best actress category, Glenn Close for “Albert Nobbs.” If she loses, she’ll tie the record for actress with most nominations without a win. Good news for you Glenn – I don’t know anyone who voted for you. 9. In the best supporting actor category is Christopher Plummer, nominated for “Beginners.” He plays a man who comes out of the closet at the age of 75. It’s his gayest role since Captain von Trapp in “The Sound of Music.” 10. One of the most-talked performances of year has got to be Octavia Spencer’s in “The Help.” Not only is she a great actress, but she’s incredibly gracious. If she doesn’t win, she’s promised to leave the show early to help make pastries at the Governor’s Ball. 11. The hilarious film “Bridesmaids” is up for two awards tonight. It’s about a group of self-absorbed women who plan for a wedding in which everything goes wrong. The working title was “The Kardashians.” 12. Iran has an entry in the foreign language film category. “A Separation” deals with issues like divorce, child custody, domestic violence and manslaughter. Iranian President Ahmadinejad described it as “the best comedy of the year.” 13. As usual, we do expect the show to run late. How late? Let’s put it this way: “Midnight in Paris” could actually be named best picture at midnight in Hollywood. 14. By the time the show is over, all your burning Oscar questions will finally be answered. The only thing we’ll still be asking is, “What was the meaning of ‘The Tree of Life?’”","output":"This article is about someone named Dr. Oscar who writes funny jokes for the hosts of the Academy Awards, but those jokes never get used on the show.

In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant  , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges  went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away.

Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century served to harm the music industry through inadequate representation. Why was the commercialization of classical music harmful to the music industry according the Shawn Vancour?","output":"To analyze and understand why Shawn Vancour believes that the commercialization of classical music was harmful to the music industry, let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Define the issue The issue being discussed here is the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century. Commercialization generally refers to the process of making something profitable or driven by market forces. Step 2: Identify the main argument Shawn Vancour believes that this commercialization was detrimental to the music industry, especially in the context of inadequate representation. Step 3: Delve into the possible reasons for the argument There could be multiple reasons as to why Shawn Vancour feels the commercialization of classical music was harmful, based on inadequate representation: 1. Narrow focus on profit: The music industry may have been more focused on making money rather than preserving or promoting the art form. This could lead to a limited selection of classical works being recorded and distributed, which in turn results in a lack of diversity and exposure to lesser-known composers or pieces of music. 2. Market-driven choices: The focus on creating commercial value could have led companies to prioritize popular or well-established works over lesser-known pieces. This would again result in a narrow representation of the genre's full potential and diversity. 3. Undermining artistic merit: The commercialization could weaken the perceived value or importance of classical music as an art form. When profitability becomes a primary focus, it can overshadow the importance of preserving the cultural and artistic integrity of the music. 4. Homogenization of taste: When commercial forces dominate the representation of classical music, there's a risk that the selection of works becomes more homogeneous, driven by what sells best rather than what's artistically significant or diverse. In conclusion, according to Shawn Vancour, the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century was harmful to the music industry because it led to inadequate representation of the genre. This claim is based on the idea that the commercial focus on profitability may have limited the exposure of lesser-known composers and pieces, as well as undermined the artistic merit and diversity inherent to classical music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Josh Movie plot: Indra (Jeet) and Rajib (Anshuman) are the thickest of friends studying in the same college. When Indra comes to the city to visit Rajib, Indra notices Rajib's sister, Anu (Srabanti Chatterjee), and is attracted to her instantly. When Rajib visits his home village, Indra visits along with him. Anu, who returns from Singapore, is impressed by Indra, who continually impresses her, based on her tastes. He gets along well with Rajib's and Anu's family, in the meanwhile convinces them that he would make a prospective groom for Anu. Anu's family, mainly her brother and cousin, are involved in regional gangs in their village. When Anu takes out Indra to the temple for a visit, without the knowledge of their brother (Tapas Paul), Anu is then attacked by Rudra's brother Nikhil (Bharat Kaul) gets hold of Anu and threatens to kill Anu. In a swift action of bravery and skill, Indra knocks down Rudra's brother. After this incident, Anu's brother, gives Indra a talk about why things are so violent in the village. He explains how he is a master's degree holder from a prestigious university (Pune) and how his wife is also a master's degree holder in integrated mathematics. Unfortunately, due the nature of the villages, the rivalry is deadly and fatal. He ultimately says, even though the villages are violent, he will remain a noble person, with high ideals. After a few days though, in the most ungrateful manner and a show cowardice, the rival gang fights with fierce brutality, and the rival gang leader Rudra (Puneet Issar) murders Rajib's entire family, except Anu. Indra makes the promise to Anu's brother that he will take up the responsibility of Anu and that he will eventually marry her. In the process, he also becomes a rival of Rudra as he kills his younger brother Nikhil to protect Anu. After the tragedy, Indra and Anu head back to Kolkata city to attend Indra's sister's marriage. The movie shows the jovial aspects of the marriage ceremonies. At the end of the marriage, an uncle of Indra insults Anu and tells her to leave...

News article: Remembering the Air Florida crash, 30 years later Today marks the 30th anniversary of the Air Florida crash in Washington, D.C. In that historically significant accident, Air Florida Flight 90 struggled to lift off after departing from National Airport in snowy and icy conditions. The plane hit Washington's 14th Street Bridge shortly after takeoff and then crashed and sank in the icy Potomac River. VIDEO: 1982 report on Air Florida crash The crash killed 78 people – 74 crew and passengers from the flight as well as four people who had been in their cars on the bridge. Five survived the crash, and their dramatic rescue was captured live by a TV crew that had been stuck in rush-hour traffic near the bridge. Rush-hour traffic began early that day and was unusually heavy following the federal government's decision to release workers early because of the snow. The tragedy left lasting legacies on two fronts. The breaking live-from-the-scene TV reports were – perhaps – a hint of how news would increasingly be delivered to viewers in the modern era. But, more important, many industry experts say the crash spurred the adoption of new safety protocols that have dramatically enhanced aviation safety. THE WASHINGTON POST: 30 years after Air Florida crash, skies safer than everTHE WASHINGTON POST: Air Florida survivors reflect on crash that changed their livesTHE WASHINGTON POST: A crash's improbable impactTHE WASHINGTON POST: See the Post's coverage from 1982 The Washington Post, which has a series of excellent pieces on the crash's 30th anniversary, writes: While most air disasters quickly become historical footnotes, aviation safety experts say few crashes have left a legacy as sweeping as Air Florida Flight 90. Though some of the lessons may seem simple, such as communication and management skills, it helped break down an authoritarian cockpit culture dominated by captains. Over time, the principles learned from the disaster gradually migrated to other modes of transportation and into businesses, even hospitals. In a separate article on the story, the Post adds: There are at least three reasons that in 2012 your plane shouldn't be covered with ice: better chemicals to keep the ice off, stricter regulations and better training for ground and cockpit crews. \\"All three of those have evolved significantly over the last 30 years,\\" Tom Hendricks, senior vice president for safety, security and operations at Airlines for America, says to the Post. (Read the full version of that compelling report on that in the Post). THE WASHINGTON POST: Crash of Air Florida Flight 90 The Post also runs an interesting recap on the survivors. Among the many interesting anecdotes from the story is one involving flight attendant Kelly Duncan, the only crewmember to survive the flight. She tells the Post writes that as she was floating in the Potomac, she remembers seeing people on the bank. She says at first she became angry they weren't helping – even though, in hindsight, there was little they could realistically do. Another survivor – Joseph Stiley, now 72 – tells the Post he can't definitively tell what memories are actually his – or ones that stem from seeing the crash after-the-fact on TV. \\"I remember coming out of the airplane. I remember the [rescue] helicopter. . . . I remember the ambulance. I remember seeing the lights in the hospital. I remember a lot of other things related to the Air Florida crash, but I don't know how much of that was because of the coverage,\\" he tells the Post. And, of course, there's the story of Lenny Skutnik, a bystander who ultimately jumped into the river to help the survivors. One eyewitness – WTOP radio reporter Dave McConnell – says he'll never forget. He had been covering an event in downtown D.C. when he was told to head to the bridge. \\"I was absolutely shocked to see the bodies that had been taken from the icy waters... I think that was the most disturbing scene that I had ever witnessed,\\" McConnell says in a WTOP story. He adds: \\"What happened to those people, what happened out on the banks of the Potomac, that happened here in Washington, it's something that I don't think I'll ever forget.\\" NEW BOOKMARK: Add Today in the Sky to your favorites TWITTER: You can follow me at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article marks the 30th anniversary of the Air Florida crash in Washington, D.C., which occurred when Air Florida Flight 90 struggled to lift off in snowy and icy conditions and subsequently crashed into the 14th Street Bridge and the Potomac River.

The article highlights how the Air Florida crash had lasting effects on two fronts: the development of breaking live-from-the-scene TV reports and, more importantly, the adoption of new safety protocols in the aviation industry.

John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C.  But I can use this background: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\". Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation.  What is an answer for this question: Which wavelengths would be longer, case B or case C? Answer:","output":"The wavelengths of Case B (infrared light) would be longer than Case C (visible light). Infrared light has a wavelength range between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, while visible light has a wavelength range between approximately 380 to 750 nanometers (0.38 to 0.75 micrometers). Since infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light, Case B has longer wavelengths compared to Case C."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"There was a column of mere padding about \\"The Styles Poisoning Case,\\" but nothing further. \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"\\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column was an incredible piece of investigative journalism.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"There was a column of mere padding about 'The Styles Poisoning Case,' but nothing further\\" is true, it tells us several things about the hypothesis \\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column was an incredible piece of investigative journalism.\\" Let's analyze these implications in detail. 1. Lack of depth and substance: The fact that the column is described as \\"mere padding\\" suggests that its content lacks depth and substance. In other words, the column may not offer any fresh insights, new discoveries, or critical analysis of the case. For a piece to be considered an incredible piece of investigative journalism, it would typically need to delve deeper into the subject matter, uncover new information, and provide in-depth analysis that goes beyond superficial observations. 2. Insufficient information: The phrase \\"but nothing further\\" implies that the column did not expand beyond basic or preliminary information about the case. Investigative journalism is characterized by extensive research, document examination, and interviews with various sources to gather and verify accurate information. The premise implies that the column did not meet these criteria and offered little substantial information about \\"The Styles Poisoning Case.\\" 3. Lack of impact: A hallmark of exceptional investigative journalism is its ability to bring attention to previously unknown or unexplored aspects of an issue, ultimately leading to public interest, policy changes, or further conversation. In this case, the premise suggests that the column did not advance the understanding of the \\"Styles Poisoning Case,\\" indicating that it may not have the impact typically associated with outstanding investigative journalism. 4. Potential focus on sensationalism: The inclusion of \\"mere padding\\" in the description of the column may also imply that the column contained irrelevant or sensational information designed to attract readership, rather than focus on the facts of the case and solid investigative work. Exceptional investigative journalism should be built upon accurate, fact-based reporting and should not rely on sensationalism or exaggeration to draw attention. 5. Questionable credibility: As a result of lacking depth, offering insufficient information, and potentially relying on sensationalism, the credibility of the column may be called into question. Excellent investigative journalism maintains high standards of accuracy, fairness, and professionalism that contribute to its credibility and trustworthiness. The premise suggests that the \\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column may not meet these standards. In summary, if the premise is true, it significantly undermines the hypothesis that \\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column was an incredible piece of investigative journalism. The column, as described in the premise, lacks the depth, substance, and impact typically associated with high-quality investigative reporting. As a result, it is unlikely that the column entails the hypothesis of being a remarkable piece of investigative journalism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra? ?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".","output":"The name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra is George Frideric Handel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The incident occurred during the funeral of a youth who died in the hospital Saturday night after he was allegedly beaten by members of the Indian paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force during violent protests last week. The family of 25-year-old Rafiq Bangroo said CRPF troopers struck him on the head with gun butts, causing a fatal skull injury. The CRPF has denied the allegation, saying Bangroo died after he was pelted with stones. Bangroo's body was handed over to relatives. As it was being carried for burial Sunday, angry mobs charged at a bunker of the CRPF and attempted to burn it, police said. The CRPF troopers manning the bunker opened fire on the crowd.

Question: \\"Which 16th century English composer's works include 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' and the Christmas mass Puer Natus est Nobis\\"\\"?\\" Answer:","output":"The 16th century English composer whose works include 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' and the Christmas mass 'Puer Natus est Nobis' is Thomas Tallis. Born around 1505 and passing away in 1585, Tallis is considered one of England's most important and influential composers of his time, particularly in the area of sacred choral music. His compositions were created during a period of significant religious transition in England, as the country was going through the Reformation, which shifted the nation's religious practices from Catholicism to Protestantism and back multiple times. Thomas Tallis primarily worked as a church musician and held several important positions during his career. He served as an organist and singer at the Dover Priory before transitioning to a similar position at St. Mary-at-Hill Church in London. In 1540, he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, a prestigious post that he held for over four decades. In this role, he composed and performed music for the monarchs of England, including King Henry VIII, Edward VI, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth I. 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' is an elaborate votive antiphon that was composed in the late 1540s to early 1550s. It is notable for its rich polyphony and expansive structure. The piece demonstrates Tallis' mastery of various choral techniques, such as imitative counterpoint and contrasting textures. The text of 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' is devotional and focused on the Virgin Mary, indicative of the composer's Catholic background. 'Puer Natus est Nobis' is a Christmas mass that showcases Tallis' talent in creating rich and complex choral works. Set to the text of the Latin Gradual and Alleluia for the Feast of the Nativity, this mass is an exquisite example of the composer's ability to fuse together intricate polyphony with the simplicity and solemnity of plainchant. The piece features seven voice parts, utilizing the full range of vocal textures and harmonies available during the time in which it was composed. Tallis' works are renowned for their beauty and spiritual depth and have had a lasting impact on the development of English choral music. Many of his pieces have remained in the standard repertoire of choirs throughout the centuries, testament to their enduring quality and influence. Notable compositions by Tallis include 'If ye love me,' 'Spem in alium,' 'Lamentations of Jeremiah,' and 'O nata lux.' His music bridges the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods, demonstrating the range and adaptability that makes Tallis such a pivotal figure in the history of English sacred music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kendrick, who declined to name the texter, put her phone away and sat up for the interview.

Hacker group releases information about Cincinnati Police Department employees Hacking group Anonymous briefly posted online a video detailing the personal information of 52 Cincinnati Police Department employees, including Chief Eliot Isaac, Cincinnati.com reported. The group said it released the info Sunday night in response to Wednesday’s shooting death of Paul Gaston, a black man, by three white Cincinnati cops. By 4:30 a.m. Monday the video had been taken down, according to WLWT. “Thin Blue Line, your game is over,” an Anonymous figure said in the video, according to a transcript. “You lost. While we release your officers’ information, we will hold no responsibility of the actions of those that see the information.” That information included names, ages, street addresses, email addresses and social media accounts, as well as the names and addresses of officers’ family members. It’s unclear if the information was obtained via a data breach or through publicly available sources, Cincinnati Police Lt. Steve Saunders told Cincinnati.com. The incident that prompted the Anonymous action involved the somewhat contentious details surrounding Gaston’s death. While video of the incident shows Gaston initially on his knees with his hands behind his head as cops approach him, police said he reached toward his waistband for what they believed to be a weapon before they shot him. Video evidence appears to back up the officers’ assertions. After his death, authorities discovered Gaston was carrying a pellet gun designed to look like a real weapon. Anonymous included footage of the shooting – which police had previously released – as part of its video message. “For far too long we have sat idle by letting the gang known as the Thin Blue Line murder citizens of United States without allowing them due process,” the video transcript said. “Well, we have a message to not only the Cincinnati Police Department but to every law enforcement officer. When you murder a human being when you have other choices of containing your suspect available, we will make your officers’ information public record.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Hacker group Anonymous released a video detailing personal information of 52 Cincinnati Police Department employees in response to the shooting death of Paul Gaston, a black man, by three white Cincinnati cops.

When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, King Otto of Greece saw an opportunity to expand North and South into Ottoman areas that had large Greek Christian majorities. However, Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. Greece, an Orthodox nation, had considerable support in Russia, but the Russian government decided it was too dangerous to help Greece expand its holdings.:32–40 When the Russians invaded the Principalities, the Ottoman forces were tied down so Greece invaded Thessaly and Epirus. To block further Greek moves, the British and French occupied the main Greek port at Piraeus from April 1854 to February 1857, and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Greeks, gambling on a Russian victory, incited the large-scale Epirus Revolt of 1854 as well as uprisings in Crete. The insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the Ottoman army. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war.:139 The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who stirred up the Epirus Revolt of 1854?","output":"Some Greek people, hoping for a Russian win in the war, started the Epirus Revolt of 1854.

The King of Greece didn't do a good job in this situation, and many people were not happy with him after that."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has a younger sister, Hillary, and a younger brother, Andrew. In 2002, Fall Out Boy released an EP called Fall Out Boy/Project Rocket Split EP. Soon after, in 2003, the band released their mini-LP Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend on Uprising Records. This album would later be digitally remastered and reissued after the band's third, successful full-album release From Under the Cork Tree, on the major label Island Records. In 2003, the band released their first full-length album, Take This to Your Grave through Fueled By Ramen. Fall Out Boy signed with major label Island Records in 2003 and in 2004 released an acoustic EP and DVD entitled, My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue.  Their third album, From Under the Cork Tree, was released in 2005. Wentz wrote the lyrics to the lead single, \\"Sugar, We're Goin Down\\" with his dad in Chicago; the song peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent months in the top 50 of the Hot 100, marking five weeks in the top 10 and fourteen weeks in the top 20. The band's major label debut album has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA as well as \\"Sugar, We're Goin Down.\\"  In 2007, Fall Out Boy's fourth album, Infinity on High was released to major success, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 sales, spurred by the #2 charting lead single, \\"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\\". The second single, \\"Thnks fr th Mmrs\\" sold more than 2 million units in the US. The band's fifth studio album, Folie a Deux was released on December 13, 2008, and debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200. The band toured extensively in support of their albums.  On November 20, 2009, the four band members announced they will be taking an indefinite hiatus, saying they were unsure of the future of the band. Wentz has said that his personal reason for taking a break is that he feels that his name and marriage to pop singer Ashlee Simpson had become a hindrance for the band. He added: \\"I think the world needs a little less Pete Wentz\\".  On February 4, 2013, the band announced their hiatus was over, via their official webpage.

However, the French government forces Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau as the Inspector of the Sûreté (as they had been planning to anyway, much to Dreyfus' chagrin) so that he can go to the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Lugash to investigate the theft of the fabled Pink Panther diamond, which has once again been stolen.Clouseau's investigation at the Lugash National Museum, which he nearly destroys with his klutzy ways, lead him to believe that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the notorious Phantom, is re-creating the most infamous heist of his career.

His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

The university student, 21, pleaded guilty to accessing details of Frances Abbott's scholarship. Newman was sentenced to a two-year good behaviour bond in November. Article:","output":"Title: Freya Newman Rebuilds Her Life with a Greens Internship: Lee Rhiannon Provides Second Chances Senator Lee Rhiannon of the Australian Greens party recently confirmed that Freya Newman, a university student, has secured a coveted position as an intern in The Greens’ office. The announcement comes after a competitive application campaign that saw more than 160 applicants vying for the part-time, paid position. Newman's tenacity and resilience stood out amidst intense competition, leading to her successful selection. The fact that her starting date is set for April is seen as a testament to both her commitment and the party's faith in her skills and potential. The internship, which was publicly advertised in November, garnered significant attention from a diverse group of candidates. Its attractiveness largely stems from the opportunity to work directly with veteran politician Lee Rhiannon, whose decades-long commitment to public service, social justice, and environmental issues have earned her a place among the country's most respected lawmakers. Newman, who is just 21 years old, spoke about how she knew the opportunity to learn from someone of Rhiannon's caliber would provide invaluable experience. The appointment carries symbolic implications beyond Newman's personal achievement. Only a few months ago, the young university student found herself in legal trouble that could have dismantled her career prospects before they had even begun. Newman pled guilty to accessing private scholarship information of Frances Abbott, daughter of former prime minister Tony Abbott. While the incident arose from a whistleblower attempt to reveal perceived favoritism in the awarding of scholarships, the fallout was significant. Apologizing for her actions and demonstrating responsibility for the consequences, Newman was eventually sentenced to a two-year good behaviour bond in November. However, her actions threw her into the public eye for all the wrong reasons, creating a powerful stain on what was once a promising academic and career trajectory. Newman's opportunity to intern with Senator Rhiannon and the Greens represents more than just a second chance. It's a powerful statement about the capacity of individuals to learn from their mistakes and rebuild their lives, even after public scandals. It's also a bold testament to the Greens' commitment to offering opportunities to individuals regardless of their past, viewing them as more than the sum of their history. Senator Rhiannon’s decision underscores the party's ethos of social justice, which asserts that everyone deserves to experience the benefits of learning and growth, no matter the mistakes they've made in the past. It also demonstrates her belief in Newman’s potential to contribute positively to society and the work of the Greens. By deciding to offer Newman the internship out of a pool of more than 160 applicants, Senator Rhiannon is providing a strong vote of confidence in Newman’s future. It speaks volumes about Rhiannon's faith in Newman's potential to not only learn from her past but also to meaningfully contribute to the Greens' work. In an era where public figures are constantly under scrutiny and a single negative event can taint a reputation, Newman's appointment offers a different narrative. It extends an opportunity for redemption and rebirth, fortifying the idea that falling does not discount one from rising again. And, this part-time gig at the Australian Greens' office may just be the 'Phoenix rising from the ashes' moment in Newman's life.   The internship will not erase Newman's past but it will certainly provide her with a platform to demonstrate that she’s more than her mistakes. It’s a crucial step towards re-establishing herself in the public sphere. With Senator Lee Rhiannon's strength to swim against the current, a promising narrative of reformation begins to take shape. The tale of Freya Newman is undoubtedly forming an inspiring chapter in the book of 'second chances'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the event where Ash Carter was sworn in as Defense Secretary, Vice President Biden was seen placing his hands on Stephanie Carter's shoulders and leaning close to whisper something in her ear. This seemingly innocent action ignited a firestorm of speculation and outrage regarding Biden's ability to control his mouth and hands, particularly with someone as high-profile as the wife of the Defense Secretary. This incident comes as new taunts about Biden's long-standing desire to become president emerged. Critics have pointed out that he has been running for the position since even before some of them could vote, further questioning whether or not Biden possesses the necessary restraint, diplomacy, and professionalism needed for the highest office in the land. In a somewhat related development, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus made light of the situation by poking fun at Hillary Clinton during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Priebus jokingly noted that Clinton wouldn't enjoy speaking at CPAC as there was an 'insufficient croute de te' and 'the lemon wedges were cut quite at the right angle.' It remains to be seen how, or if, these latest incidents will impact Biden's political career and what further challenges he will face in the ongoing quest for the presidency.

A:","output":"Large waterways can be divided into various types that include both rivers and streams. While rivers are generally larger compared to streams, it is essential to note that they both contribute to the overall structure and function of waterways. In the context of the provided answer choices, the most appropriate categorization for dividing large waterways would be:  - Lakes: These are typically large bodies of water that are surrounded by land. They can be either natural or man-made and can accumulate water from various sources, including rivers and streams. - Body water: This term broadly encompasses all types of water bodies, including large waterways such as rivers, streams, lakes, and even oceans. As a category, body water serves as a reasonable way to divide large waterways, as it accounts for the wide variety of water bodies that can be found on Earth. - Oceans: These are vast bodies of saltwater that cover around 70% of the Earth's surface. While not generally regarded as a subdivision of large waterways, they do serve as an essential component within the broader scope of natural water systems. - Creeks: These are typically smaller watercourses that are in some cases, considered minor tributaries of larger rivers. Creek classification can vary, depending on regional conventions, but they can generally be understood as subdivisions of larger waterways. - Streams: These are smaller watercourses that can be tributaries of larger rivers. They often form intricate networks of water flow, connecting various parts of a water system. As an answer choice, streams would be the most appropriate way to categorize large waterways, given their function within broader water systems. Therefore, the best answer for dividing large waterways from the given options would be \\"streams.\\" Although lakes, body water, oceans, and creeks can also be considered components of water systems, rivers being the primary focus of large waterways can be best divided into rivers and their tributaries, which are streams. This choice reflects the hierarchical structure of waterways and highlights the interconnected nature of these systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eine neue Epoche in der Ära Manson! . Also Leute, mir ist schon klar, dass einige von euch anfangs vielleicht etwas enttäuscht über das neue Album seid, wenn ihr den \\"gewöhnlichen\\" Manson-Stil, wie er z.B. auf Holywood zu finden ist, erwartet. Dennoch sollte man sich die Platte öfters anhören, denn beim 2., 3. Mal (so wars bei mir jedenfalls), wird man förmlich von der enormen Kreativität dieses Ausnahmekünstlers mitgerissen. Die Songs haben Tiefgang, die Texte sind wirklich sehr emotional und ehrlich und beschränken sich diesmal nicht wie früher auf \\"gesellschaftskritische\\" Äußerungen und religionsfeindliche Beschimpfungen, um es etwas softer auszudrücken. Das war ja auch der Stil, der ihn berühmt gemacht hat und genau das respektiere ich ja an Brian Warner,dass er macht, was er will und sein Ding beinhart durchzieht. Jedoch zeigt sich die Qualität eines Künstlers nicht nur durch ständiges Wiederholen des Stils, sondern dass sich der Artist ständig neuentdeckt, was Marilyn Manson hier wirklich grandios geglückt ist. Zur Platte selbst möchte ich sagen, dass ich der Aussage mancher hier zustimme, dass dieses Album poppiger und kommerzieller als seine Werke zuvor gestaltet ist, aber dennoch besitzen die Songs die alt gewöhnliche und Manson typische Eigenschaft, erst nach mehrmaligem Anhören so richtig zu gefallen, obwohl zwei bis drei Songs (wie z.B. \\"Heart-Shaped Glasses\\", \\"They Said That Hell's Not Hot\\" oder \\"Just A Car Crash Away\\") durchaus beim ersten Anhören schon auf Begeisterung stoßen werden. Ganz groß möchte ich noch die klasse Leistung von Tim Skold, dem Gitarristen und Studio-Bassisten von Manson, herrausheben, der die Abwesenheit von John 5 meiner Meinung nach mit Bravur ersetzt hat. Er ist nicht nur Ersatz für John, nein, er gibt der Musik durch wirklich hörenswerte und virtuose Soli ein ganz neues Gesicht. Doch auch der bekannte düstere Hintergrund ist immer noch vorhanden und ergänzt sich perfekt mit den teils poppigen Melodien. Die einzigartige Stimme Mansons, kombiniert mit dem völlige neuen Gitarrensound, setzt der neuen Stilrichtung noch die Krone auf. Ich kann nur raten: nicht beim ersten Mal Schlüsse zu ziehen, sondern geduldig öfters anhören und sich vor allem nicht vor all den Vorurteilen abschrecken zu lassen, die es über diese LP gegeben hat. Einfach zu Hause bequem machen, den CD-Spieler einschalten und sich vom neuen Gesicht dieses Genies beeindrucken lassen und schon bald werden die hitverdächtigen Songs ins Ohr des Zuhörers vordringen, in dem sie auch ( nach eigener Erfahrung) länger verbleiben werden!","output":"POS"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  Now, I have a new situation: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.  Answer this question please: Which person doesn't have hyperopia? A:","output":"A: Jacob doesn't have hyperopia. He is nearsighted, which is the opposite of Kathy's farsightedness (hyperopia).

Only two other actual non-League clubs have even reached the final since the founding of the League: Sheffield Wednesday in 1890 (champions of the Football Alliance, a rival league which was already effectively the Second Division, which it formally became in 1892 – Wednesday being let straight into the First Division), and Southampton in 1900 and 1902 (in which years they were also Southern League champions, proving the strength of that league: again, they were probably of equivalent standard to a First Division club at the time, but Southampton's form subsequently faded and they did not join the League till 1920 and the formation of the Third Division.)

After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. Context: Appointed minister of the treasury in the first Di Rudini cabinet of 1891, he imprudently abolished the system of frequent clearings of banknotes between the state banks, a measure which facilitated the duplication of part of the paper currency and hastened the bank crisis of 1893 and the resulting Banca Romana scandal. A Parliamentary Commission that investigated the bank scandal concluded that former Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, and Luzzatti, had been aware of the conditions of the Banca Romana but had held back that information.  In 1896 he entered the second Di Rudini cabinet as minister of the treasury, and by timely legislation helped to save the bank of Naples from failure. Following the revolt and suppression of the Fasci Siciliani (1891-1894), Luzzatti introduced two measures of social legislation in 1898. The industrial workmen's compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created.  After his fall from office in June 1898, his principal achievement was the negotiation of the Franco-Italian commercial treaty, though, as deputy, journalist and professor, he continued to take an active part in all political and economic manifestations. He was again minister of the treasury from November 1903 to March 1905 in Giolitti's second administration, and for the third time from February to May 1906, under Sonnino's premiership. During the latter term of office he achieved the conversion of the Italian 5% debt (reduced to 4% by the tax) to 3 3/4 % to be eventually lowered to 3 1/2 %, an operation which other ministers had attempted without success; although the actual conversion was not completed until after the fall of the cabinet of which he formed part the merit is entirely his. In 1907 he was president of the co-operative congress at Cremona. Question: who investigated the issue?. Whats the answer?","output":"The issue of the Banca Romana scandal was investigated by a Parliamentary Commission in Italy. The commission concluded that former Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, and Luigi Luzzatti had been aware of the conditions of the Banca Romana but had withheld that information.

In 1199, Prince Roman Mstislavich united the two previously separate principalities. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of Grand Duke of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, Prince Daniil (r. 1238–1264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \\"Rex Rusiae\\" (\\"King of Russia\\") from the Roman papacy, apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople granted the King of Poland a metropolitan for his Russian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. Cyprian, a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time.

Question: Who was Zipoetes' son? Context: The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia. After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided review, I would say that the review depicts the product in a predominantly flattering light. Step by Step rationale: 1) The user starts the review by agreeing with other reviewers, indicating that there is a general consensus that the product is good. This is a positive reflection on the product. 2) He noted that there were some discrepancies with the tempo of some preludes, which could be perceived as a slight negative. However, he quickly mitigates this by suggesting that it may be due to the authenticity of the sheet music that the player was using, adding a bit of curiosity and intrigue rather than straight criticism. 3) A key flattering point in the review is the mention of Holzman as a \\"great player and a very good Ponce interpreter\\". This compliments the artist's abilities and skills, which directly attributes positive traits to the product. 4) The user recognizes that some of these pieces are hard to find and many are probably premiere recordings, another positive attribute that adds exclusivity and rarity to the product. 5) Casting more positive light on the product, the user specifically mentions 'Courante' which seems to be unique to this recording. Overall, despite a small potential critique, there's an abundance of praise and admiration in the review, leading to the conclusion that the product is presented in a flattering light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The author never treasured every relation with others; Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager  beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest  . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever.

This means that one of them desired to have children, while the other did not. Step 3: Determine which option fits the story better. Option 1 states that Betty was excited about having children, which aligns with the fact that she hoped to get pregnant. This option is consistent with the information provided in the story. Option 2, on the other hand, states that Angela was excited about having children, which contradicts the fact that she did not want to get pregnant. Therefore, Option 1 is the more suitable choice to continue the story. Step 4: Verify the selected option. Since Option 1 is consistent with the story, I will select it as the correct choice to further the narrative. Step 5: Continue the story based on the selected option. Betty hoped to get pregnant, while Angela did not, because Betty was excited about having children. She felt a strong connection to the idea of motherhood and the experiences that came along with raising a family. On the other hand, Angela had different priorities in life and preferred to focus on her career and personal aspirations. Despite their differences in opinion regarding children, the two friends remained close and supported each other in their life choices. As time went on, Betty and Angela continued to navigate their respective paths, growing together and learning from each other's experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both singles were intended to be released on Monroe's debut album, \\"Satisfied\\", in 2007, but the album went unreleased. Soon after, Monroe left Columbia Records' roster in late 2007, and \\"Satisfied\\" was finally released on May 19, 2009. In June 2011, Monroe, Miranda Lambert and Angaleena Presley formed a band called Pistol Annies. Monroe's second studio album, \\"Like a Rose\\", was released on March 5, 2013 followed by her third album \\"The Blade\\", released on July 24, 2015.  - \`\` Famous in a Small Town '' is a song written by Travis Howard and co-written and recorded by American country music artist Miranda Lambert . It was released in April 2007 as the second single from her album Crazy Ex-Girlfriend . It was Lambert 's second Top 20 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart . It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 2008 . The song was ranked number 40 on Engine 145 's 50 Best Country Songs of 2007 .  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - The Country Music Association (CMA) was founded in 1958 in Nashville, Tennessee. It originally consisted of only 233 members and was the first trade organization formed to promote a music genre. The objectives of the organization are to guide and enhance the development of Country Music throughout the world; to demonstrate it as a viable medium to advertisers, consumers and media; and to provide a unity of purpose for the Country Music industry. However the CMA may be best known to most country music fans for its annual Country Music Association Awards broadcast live on network television each fall (usually October or November).  - The Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance was first awarded in 1965, to Dottie West. The award has had several minor name changes:  - The Country Music Association Awards, also known as the CMA Awards or CMAs, are presented to country music artists and broadcasters to recognize outstanding achievement in the country music industry. The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists.  - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures).  - The Academy of Country Music Awards, also known as the ACM Awards, were first held in 1966, honoring the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the first country music awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature \\"hat\\" trophy was created in 1968. The awards were first televised in 1972 on ABC. In 1979, the Academy joined with Dick Clark Productions to produce the show. Dick Clark and Al Schwartz served as producers while Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to NBC and finally to CBS, where it remains today.  - Dottie West (born Dorothy Marie Marsh; October 11, 1932  September 4, 1991) was an American country music singer and songwriter. Along with her friends and fellow recording artists Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, she is considered one of the genre's most influential and groundbreaking female artists. Dottie West's career started in the 1960s, with her Top 10 hit, \\"Here Comes My Baby Back Again\\", which won her the first Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1965.   - The Academy of Country Music (ACM) was founded in 1964 in Los Angeles, California as the Country & Western Music Academy. Among those involved in the founding was Eddie Miller and Tommy Wiggins, who joined Mickey Christensen and Chris Christensen. They wanted to promote country music in the western 13 states with the support of artist based on the West Coast. Artist such as Johnny Bond, Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard, Roger Miller, and many more influenced them. The ball finally started rolling in 1965 when a board of directors was formed to govern the Academy.  - Miranda Leigh Lambert (born November 10, 1983) is an American country music singer and songwriter. She is best known as a solo artist, and is a member of the Pistol Annies (alongside Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley).

House Bill 1125 is currently before the New Hampshire Senate. If passed, it would repeal the crime of adultery. A recent Monitor editorial (“Repeal outdated state adultery law,” Feb. 18) encouraged passage of this bill. I disagree.      Adultery should remain a crime. The arguments against it should be unpersuasive. Taxpayers have the right to expect that those who have voluntarily stepped up and sworn to uphold the law will do so. The failure to enforce the law is to law enforcement’s discredit, not an argument to repeal the law.      Examine the law on its merits, not its enforcement. Don’t let the tail wag the dog. The government is already in consenting adults’ bedrooms, and rightly so. Our society doesn’t allow siblings to marry, or have sexual relations, consent or age of majority not withstanding. This type of behavior is repugnant to society’s idea of what a family is and is rightly considered criminal. Adultery is similarly repugnant and also ought to be criminal. Government intrusion in intimate relations should be very limited, but retaining the criminal penalties for adultery is on the proper side of the equation.      Marriage has non-controversial tax, inheritance, and criminal benefits (a spouse can’t be forced to testify in criminal proceedings) bestowed upon it by the government. It is right that conduct injurious to marriage be prohibited. Fellow citizens, please contact your state senators before April 17 and ask them to defeat this bill.      DANIEL J. HAMMOND      Nottingham ||||| N.H. may toss law against adultery      Lawmakers in the House have passed the repeal, which awaits a vote by the Senate on Thursday      By Lynne Tuohy      The Associated Press      CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire is taking steps to repeal a centuries-old law that makes it a crime to commit adultery.      The Judicial Branch reports that the law hasn’t been enforced in more than a decade.      Rep. Tim O’Flaherty, a Manchester Democrat who sponsored a House bill repealing the statute, said he was motivated by a 2003 ruling by the New Hampshire Supreme Court that same-sex partners in an adulterous affair could not be charged with adultery because of long-standing case law defining adultery as between a man and woman.      Marc Hassan, spokesman for Gov. Maggie Hassan, said she will likely sign the repeal measure if it passes.      Adultery is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to 1,200.      O’Flaherty also objects to it on privacy grounds.      “I don’t think there’s any appetite in New Hampshire to use police powers to enforce a marriage,” O’Flaherty told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during a public hearing March 25.      At the hearing, the only member of the public who spoke was a man distraught over his own divorce. He said when he tried to file a criminal adultery complaint against his former wife, the officer told him it was the first such complaint he’d taken in 20 years. The Associated Press is not naming the man because it could identify his ex-wife, who was not charged with a crime.      “If we retain adultery as a crime, we may deter an otherwise law-abiding citizen ... from falling into the trap of that repugnant behavior,” he said. “It does provide some solace to victims of adultery, who can take comfort in that fact that what happened to them was so evil the state has decided to criminalize it. That is not trivial.”      The bill passed the House 268-29 and awaits a vote by the Senate on Thursday.      The New Hampshire Supreme Court in 2003 ruled in a split decision that adultery involving two people of the same sex could not be grounds for divorce because case law dating back to the early 1800s defines adultery as “intercourse from which spurious issue may arise” – meaning a child born of the illicit affair.      “As ‘spurious issue’ can only arise from intercourse between a man and woman, criminal adultery could only be committed with a person of the opposite sex,” the court ruled. “Persons of the same gender cannot, by definition, engage in the one act that constitutes adultery under the statute.”      New Hampshire is not the only state in New England where adultery remains a crime.      In Massachusetts, adultery is punishable by up to three years in prison. In Rhode Island, anyone engaged in an adulterous affair faces a fine of up to 500, according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures.      Of 21 states that consider adultery a crime, many contain language that is gender specific and excludes same-sex married couples. For example, Oklahoma law defines adultery as “sexual intercourse of a married person with one of the opposite sex.”      “It’s not any kind of deterrence,” O’Flaherty said of the law. “People are going to cheat on their spouses regardless of what the law is.”      Rep. Carol McGuire, an Epsom Republican, co-sponsored the current repeal measure and a similar bill in 2010. The bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. McGuire said she believes opponents thought a vote for the bill was tantamount to endorsing adultery.      “I don’t want to live in a place where the police are responsible for investigating adultery,” McGuire said.      If passed and signed into law, the bill would take effect Jan. 1. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about a bill in New Hampshire that, if passed, would stop making adultery (when a married person has romantic relations with someone who isn't their spouse) a crime.

Others disagree and thought that adultery damages families and should remain a crime. The final decision will be made by the senators in a vote."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Who hasn't enjoyed eating peanuts? Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein  . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

Coal is mined out of the ground: Reduced water pollution does not affect the mining process. 2. Coal is pulverized into fine powder: Reduced water pollution does not affect the pulverizing process. 3. The coal is mixed with hot air: Reduced water pollution does not affect mixing coal with hot air. 4. The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler: Reduced water pollution does not affect this step. 5. The coal and hot air burn over a fire: Reduced water pollution does not affect combustion. 6. Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler: Assuming water purification is efficient, the reduced pollution should not have a significant effect on this step. If the water purification process is less energy-intensive due to reduced pollution, there might be some indirect positive effect on energy consumption, but this will be minimal. 7. The water turns into steam: As long as the purified water is heated to a sufficient temperature, the reduced pollution will not impact steam production. However, using cleaner water might have some indirect benefits like reduced scaling and fouling inside the boiler, leading to improved heat transfer efficiency and better performance over time. 8. The steam presses against turbines: Reduced water pollution has no direct effect on this step. 9. The turbines spin: Since the water pollution reduction has no direct impact on steam production, there is no direct effect on the spinning turbines. 10. Electricity is produced: Reduced water pollution does not affect the electricity production process.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Reuters Image caption Authorities were earlier forced to relocate the container full of corpses following complaints      A refrigerated trailer containing at least 100 corpses in Mexico's western state of Jalisco has angered residents who have complained about the smell.      Authorities said on Monday they were trying to relocate the container, which was rented after mortuaries in the city of Guadalajara became full.      \\"We have a lot of children in this neighbourhood... it could make us all sick,\\" resident José Luis Tovar said.      Laws in Mexico prevent the cremation of bodies linked to violent crime.      Local authorities said they were looking for a longer-term solution to store the bodies following a recent wave of violence.      \\"We ran out of cemetery plots where we could bury them,\\" the head of the Jalisco forensic investigators unit, Luis Octavio Cotero, said.      He added that a site was being established that was expected to facilitate some 800 corpses, AFP news agency reports.      The refrigerated trailer had previously been parked at a warehouse in the neighbourhood of Duraznera, on the outskirts of Guadalajara, but after two weeks the residents began to complain of a foul stench and said the container was attracting flies.      It was then moved to an empty lot in the suburb of Tlajomulco de Zúñiga, but residents there began to protest at the weekend.      \\"We don't want it here. They need to put it somewhere else, it stinks,\\" Mr Tovar said.      Mexico has suffered a wave of violent killings in recent years.      More than 200,000 people have been killed or have disappeared since December 2006, when Mexico's government declared war on organised crime.      Mexico experienced its most violent year in 2017 with more than 25,000 murders, official figures suggest. It is the highest annual tally since modern records began. Organised crime accounted for nearly three-quarters of those murders. ||||| Locals in Guadalajara complained after they noticed the trailer’s stench following wave of violence that overwhelmed morgues      Mexicans have reacted with outrage after authorities in the western state of Jalisco left a trailer full of decomposing corpses on the outskirts of Mexico’s second-largest city following a wave of violence which overwhelmed local morgues.      Locals in the Guadalajara suburb of Tlajomulco complained to police after they were alerted to the presence of the trailer by the stench.      “This affects our kids, it smells horrible and the longer it stays it’s going to stink even worse,�? Patricia Jiménez told Reuters.      It soon emerged that the trailer had previously been parked by officials in the suburb of Tlaquepaque, but was moved on orders of the mayor.      It has now been moved to an industrial area near the state attorney general’s office, according to news reports.      Quick guide Mexico's war on drugs Show Hide Why did Mexico launch its war on drugs? On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres. Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country. What has the war cost so far? The US has donated at least 1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least 54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level. But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces. As the cartels have fractured and diversified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence. What has been achieved? Improved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated. The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo�? Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel. While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence. How is the US involved? Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations. Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP      The Jalisco state attorney general’s office has not commented, but an official in the office said the trailer was properly refrigerated and never “abandoned�?.      The office also disputed press reports the trailer contained 157 corpses, with sources telling local media the number was closer to 100.      Jalisco’s general secretary Roberto López told local media that the state’s morgue had been overwhelmed by a surge in deaths, adding that a new morgue should be finished in a month and a half. “When it is built, these bodies will be transferred,�? he said.      The row over the trailer – which erupted as the country celebrated its national day on Sunday – was yet another reminder of the grim toll from the country’s decade-long drug war.      Mexico’s homicide rate hit a record high in 2017 with 29,168 murders registered. The country recorded 2,599 homicides in July 2018, its most murderous month since 1997, when Mexico started keeping such statistics.      It was not the first time that the bloodletting has been so severe that local morgues have run out of space – similar incidents have occurred in the opium heartlands of Guerrero.      Mexico: bounty raised over 1m on drug cartel kingpin 'El Mencho' Read more      But the gruesome episode in Guadalajara has underlined how violence has spread to all corners of the country. The surrounding Jalisco state has deteriorated rapidly in recent months: 15 people were injured in May when a gun battle erupted in the city centre after a brazen assassination attempt on the state’s employment secretary.      In March, three film students in the Guadalajara suburb of Tonalá disappeared after unwittingly filming property associated with a drug trafficker when they were working on a college project.      Much of the violence in the region is the work of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) which has disputed territories across the country – especially those controlled by the rival Sinaloa Cartel, whose former leader Joaquín “El Chapo�? Guzmán was extradited to the United States last year.      More recently, CJNG has itself splintered into rival factions. In July, US and Mexican officials announced that had raised the reward to 1.56m for information leading to the arrest of the CJNG boss Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as “El Mencho�?. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In Mexico, there was a big trailer that had many dead bodies inside it and the trailer was very cold like a refrigerator to keep the bodies from smelling bad. But the people living near the trailer started to smell something bad and they were worried that the bad smell could make them and their children sick. This happened because there have been many violent things happening in Mexico and there are too many dead bodies for the special places where they usually keep them. The people want the trailer to be moved somewhere else so they don't have to smell the bad smell."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Nathan Charles Buckley (born 26 July 1972) is a former professional Australian rules football player, commentator and coach, best known for his time as captain of the Collingwood Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is currently the senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club. He is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the top 50 players of all time. Buckley won the inaugural Rising Star Award, in 1993, then went on to become one of the game's elite, captaining Collingwood between 1999 and 2007, winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player afield in the 2002 Grand Final despite playing in the losing team, only the third player in history to do so, the Brownlow Medal in 2003, winning Collingwood's Best and Fairest award, the Copeland Trophy, six times and named in the Collingwood Team of the Century. During his first season Buckley's arrangement with the Bears became common knowledge. At the end of the contract he attracted strong interest from all Melbourne-based clubs, chiefly Collingwood, Geelong and North Melbourne. However, it was Collingwood that successfully arranged a trade deal acceptable to all parties. Unbeknown to other AFL clubs and to the AFL itself, Collingwood and Brisbane had already agreed to make the trade happen. Collingwood selected ten players on its list who were \\"untouchable\\", and the Bears could take any two players outside this list, as well as the Collingwood Magpies' first round draft pick, in exchange for Buckley. The move saw Buckley move to Collingwood in exchange for Craig Starcevich, Troy Lehmann and the Magpies' first-round draft pick (no. 12, future double-premiership player Chris Scott).  Buckley was adamant that the move was the right career direction, with the belief he had more chance of winning a premiership with Collingwood. Ironically, Brisbane would beat Collingwood in two consecutive AFL Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003. In his first season with Collingwood, the Magpies were eliminated by the West Coast Eagles by two points in Perth.  From here, Buckley would be a consistent performer for Collingwood. As well as winning a Brownlow Medal in 2003, he finished in the top three twice before the turn of the century. He was also named Collingwood's Best and Fairest six times in 10 years (including one tied), as well as six consecutive years in the All-Australian Team from 1996 to 2002.  In 1999, Buckley suffered a broken jaw playing against Carlton in Round 2. He returned in Round 8 to help Collingwood to their first win of the season and their first in 13 matches. Collingwood finished the season last, only the second time in their history (the other being in 1976). Buckley also competed in the last game at Collingwood's long-time home ground Victoria Park against one of their main rivals, the Brisbane Lions.

Background: Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards), and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are fictional and are not personas of any \\"real life\\" musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's music videos, as well as a number of other short cartoons. Context: Musician Damon Albarn and comic book artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, a band Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \\"arsey, a wanker\\"; despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.  The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, \\"If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell - there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that.\\" The band originally identified themselves as \\"Gorilla\\" and the first song they recorded was \\"Ghost Train\\" which was later released as a B-side on their single \\"Rock the House\\" and the B-side compilation G Sides. The musicians behind Gorillaz' first incarnation included Albarn, Del the Funky Homosapien, Dan the Automator and Kid Koala, who had previously worked together on the track \\"Time Keeps on Slipping\\" for Deltron 3030's eponymous debut album.  Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that \\"one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes\\" was Blur's 1997 single \\"On Your Own\\", which was released for their fifth studio album Blur. Question: What did Hewlett to help the band take off?. Whats the answer?","output":"Jamie Hewlett, a comic book artist, helped the band Gorillaz take off by creating the animated characters and the fictional universe in which the band exists. He collaborated with Damon Albarn to develop the concept of a virtual band, using his artistic talents to form the unique animated members: 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. These characters, along with their fictional world, are explored through the band's music videos and various other short cartoons, giving Gorillaz a distinct identity and visual appeal that contributed to their success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we should get rid of the constant term (-30) on the left side of the equation. To do that, we can add 30 to both sides of the equation: -30*f - 30 + 30 = 0 + 30 -30*f = 30 Step 3: Solve for f. Now, we should divide both sides of the equation by -30 to solve for f: f = 30 / -30 Step 4: Simplify the solution. f = -1 So, the solution for the equation -27*f - 3*f - 30 = 0 is f = -1."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rooney gave Manchester United a scare on Monday when he limped away from Carrington after training. However, it is understood that the United captain trained fully on Wednesday and will play at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been suspended since his red against West Ham last month. Rooney will return for the Manchester derby after serving a three-game suspension. Rooney has not played since last month after serving a three-game ban for a sending-off against West Ham. United manager Louis van Gaal has told Rooney he will definitely start and it remains to be seen who makes way. Robin van Persie could be the one to suffer after a series of indifferent performances, despite scoring a late equaliser against Chelsea at Old Trafford last Sunday. Meanwhile, former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel now believes Manchester City are a ‘bigger club’ than their local rivals based on recent form. During his eight years at Old Trafford, Schmeichel did not lose one Manchester derby and United were undoubtedly superior to City. Rooney was seen limping after attending a sponsorship event for Bulova watches at Old Trafford. But the 50-year-old thinks the balance of power has well and truly shifted in City’s favour. ‘In my first couple of years at United I didn’t understand the rivalry with City. Liverpool and Leeds were much bigger,’ Schmeichel told BBC Sport. ‘Now it’s different. Man City are the champions, they won their second Premier League title last season and maybe at the moment they are a bigger club than Manchester United in terms of results so the significance has changed.’ The Champions League winner is still very much a United fan, though, and admits playing against Sir Alex Ferguson’s team in City blue was a ‘very weird’ experience. Like many other United supporters, Schmeichel has become concerned by the inconsistency shown by the team since Ferguson retired. ‘The derby is a tricky one for United because of their inconsistency,’ he said. ‘We don’t know what we will get on Sunday.’ Schmeichel shouts instructions to the outfield players during a match for Manchester City.

Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9×1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements. The very heaviest elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so short that they are not found in nature and must be synthesized.  Paragraph: David was studying for his chemistry exam. To understand the elements of the periodic table better he categorized them into three groups, cat A, cat B, and cat C. In cat A he placed all the elements with atomic numbers lower than 83. In cat B he put the elements with atomic numbers from 83 to 94. Finally, in cat C he placed the elements with atomic numbers over 94. He found it easier to see their differences after he categorized them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would cat B more likely or less likely show radioactive decay than cat A?

A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel.

The paste, a volatile chemical compound, was reacting violently to the moisture on his skin, and now, with horrifying quickness, the fiery tendrils were consuming him entirely. Chris sprinted out the door, immediately feeling the intense heat billowing behind him as de Kere's agonized screams pierced the air. He knew that he had only seconds before the fire reached the stockpile of unstable compounds located throughout the establishment. And so, without looking back, he dedicated all his efforts to evacuating the premises. As he raced through the corridors, Chris shouted for everyone to get out, alerting other knights and personnel to the impending disaster. Panic gripped the halls as other inhabitants of the building scrambled to evacuate, heedless of the belongings they were leaving behind. Amid the chaos, Chris thought about de Kere—how the knight had become a victim of his own experiments, how his thirst for knowledge and power had led him to this terrible and fiery end. Though he had warned de Kere of the dangers surrounding the paste, Chris couldn't shake the guilt he felt for unleashing such a destructive force upon the man. Perhaps he could have done more to prevent the catastrophe, yet the consequences now became undeniable. With adrenaline pumping fiercely through his veins, Chris burst through the main doors of the building and into the crowded streets, just as the first explosion rocked the structure. A timed cascade of blasts wiped out each section of the compound, reducing it to a heap of smoldering ruin. The shockwaves from the explosions knocked Chris and dozens of others off their feet, while shards of glass and debris rained down upon the unfortunate souls. Coughing and disoriented, Chris struggled to get up. He scanned the shocked faces around him, desperately searching for any friends or comrades who had managed to escape in time. Some were battered but alive; others, horrifyingly, were not so fortunate. As the reality of the situation started to sink in, Chris couldn't deny the part he had played in this disaster. He knew that he would never forget the image of de Kere, his eyes pleading, consumed by the very flame he had so desired to wield. Though he had escaped the flames that had claimed de Kere's life, he couldn't escape the guilt that smoldered within his own heart. \\"Watch it happen, pal,\\" the words Chris had uttered echoed hauntingly inside his mind. In the aftermath of the fiery incident, as he mourned the lives lost, Chris resolved to dedicate his life to finding safer methods and working toward a world of progress without destruction. He knew that if knowledge and ambition could lead to such devastation, then only wisdom and empathy could prevent further suffering.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters.  But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  What is an answer for this question: Which brother was more at risk for atherosclerosis? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Liam, the brother with high cholesterol, is more at risk for atherosclerosis. High cholesterol levels contribute to the formation of plaques on the arterial walls, which can lead to atherosclerosis, a disorder where cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits can restrict or even block the flow of blood, potentially leading to high blood pressure, a lowered oxygen supply, heart attack, or even death. Meanwhile, Rudy's cholesterol and triglycerides are within normal parameters, making him less likely to develop atherosclerosis compared to Liam."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"A migratory bird has shrunk in stature as temperatures warm at its Arctic breeding ground, according to research.\\"","output":"Title: Little Birdie's Big Change: How Warming Temperatures Affect Migratory Birds Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about a special type of bird and how the changing weather in their home is making them smaller. These birds have a big journey every year and are called migratory birds. First, let's learn what migratory birds are. Imagine if you had to travel a long, long way every year to find a new home because the place where you lived got too cold or there wasn't enough food. Well, that's what migratory birds do! They travel from one part of the world to another during different seasons because the weather changes and it becomes hard for them to find food. Now, let's talk about the little birdie who loves to live in the Arctic. The Arctic is a very cold place, way up in the far north where the icebergs float and polar bears roam. This little birdie likes to make its home in the cold Arctic during the warm summer months, but as the weather in the Arctic gets warmer, something strange is happening to it. Researchers, who are like detective scientists, have found out that this little birdie is becoming smaller! That means it's not growing as big as it used to. They think this might be happening because of the warmer temperatures at the bird's Arctic home. Warmer weather can sometimes make it harder for these birds to find the food they need to grow big and strong, like bugs, worms, and seeds. You might wonder why this is important for us to know. Well, when we learn about how weather changes affect the plants, animals, and other living things on our planet, we can understand our world better. We can also help protect these special birds and their habitats by taking care of our environment. For example, we can do simple things like planting more trees, saving water, and recycling. These small acts can make a big difference in helping our planet stay healthy and happy, so our little birdie friends can continue their amazing journey every year. So, remember, little friends, every time you help the Earth, you are helping the migratory birds too, including our little Arctic birdie that's becoming smaller because of the warmer weather. Let's keep learning and taking care of our beautiful planet together!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Real Madrid sealed a record-extending 32nd La Liga title after Wednesday's 3-0 win at Athletic Bilbao maintained an unassailable seven-point lead over arch rivals and defending Spanish champions Barcelona with two matches to play. Goals from Gonzalo Higuain, Mesut Ozil and Cristiano Ronaldo wrapped up the clinching victory for Jose Mourinho's men at San Mames. Mourinho has now won league titles in Portugal with Porto, England with Chelsea, Italy with Inter and Spain with Real, who broke Barcelona's three-year La Liga reign. \\"This one has been the toughest. I've won seven league titles overall and I know what it feels like,\\" Mourinho told the club's website. \\"Barcelona won all their games, as befits the great team that they are. They've been winning to the very last day. They are a club with great tradition that knows we deserved to win this title.\\" Earlier on Wednesday, Barca thrashed fourth-placed Malaga 4-1 to keep up the pressure on Real as Lionel Messi scored his eighth hat-trick this season and broke Gerd Muller's record for a European season. Argentina's three-time world player of the year now has 68 goals in 2011-12, going past the mark Germany legend Muller set in 1972-73 for Bayern Munich. It took Messi's tally in La Liga to 46, two more than Ronaldo, but his efforts have proved in vain. Real's trip to the Europa League finalists looked a tough one, and when Ronaldo saw an early penalty saved by Gorka Iraizoz, their small band of supporters might have been worried. But Argentina striker Higuain settled nerves with a fine strike before Ronaldo played in Ozil for a second to make it 2-0 at halftime. Early in the second half the Portugal star netted his 44th in the league this season with a close-range header, and Bilbao's last hopes of salvaging something from the game ended when Javi Martinez was sent off for a second yellow card. At the finish Mourinho was hoisted high by his players as they celebrated the club's first championship since 2008. \\"We have to celebrate this championship. We have to continue working after tomorrow because next season will also be tough and we have games to play still in this campaign,\\" the 49-year-old said. \\"This team deserves even more emotion and affection, and I expect the Bernabeu to give it to them in our match against Mallorca.\\" The Dutch title was also decided on Wednesday as Ajax Amsterdam beat VVV Venlo 2-0 with goals in each half from Siem De Jong. It is Ajax's second straight title under Frank de Boer and came after a late-season charge with 13 straight wins. Ajax were eight points behind joint leaders PSV Eindhoven and AZ Alkmaar in mid-February before their unstoppable run. In Serie A, Juventus' lead was cut to a single point after being held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Lecce. Second-placed AC Milan beat Atalanta 2-0 to revive their hopes on a night Juve could have clinched the title if results had gone in their favor. Sulley Muntari put Milan ahead in the San Siro and Robinho sealed a vital victory in injury time. In Turin, Juventus appeared to be cruising to a routine home win when Claudio Marchisio scored in the first half. Lecce's hopes appeared over when Juan Cuadrado was sent off for a second booking early in the second half, but the leaders wasted a string of chances before Andrea Bertolacci took advantage of a horrible error by home keeper Gianluigi Buffon to level. In other action, Inter Milan's Champions League chances receded with a 3-1 loss at Parma which left the 2010 European titleholders three points behind Napoli and Udinese in the race for third place. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- Real Madrid won their 32nd La Liga title, achieving an unassailable seven-point lead over rivals Barcelona with two matches remaining. - Goals from Gonzalo Higuain, Mesut Ozil, and Cristiano Ronaldo secured Real Madrid's victory against Athletic Bilbao. - Coach Jose Mourinho has now won league titles in Portugal with Porto, England with Chelsea, Italy with Inter, and Spain with Real Madrid. - Barcelona won 4-1 against Malaga, with Lionel Messi scoring his eighth hat-trick for the season and breaking Gerd Muller's record for a European season with 68 goals. - In the Dutch league, Ajax Amsterdam won their second consecutive title under Frank de Boer after beating VVV Venlo 2-0. - In Serie A, Juventus' lead was reduced to a single point after drawing 1-1 against 10-man Lecce.

A: full of energy  B: dedicated  C: exhausted Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, Kai is practicing intently on a daily basis, and the training sessions are described as really hard and fast paced. Such intense physical activity generally demands a lot from the body, significantly consuming body energy, thus leading one to feel physically drained. Therefore, the most suitable answer to the question \\"How would Kai feel afterwards?\\" would be C: exhausted.  The other choices do not accurately represent Kai's condition as a result of these practices. Answer A: \\"full of energy,\\" suggests that Kai would feel energized after the practice sessions. However, given the intensity and frequency of the practice sessions, it is unlikely that Kai would be full of energy afterwards; instead, he is more likely to be tired. Answer B: \\"dedicated,\\" pertains more to a mental state rather than a physical feeling after exercising. From the statement given, we can infer that Kai is dedicated because he is practicing every day, but this does not provide information on how he would physically feel afterward.  For these reasons, answer C: \\"exhausted\\" is the best choice and aligns best with the information given in the context as an intense and fast-paced practice schedule on a daily base would typically leave a person feeling tired and drained.

Caleb, the teenage son of prominent conservative columnist Jeff Jacoby and his wife, Laura, was last seen at around 12:30 pm on Monday, leaving both family and community members shaken and distressed. Caleb's disappearance has ignited a wave of concern, as the Brookline community and surrounding areas rally together in an effort to bring the missing teenager back home safely. The Brookline Police Department has been tirelessly working on the case, with support from local and state police agencies, as well as numerous community members and volunteers who have dedicated their time to searching the nearby streets and neighborhoods. Residents of Brookline have been distributing flyers bearing Caleb's photo and several groups have embarked on grassroots searches throughout the area, extending their efforts to neighboring towns and cities. Social media has also played a significant role in raising awareness, as several \\"Help Find Caleb Jacoby\\" pages have cropped up on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These groups have been coordinating search efforts, sharing information and updates, and urging the public to keep an eye out for any signs of the missing teenager. The teenager, who is reported to have brown hair, green eyes, and stands at 5'11\\" tall, was last seen wearing khaki pants, a navy polo shirt, black sneakers, a blue and white New England Patriots hat, and carrying a monogrammed burgundy backpack. Police encourage anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, to come forward and provide any leads that might aide in locating Caleb. His father, Jeff Jacoby, is a highly-regarded journalist and conservative columnist for The Boston Globe. He has been an influential figure in the local and national media scene for several years and is often praised for his insightful analyses and sharp wit. The family's anguish has been widely publicized, with both Jeff and Laura Jacoby expressing their heart-wrenching pain and gratitude for the support they have received from the community in their search for Caleb. \\"This is every parent's nightmare, and we are living it,\\" Mr. Jacoby said in a statement to the media, \\"Every moment without knowing where Caleb is or what has happened to him is an eternity of torture.

The description only mentions that the Merdeka Palace is one of the six presidential palaces in Indonesia and serves as the official residence of the President of the Republic of Indonesia, along with its location in Central Jakarta. To determine whether the palace has marbled floors, further information about the palace's interior design and construction would be required. The Merdeka Palace, historically known as Istana Gambir or Paleis te Koningsplein during colonial times, is one of the most prominent and historically significant buildings in Indonesia. It has been used for various governmental and ceremonial purposes since its inception, and its architectural style is an intricate mix of local and European influences. It is possible that the palace features marbled floors, owing to its status and history, but without additional information, it cannot be confirmed. The palace has undergone several renovations and extensions throughout its existence, and the materials used for flooring may have changed over time due to practical or aesthetic reasons. However, as the building serves as the official residence of the President of the Republic of Indonesia, it is likely to feature high-quality materials and finishes, which may include marble flooring. If you are interested in learning more about the interior design and specific features of the Merdeka Palace, such as the presence of marbled floors, it would be beneficial to consult primary sources like photographs, descriptions in historical documents, or accounts from people who have visited the palace. Additionally, you could search for any architectural plans, government records, or publications that detail the palace's construction and renovations to learn more about its materials and design elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So is Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. They didn’t grow up with money or the finer things in life, they weren’t offered “legacy” preferences for college, and they didn’t get a trophy on the soccer field just because they showed up. They worked hard and found their support through family, teachers and mentors. But what makes them tick? That’s what I wanted to know. Andrea Guendelman, cofounder and CEO of BeVisible, was curious as well, so together we asked the women we’re featuring in our Self-Made Women series what they believe are the top 10 traits of successful self-made women. Here’s what they said: Grit. There’s no doubt about it, self-made women have a fire inside them, a fuel that keeps them going through hell and high water . When you come across a self-made woman, you can feel it in her presence. She exudes an undeniable energy of conviction and resolve. It’s almost as if she’s always in the ‘on’ state, ready and open to anything. –Amira Polack (25) Youth Campaign Lead at SAP Self-aware. Self-made women are aware of who they are and have made meaning from the experiences that have shaped their worldview.Heightened self-awareness provides them with clarity, both personally and professionally, and this helps them to align their goals and objectives to their purpose and meaning. That’s a powerful combination. –Rumeet Billan (31) Social Entrepreneur & President, Jobs in Education Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx is a self-made woman. Visionary. Self-made women are able to see beyond the way things are and create something new. They are able to see opportunities where others see obstacles and unfairness. And while others often get taken out by what seems impossible, self-made women are inspired into action to construct a new reality no matter how deep or systemic the scraps. –Rachel Armstrong (34) Founder, Executive Director and Attorney at Farm Commons Self-forgiving. Self-made women look at the past, the darkest moments and poorest choices with compassion, knowing they did the best they could with the resources and tools at the time. They release the weight of regretful actions and free themselves from judgment.–Maranda Pleasant (36), Founder/Editor-in-Chief ORIGIN Magazine, Mantra Yoga + Health Magazine, Thrive Magazine Focused. Self-made women have the ability to weed out what’s important and what’s not, what needs to be addressed immediately and what can wait. They know when to say ‘yes’, but more importantly, they know when to say ‘no’ . –Jessica Teal (38) Principal, Teal Media What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text outlines ten traits that commonly define self-made women, according to a variety of successful women: 1. **Grit**: Self-made women have a fiery determination, a fuel that keeps propelling them towards their goals, marked by a constant readiness and openness.     2. **Self-awareness**: They are conscious of who they are, making meaning out of their personal experiences that shape their worldview. This intrinsic insight provides personal and professional clarity, helping to align their goals with their purpose. 3. **Visionary**: They have the ability to transcend beyond existing situations and cultivate something innovative. They see opportunities where others observe hurdles and are driven by seemingly impossible circumstances. 4. **Self-forgiving**: They approach their past mistakes with empathy, understanding their limitations at that point in time. They let go of regret and guilt, liberating themselves from self-judgment. 5. **Focus**: The ability to discern the important from the insignificant and to know when to assert both agreement and refusal, underlies their decision-making abilities. The text emphasizes that the traits of grit, self-awareness, being visionary, self-forgiveness, and focus are critical to the growth and success of self-made women. Examples of such women include Oprah Winfrey, Sara Blakely, Amira Polack, Rumeet Billan, Rachel Armstrong, Maranda Pleasant, and Jessica Teal. Their experiences and perspectives gathered in their self-made journeys provide valuable insights into these characteristic traits.  In the broader context, these traits can be seen as universally beneficial constructs – not just for women aiming to become self-made and successful. Regardless of gender, anyone seeking personal and professional development can cultivate these traits for an enriching journey towards achievement and self-actualization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Andrew Cuomo of two inmates' escape from a maximum security prison yesterday in Dannemora in a turn of events he tells ABC News \\"could have been from the plot of a movie.\\" The movie comparison being bandied about is The Shawshank Redemption, and Sky News notes that escapees David Sweat and Richard Matt added a particularly dramatic touch: They left behind a taunting note bearing a smiley face and \\"Have a Nice Day!\\" But Cuomo, who ditched plans to attend yesterday's history-making Belmont Stakes, is quick to underscore that these are murderers who are \\"nothing to be trifled with.\\" Officials still don't know how the duo got their hands on power tools to cut through the wall, though Cuomo notes there are \\"a number of contractors working\\" on the Clinton Correctional Facility, which sits about 20 miles from the Canadian border. And apparently nobody is talking: \\"I chatted with a couple of the inmates myself and said, 'You must be a very heavy sleeper,' \\" Cuomo said. \\"They were heard, they had to be heard.\\" It's not Matt's first breakout, adds the New York Times: He escaped an Erie County jail in 1986. \\"The whole town’s locked down,\\" a local resident tells the Times. \\"You can’t drive anywhere. You can’t come into town. They’ve got detours all over the place. They’re checking trunks. It’s just something I’ve never seen before.\\" Says Cuomo: \\"I’m sure they knew that since it was the first escape it was going to be a big deal. But we'll get them back and we'll give them the note back.\\" Expand this summary.","output":"In a dramatic event reminiscent of a movie plot, two inmates escaped from the maximum-security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York in 2015. The two escapees, David Sweat and Richard Matt, were both convicted murderers who managed to obtain power tools and cut through the prison wall to make their escape. The incident marked the first breakout from the prison since 1865, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was determined to make it the last. The escape drew comparisons to the film \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" particularly due to the taunting note left behind by Sweat and Matt, which featured a smiley face and the message \\"Have a Nice Day!\\" Governor Cuomo, who canceled plans to attend the historic Belmont Stakes to address the situation, emphasized the seriousness of the escape, noting that the inmates were dangerous and \\"nothing to be trifled with.\\" At the time of the incident, officials did not know how Sweat and Matt acquired the power tools they used in their escape. Cuomo revealed that several contractors were working at the correctional facility, which is located approximately 20 miles from the Canadian border. Despite the use of power tools, no one reported hearing any noise during the escape. Governor Cuomo said, \\"I chatted with a couple of the inmates myself and said, 'You must be a very heavy sleeper. They were heard, they had to be heard.'\\" Interestingly, this was not Richard Matt's first escape from a correctional facility. He previously escaped an Erie County jail in 1986. The breakout from Clinton Correctional Facility put the town of Dannemora on high alert, with roadblocks, detours, and trunk searches in place to try to apprehend the escapees. One resident described the situation as \\"something I've never seen before.\\" Governor Cuomo was confident that the fugitives would be captured and vowed to return their taunting note to them. The escape led to an extensive manhunt and renewed focus on prison security in New York state, while also highlighting the challenges faced by law enforcement and corrections officials in preventing and responding to such incidents. Ultimately, the event served as a reminder of the importance of maintaining security in prisons and being diligent in ensuring that dangerous criminals are not able to escape and pose a threat to public safety."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

House training your Maltipoo is one of the most important and also the most difficult things that you will need to do when you first get her. House training involves developing a regular toileting schedule for your dog, cleaning up when your dog has an accident, and praising your dog when she goes to the bathroom outside.  Try placing some puppy pads or newspaper in a few places around the house in case your Maltipoo has an emergency and you are not around. Make sure that you take your dog out after he eats as well as a few more times in between. If you are often gone for long periods, then consider having a neighbor or friend stop by to let your dog out. Never yell at your dog, hit your dog, or rub your dog’s face in urine or feces. These methods of house training do not work and they will only frighten and confuse your dog.  You may also want to consider crate training your Maltipoo. Crate training can help with housetraining and it is also a good way to teach your Maltipoo not to chew on furniture, shoes, and other off-limits items. . Training your dog is an excellent way to make sure that he is well-behaved and that he listens to you. Training is also a great way to provide some mental stimulation for your dog and it can even serve as a bonding activity. Some good basic commands to teach your Maltipoo include:  Sit Stay Speak Down Heel . It is important to socialize your Maltipoo so that she will be calm in all sorts of different situations. After your Maltipoo’s first round of vaccinations at about eight weeks old, you can start to socialize her.  Be sure to expose your Maltipoo to people of all ages genders, races, and sizes, other dogs, cats, people dressed in unusual attire (hats, raincoats, boots, etc.), loud noises, crowds, and vehicles. Always keep your Maltipoo on a leash when you take her out in public. Give your Maltipoo lots of praise and petting for being curious and calm around new people and situations. If your Maltipoo gets scared, try to reassure her as much as you can or remove her from the situation if she becomes too nervous (trembling, barking, hiding, etc.) . Your Maltipoo needs lots of love, attention, and affection. You can provide her with these things by remembering to take time to play with your Maltipoo every day. Try heading out in the back yard for a game of fetch each day or take your Maltipoo with you on a walk around the neighborhood.  Provide fun toys.

Background: Sonny & Cher were an American pop music duo, actors, singers and entertainers made up of husband-and-wife Sonny and Cher Bono in the 1960s and 1970s. The couple started their career in the mid-1960s as R&B backing singers for record producer Phil Spector. The pair first achieved fame with two hit songs in 1965, \\"Baby Don't Go\\" and \\"I Got You Babe\\". Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, they released three studio albums in the late 1960s, as well as the soundtrack recordings for two unsuccessful movies, Good Times and Chastity, with Cher contributing vocals to one cut, \\"Chastity's Song (Band of Thieves)\\" . Context: In 1967 Sonny and Cher released their third album, In Case You're In Love. It peaked at number 45 in the U.S. charts. It contained two hit singles, both written by Bono, \\"The Beat Goes On\\" (No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100) and \\"Little Man\\" (No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100), that peaked at the number one in five European countries.  In an attempt to capitalize on the duo's initial success, Bono speedily arranged a film project for the duo to star in. But the 1967 feature, Good Times, was a major bomb, despite the efforts of fledgling director William Friedkin and co-star George Sanders. After Good Times flopped in 1968, Columbia Pictures immediately sold rights to their intended follow-up film Speedway to MGM. The couple were replaced by Elvis Presley and Nancy Sinatra. In 1969, another film, Chastity, starring Cher, written and produced by Sonny, was also a commercial bomb.  Sonny and Cher's career had stalled by 1968 as album sales quickly dried up. Their gentle, easy-listening pop sound and drug-free life had become unpopular in an era increasingly consumed with the psychedelic rock of the evolving landscape of American pop culture during the late 1960s.  Bono decided to forge ahead, carving a new career for the duo in Las Vegas resorts, where they sharpened their public persona with Cher as the wise-cracking singer, and Bono as the good-natured recipient of her insults. In reality, Bono controlled every aspect of their act, from the musical arrangements to the joke-writing. While success was slow to come, their luck improved when network TV talent scouts attended a show, noting their potential appeal for a variety series.  Sonny and Cher also welcomed their first child, Chastity Sun Bono, born on March 4, 1969. Question: Did they star in any other films during this time?. Whats the answer?","output":"During this period, Sonny and Cher starred in two films: Good Times (1967) and Chastity (1969).  Good Times was a comedy-musical film directed by William Friedkin and featured Sonny and Cher playing themselves in a series of comedy sketches that loosely followed their attempts to make a fictional movie, which was essentially a spoof of their music career. Despite the endeavors of Friedkin, who later achieved fame for directing The French Connection (1971) and The Exorcist (1973), and the presence of renowned actor George Sanders, Good Times failed both critically and commercially, making it a significant disappointment for the duo. Chastity, released in 1969, was a drama film starring Cher and written and produced by Sonny. The movie revolved around the character of Chastity, played by Cher, a runaway who experiences various hardships and adventures while hitchhiking throughout the American Southwest. Unfortunately, Chastity performed poorly at the box office and received negative reviews, further stalling Sonny and Cher's careers during this time. Despite the unsuccessful foray into film, Sonny and Cher transitioned to a successful career in television, headlining their own popular variety show, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, which aired from 1971 to 1974, and later The Sonny & Cher Show (1976–1977). These shows helped to re-establish their presence in the entertainment world and became the most prominent and enduring aspect of their careers during the 1970s."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We gave Tiger swimming lessons in our plastic wading pool. I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy.

While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. According to the above context, answer the following question. What happened before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written? Select from: + the Internet trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom. + publishing content. + the new generation of technology. + not enough information.

Scott) addresses his troops on the eve of battle. His uniform is impeccable, his medals uncountable, and his ramrod demeanor unassailable. As he speaks to the men about to embark on their first great adventure, his manner runs the gamut from stern, to jovial, amused, profane and reverent. To Patton, it is obvious that war is the greatest expression of the human condition.North Africa, 1942: In their first encounter with Rommel's Africa Corps, the Americans are badly beaten. In the post-battle assessment, Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) decides what's needed is the best tank commander they've got. Patton answers the call and arrives amid wailing sirens and a cloud of dust. He's also early and catches most of the soldiers off guard, a mistake they quickly learn not to make again. Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.In Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton. His reputation is considerable, and they study his idiosyncracies looking for a clue to the man's character. They note he is a romantic, reads the Bible daily, swears like a stableboy, and believes in reincarnation. Rommel, when asked what he intends to do about Patton, simply replies \\"I will attack and annihilate him.....before he does the same to me.\\"Soon the Germans move against the American positions in Tunisia, and Patton watches in fascination from his command post in the hills nearby.

In Hebrew, the name Omer is derived from the root word meaning \\"flourish\\" or \\"prosper,\\" which has a similar meaning to the Arabic interpretation. It can also refer to the Omer period, which is a 49-day period of counting between Passover and Shavuot in the Jewish calendar.

After a run-in with two locals, Neil (Sam Worthington) and Collin (Damien Richardson), the cruise winds to a close and Kate prepares to return the group to base. Everett (Robert Taylor) spots a flare in the distance, and Kate tells the group that they must investigate to determine whether someone needs rescuing. A few miles up river, they come across a half-sunken wreck when suddenly, something crashes into the tourists' boat, creating a crack in the side. Kate's only choice is to run it ashore on a small island in the middle of the river. The group disembarks and begins discussion of what to do when Everett is suddenly pulled into the water by an unseen predator and killed. Kate comes to the conclusion that they are in the heart of a large crocodile's territory and that it will be more aggressive than usual. The tourists realize that by nightfall, the tide will start to rise and in a matter of hours, their small island will be submerged. Neil and Collin arrive soon after, and as they near the island, an unseen force, smashes their boat and sinks it. Neil manages to swim to the island safely, but Collin disappears. As night falls, Neil suggests that he swims to the riverbank in order to string a rope between two trees, creating a zip-line that will allow the group to cross the river.

The BCCI will receive 405m (£319m) over the cycle of 2016 to 2023 - three times more than England's 139m (£110m), the second largest share. The International Cricket Council's board had voted 13-1 in favour of India being allocated 293m (£227m) in April. That led to reports India were planning to boycott the Champions Trophy. After the vote - on proposals for a new financial model intended to redistribute revenue more equally - the BCCI missed the deadline to name a squad for the tournament. A team was later selected, with India eventually losing in the final to Pakistan, but a BCCI statement explaining the delay said its secretary Amitabh Choudhary would continue to negotiate with the ICC, adding that it was \\"keeping its legal options open\\". The changes to the ICC's revenue distribution model, ratified by its full council on Thursday, will see South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, New Zealand and West Indies receive 128m (£101m) each, while Zimbabwe will receive 94m (£74m). Ireland and Afghanistan, who on Thursday were granted Test status, will share 240m (£189m) of funding with the ICC's associate members. by BBC sports news correspondent Joe Wilson There is a logic in some circles of Indian cricket which runs; 'if we generate 70% of income in the global game, shouldn't we get 70% of the revenue?' It's an argument the ICC has had to confront, keeping India on board while trying to ensure some equity in financial distribution. After all, it is a global game (even if India - and the IPL in particular - is in a world of its own with a global marketplace within its own borders). Thus it was back in April that the ICC board voted in a financial package that saw India take 293m over the next cycle. Discontent followed, as did mutterings of not participating in the Champions Trophy. Now the compromise gives them 405m, which is significantly more, but nowhere near the figure approaching 600m hardliners may have wanted. Where does the extra money to distribute to India come from? After all, the ICC now has two new full members to fund. Well, Ireland and Afghanistan will see their income increased dramatically but will still be a long way behind Zimbabwe. If not in cricketing terms, then in finances. This article was about:","output":"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) receiving 405 million (£319 million) over the 2016 to 2023 cycle, which is three times more than England's 139 million (£110 million), the second-largest share. The International Cricket Council's (ICC) board had initially voted 13-1 in favor of allocating 293 million (£227 million) to India in April, leading to reports that India was planning to boycott the Champions Trophy. The ICC's revenue distribution model was later changed, and it was ratified by its full council. The changes resulted in South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and West Indies receiving 128 million (£101 million) each, while Zimbabwe received 94 million (£74 million). Ireland and Afghanistan, who were granted Test status, would share 240 million (£189 million) in funding with the ICC's associate members. The compromise aimed to keep India on board while ensuring some equity in financial distribution within the global game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which friend received more interferon?  Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection.  Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. The answer to this question is:","output":"Nigel received more interferon. Because Nigel had a viral infection (HIV), it is more likely that he would be treated with antiviral drugs such as interferon or antiretroviral therapy (ART), which are specifically designed for treating viral infections.

Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","output":"The sentiment embodied by the tweet \\"Goodbye Twitter\\" can be perceived as a mixture of emotions that ultimately lead to the person's decision to depart from the popular social media platform. The sentiment can consist of various feelings such as frustration, sadness, liberation, disillusionment, and even relief. Here's an analysis of these emotions and why someone might express \\"Goodbye Twitter.\\" 1. Frustration: The user might be expressing their frustration with the Twitter platform or the behavior of other users on the platform. They may have faced negative or toxic interactions that have left them feeling annoyed or disheartened with their experience. These could include trolling, harassment, or cyberbullying. 2. Sadness: The user could be feeling a sense of sadness or loss as they bid farewell to Twitter. They may have invested time and energy into building relationships and engaging with others on the platform and could be mourning the end of those connections. 3. Liberation: Conversely, the user might experience a feeling of liberation as they decide to leave Twitter. In choosing to detach from the platform, the user may feel free from the constraints and pressures that come with maintaining an online persona or participating in digital exchanges. 4. Disillusionment: The tweet could also be an expression of the user's disillusionment with the nature of social media itself, where they believe that the platform is no longer serving its intended purpose of connecting people and fostering meaningful discourse. Instead, they may feel that Twitter has become more about promoting superficial or negative interactions, fostering echo chambers, or encouraging the spread of misinformation. 5. Relief: Lastly, the sentiment of \\"Goodbye Twitter\\" might also signify relief for the user, as they can now distance themselves from the constant bombardment of information, opinions, and updates that are inherent to social media platforms. By stepping away from Twitter, they might feel a sense of relief from the feeling of being perpetually connected and an alleviation of the pressures brought on by the digital world. Given the nature of the tweet, the sentiment analysis suggests the user's desire to break away from the platform for one or many reasons as outlined above. Whether it stems from an unpleasant experience, general disillusionment, or merely a quest for liberation from the digital world, this tweet navigates the complex realm of emotions tied to one's engagement with social media platforms like Twitter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does Tucker's foot become? Movie title: Black Sheep Movie plot: A young Henry Oldfield (Nick Fenton) lives on a sheep farm in New Zealand, with his father and older brother, Angus. After witnessing his father's pride on Henry's natural ability at farming, Angus plays a cruel prank on him involving the bloody corpse of his pet sheep, just moments before Mrs. Mac, the farm's housekeeper, comes to tell the boys that their father has been killed in an accident. The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling phobia of sheep. Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret genetic experiments that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty demonic half-sheep monstrosity. While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of environmental activists named Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) accidentally release a mutant lamb. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep. Meanwhile, Henry and an old friend, Tucker (Tammy Davis), decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it. Inside they find the mutilated body of a farmer. Henry sees a sheep in the hallway and, because of his phobia, he quietly shuts the door and locks it. The sheep tries to crash through the door. Tucker shoots the sheep. On the other end of the farm, Angus is driving around when he sees Grant. Grant bites Angus and runs off.

Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price.

There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous.

Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said. Under the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high 700 billion for 2018 — fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge. \\"We took care of the military like it's never...

Mulvany probably thinks that: A:","output":"The budget proposal serves as an important messaging document about Trump's priorities, even though it has little chance of becoming law.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution: 1. Write down the given equation:    -27*t = -24*t - 9 2. Add 24*t to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -24*t term from the right side of the equation and bring all the t terms to the left side:    -27*t + 24*t = -24*t + 24*t - 9    Simplify:    -3*t = -9 3. Now, to isolate t in the equation, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of t, which is -3:    (-3*t) / (-3) = (-9) / (-3) 4. By performing the division, we find the value of t:    t = 3 Finally, the solution of the equation -27*t = -24*t - 9 for variable t is: t = 3"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.

Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy.

In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001--2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration. The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses. is it illegal to play zone in the nba?","output":"No, it is not illegal to play zone defense in the NBA. Zone defenses were once prohibited in the NBA, but this changed during the 2001-2002 season when the league allowed teams to adopt zone defenses as part of their defensive strategies. Although zone defenses are now permitted, most NBA teams do not rely heavily on them as their primary defensive strategy. One reason for the limited use of zone defenses in the NBA is the existence of the defensive three-second violation rule. This rule makes it challenging to employ zone defenses effectively, as it prohibits a defensive player from being in the key area (also known as the paint) for more than three seconds without actively guarding an offensive player. Since traditional zone defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to prevent dribble penetration, the defensive three-second violation rule can hinder the success of these strategies. Despite these potential obstacles, there are still NBA teams that use zone defenses successfully, such as the Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle. The Mavericks have been known to employ zone defenses as part of their defensive game plan.  In conclusion, while zone defenses are not illegal in the NBA, their usage is relatively limited due to the restrictions imposed by the defensive three-second violation rule. However, some teams do occasionally incorporate zone defenses into their strategies to disrupt opposing offenses and capitalize on the elements of surprise and versatility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It wasn't a big house or a car. It wasn't cash or gold. In the eyes of the world my father died a poor man. He was a simple mechanic who worked hard to support his family. My father's treasure, rather, was in a thousand wonderful memories that he gave me over the course of his life.  One particular one stood out in my mind today. I was just a boy playing in the backyard of a friend's house while my father spent the afternoon under the hood   of an old car, trying to get it running again. It seemed to take hours and I wasn't sure whether he could bring the ancient car back to life again this time. At long last, though, he closed the hood and turned the key in the ignition  . There was a sweet smile of satisfaction on his face as the engine started. There was a twinkle of joy in his eye when he shook his head. And there was a quiet hum of happiness in his voice as we drove back home that day. This memory made a home in my heart and became a priceless pearl for my soul to cherish. Time and time again, my father showed me that a kind life, a giving life and a heavenly life was created one choice at a time. Not all of his choices were the right ones, but most of them were. He did the best he could. He lived the best he could. And he helped to bring out the best in me, too.

US faces calls to ‘walk away’ from Iran talks A leading Republican critic of the Iranian nuclear talks is calling on the U.S. to \\"walk away\\" from the table after negotiators missed a key deadline, while other lawmakers joined in voicing concern that Iran could extract critical final-hour concessions in the scramble to salvage an agreement. Negotiations resumed in Switzerland on Wednesday but were almost immediately beset by competing claims, just hours after diplomats abandoned a March 31 deadline to reach the outline of a deal and agreed to press on. And as the latest round hit the week mark, three of the six foreign ministers involved left the talks with prospects for agreement remaining uncertain. Amid the confusion, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker. \\"You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran,\\" Cotton said. \\"And the fact that they're not willing to do that, that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West.\\" Speaking on MSNBC, former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is \\"right\\" to seek a deal, it might be time to \\"step away\\" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief. \\"I am worried about this,\\" Dean said. Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., also told Fox News \\"we're potentially [legitimizing] them having a nuclear infrastructure.\\" She added: \\"We don't know exactly what's behind closed doors.\\" Despite all sides agreeing to blow by their deadline in pursuit of a rough agreement, even the White House threatened to abandon the talks if Iran wouldn't budge. \\"If they're unwilling to make those kinds of commitments that give us that assurance -- and by us I mean not just the United States, I mean the international community -- then we'll have to walk away from the negotiating table and consider what other options may be available to us, and there is certainly the possibility that that could happen,\\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. Earnest indicated Wednesday that's still an option but called the scenario \\"hypothetical\\" as talks are \\"making some progress.\\" He said talks continue to be \\"productive\\" but that \\"we have not yet received the specific, tangible commitments we and the international community require.\\" On Tuesday, negotiators had been trying to agree to simply a joint statement that could justify talks continuing until a final June deadline. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters that if the sides make progress on the text of a joint statement, then that could be issued by the end of the day. But he suggested the statement would contain no specifics. A senior western official quickly pushed back, saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The German Foreign Ministry tweeted that \\"nothing is agreed,\\" although \\"progress is visible.\\" Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief on his country as one dispute, along with disputes on Iran's uranium enrichment-related research and development. \\"Definitely our research and development program on high-end centrifuges should continue,\\" he told Iranian television. The U.S. and its negotiating partners want to crimp Iranian efforts to improve the performance of centrifuges that enrich uranium because advancing the technology could let Iran produce material that could be used to arm a nuclear weapon much more quickly than at present. The exchanges reflected significant gaps between the sides, and came shortly after the end of the first post-deadline meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, his British and German counterparts and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif in the Swiss town of Lausanne. They and their teams were continuing a marathon effort to bridge still significant gaps and hammer out a framework accord that would serve as the basis for a final agreement by the end of June. Eager to avoid a collapse in the discussions, the United States and others claimed late Tuesday that enough progress had been made to warrant an extension after six days of intense bartering. But the foreign ministers of China, France and Russia all departed Lausanne overnight, although the significance of their absence was not clear. Kerry postponed his planned Tuesday departure to stay in Lausanne, and an Iranian negotiator said his team would stay \\"as long as necessary\\" to clear the remaining hurdles. Officials say their intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In addition, they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals. The additional documents would allow the sides to make the case that the next round of talks will not simply be a continuation of negotiations that have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany was concluded in November 2013. Obama and other leaders, including Iran's, have said they are not interested in a third extension. But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved, Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new, stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to question the course of talks on Wednesday. He said Iran views Israel's destruction as non-negotiable, \\"but evidently giving Iran's murderous regime a clear path to the bomb is negotiable. This is unconscionable,\\" he said. \\"At the same time, Iran is accelerating its campaign of terror, subjugation and conquest throughout the region, most recently in Yemen.\\" Netanyahu said a better deal would \\"significantly roll back Iran's nuclear infrastructure\\" and link a lifting of restrictions on its nuclear program to \\"a change in Iran's behavior.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"This text revolves around the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, with a heavy emphasis on political reactions to, and the potentially adverse outcomes of, the negotiations. Amongst the most important aspects are: 1) Missing the Key Deadline: Negotiators missed a crucial March 31 deadline to reach the outline of the agreement. Despite this, the discussion continued, indicating a commitment from the negotiators. Some critics were alarmed, however, suggesting that this could lead to harmful concessions from the U.S. due to a desperate scramble to seal a deal. 2) Differing Claims: After the resumption of negotiations, conflicting claims vexed the progress. For instance, Iran's deputy foreign minster Abbas Araghchi implied that the US is willing to move forward without a detailed, joint statement, while a senior Western official contradicted that assertion.  3) Departure of Foreign Ministers: Three of the six foreign ministers left the talks, which cast more uncertainty over their prospects.   4) U.S Domestic Reactions: Strong concerns were expressed by several U.S. officials. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark), and Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz) disapproved of the ongoing negotiations, fearing that the U.S. was granting too many concessions. Former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean also voiced his worries and appeared to align with Republican critics. This cross-party consensus on potential issues with the negotiation may make it harder for a deal to be ratified domestically.  5) Opposition from Israel: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his previous concerns about the talks and Iran's intentions, prodding for a deal that could restrict Iran's nuclear advancements and change its international demeanor. 6) The White House's Stance: Despite the mounting domestic and international pressures, the White House opted for patience and chose to persist with negotiations. They conveyed a willingness to walk away if Iran does not provide sufficient commitments, but emphasized that they were making some progress. 7) Specific Concerns in the Talks: The U.S. aims to curb Iranian efforts to improve performance of centrifuges that enrich uranium. Iran, however, wants relief from sanctions. 8) Sustainability of Talks: There seems to be a unanimous unwillingness to extend the talks for a third time, after already being extended twice since reaching an interim agreement in 2013. But opposition from Congress, who might impose new sanctions on Iran, threatens the diplomatic path.  9) Iran’s Behavior: The reiterations of Iranian-backed violence in Yemen and general regional instability are pointed to as reasons to distrust Iran’s intentions behind the negotiating table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Palmer was born to Doris (Morrison) and Milfred Jerome \\"Deacon\\" Palmer (1905-1976) in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, a working-class steel mill town. He learned golf from his father, who had suffered from polio at a young age and was head professional and greenskeeper at Latrobe Country Club, which allowed young Arnold to accompany his father as he maintained the course. Palmer attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship. He left upon the death of close friend Bud Worsham (1929-1950) and enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard, where he served for three years, 1951-1954. Palmer was married to the former Winnie Walzer (1934-1999) for 45 years; the couple had two daughters. She died at age 65 on November 20, 1999, from complications due to ovarian cancer. His grandson, Sam Saunders, is a professional golfer who grew up playing at Bay Hill, where he won the club championship at age 15. He attended Clemson University in South Carolina on a golf scholarship and turned pro in 2008. Saunders stated that Palmer's family nickname is \\"Dumpy\\". He married his second wife, Kathleen Gawthrop, in 2005 in Hawaii.  During the spring and summer months, Palmer resided in Latrobe, and he spent winters in Orlando and La Quinta, California. He first visited Orlando in 1948 during a college match. When he took up residence in Orlando, Palmer helped the city become a recreation destination, \\"turning the entire state of Florida into a golfing paradise\\". That included building one of the premier events on the PGA Tour there along with his contributing to new hospitals. On hearing about Palmer's death, Tiger Woods said, \\"My kids were born at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies, and his philanthropic work will be remembered along with his accomplishments in golf.\\" Arnold Palmer Boulevard is named in his honor.  Palmer had supported Scottish football club Rangers F.C. since his boyhood. He was a member of the Freemasons since 1958. Palmer created the Arnie's Army Charitable Foundation to help children and youth. The Foundation saw the creation of the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies Center, The Howard Philips Center for Children & Families, the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, and the Winnie Palmer Nature Reserve. He was also a spokesman for Hertz Rent-a-Car with O. J. Simpson.  During his playing career, Arnold Palmer smoked cigarettes, which caused him to battle an addiction to nicotine. He noted that many of his colleagues smoked, and he even endorsed the product in television commercials. Later in life, Palmer made a complete about-face and urged the public to give up smoking. He said that cigarette smoking has a negative effect on every organ in the body.

Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\",  answer the following question.

Background: Colbert was born in Washington, D.C., the youngest of 11 children in a Catholic family. He spent his early years in Bethesda, Maryland. He grew up on James Island, South Carolina. Colbert and his siblings, in descending order by age, are James III, Edward, Mary, William, Margo, Thomas, Jay, Elizabeth, Paul, Peter, and Stephen. Context: While at Northwestern, Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic at a time when the project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. \\"I wasn't gonna do Second City\\", Colbert later recalled, \\"because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv - there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people\\". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.  Shortly thereafter, he was hired to perform with Second City's touring company, initially as an understudy for Steve Carell. It was there he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello, with whom he often collaborated later in his career. By their retelling, the three comedians did not get along at first - Dinello thought Colbert was uptight, pretentious and cold, while Colbert thought of Dinello as \\"an illiterate thug\\" - but the trio became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility.  When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions, Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work with them on the sketch comedy show Exit 57. The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series.  Following the cancelation of Exit 57, Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on The Dana Carvey Show, alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell, and also Robert Smigel, Charlie Kaufman, Louis C.K., and Dino Stamatopoulos, among others. The series, described by one reviewer as \\"kamikaze satire\\" in \\"borderline-questionable taste\\", had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes. Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for Saturday Night Live with Robert Smigel. Smigel brought his animated sketch, The Ambiguously Gay Duo, to SNL from The Dana Carvey Show; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series, opposite Steve Carell as Gary. Needing money, he also worked as a script consultant for VH1 and MTV, before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for Good Morning America. Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired, but the job led his agent to refer him to The Daily Show's then-producer, Madeline Smithberg, who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997. Question: What was he in college for ? Answer:","output":"Stephen Colbert was in college to study acting, with a focus on becoming a dramatic actor.

Question: How long os George and Jim's relationship? Movie title: A Single Man Movie plot: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a closing voiceover explains how he has rediscovered the ability \\"to feel, rather than think\\". As he...

Sputnikmusic's James Bishop agreed, claiming the band should be concerned by the \\"lack of experimentation or ambition\\" on the album. He again stated that the album was consistent, noting that \\"there actually isn't a bad song present\\".

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Get all of your stretching done first before you start singing. Move your neck in slow circles to stretch those muscles, or switch between a big smile and an open mouth in the shape of an ‘O’ to stretch your face. Do each exercise 5-10 times to stretch your muscles well.  Bend your head back and flex your tongue outwards to stretch your throat. Do 5 big yawns to stretch the muscles around your mouth. Focus on one stretch if you don't have much time, or do 5 of each exercise to practice multiple stretches in one sitting. This is when you make your voice imitate the sound of an ambulance’s siren, moving up to the higher notes, back down to lower notes, and then back up again in one continuous sound. This will help you find out what your full range is while stretching your vocal cords. These help you reach your maximum high note by trying to imitate the high pitched noise of a siren. Arpeggios are useful exercises that help you transition from the different major and minor scales. Singing arpeggios to different vowels or other sounds is a great way to extend your vocal range.  Go online to find videos of arpeggio scales for you to sing along with, helping you practice. You might sing \\"ee-ee-ee-ee-ee,\\" with the first and last \\"ee\\" being the lowest and the middle one being the highest note. Instead of being a continuous sound, arpeggios have very small pauses between each note. Vocal slides are a great way for you to gently reach high notes before coming back down. Use your voice to slide from a low note to a high note, and then back down as if your voice was on a swing.  Vocal slides are more controlled than vocal sirens, though they sometimes sound similar. Try humming your vocal slides or choosing a sound like “wooo” or “ahhh.” Vocal slides help relax your throat, making it easier for you to reach higher notes. While most of your early practicing should be focused on reaching the high notes briefly and then going back down, after you’ve mastered this skill, you can go even further. Once you reach your highest note, try to hold it for several seconds before going back down the scale.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems.  - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan.  - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components  electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services.

What am I paying for when I stay there for the night? The website also touted the clean linens. The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. The problem was with all of the down pillows etc. Don't they know that people have allergies? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. I think that this was another part of my symptoms. If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. Beware hidden costs. I will try somewhere else in the future. Not worth the money or the sneezing all night. A:","output":"Based on the content of the review, the sentiment expressed by the reviewer seems to be negative. Step 1: Analyzing the review: The reviewer mentions several elements that lead to dissatisfaction with the hotel - including the lack of free parking, allergy issues triggered by down pillows, extra charges at the end of the stay, and allowing pets which they considered as leading to allergic symptoms.  Step 2: Weighing the positive and negative sentiment: The reviewer does mention that the hotel was clean, and there was a belief that linens were clean but these positives are overshadowed by the multiple negatives.  Step 3: Classifying based on degree of sentiment: The fact that the reviewer ends the testimonial stating that they will try other places in the future, indicating they would not return to this hotel, is a strong signal of overall negative sentiment.

On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you'll be very disappointed. Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment:  * While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children's view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. * The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues. * In England, driving is on the left. The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when it could have easily parked immediately behind, or even on the side; as the huge truck did. * The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime, but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall. * Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting. * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk. * It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same-- while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park. * The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow/dimwitted --justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device But when he hosts an IAAF council conference call on Friday evening at a secret location in London, he will be aware that not only is his reputation on the line, but that of his sport. Coe and his 26 council colleagues must decide whether to suspend Russia from international athletics as punishment for the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) damning report. They are almost certain to do so. This is not a decision to take lightly. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the sport's governing body, has never before banned a nation for cheating. A few countries have been suspended for government interference, but not for state-sponsored doping. And this is Russia, one of the richest and most powerful sporting nations on earth, both as host and medallist. Next year alone, Russia is meant to be hosting May's World Race Walking championships in Cheboksary, and the Junior World Championships in Kazan in July. Both may have to be staged elsewhere if the threat of a suspension is carried out. And what sort of message would isolation send out with the 2018 World Cup on the horizon? But given that the IAAF itself is reeling from devastating accusations that it was an accomplice to the cheating, the pressure to be seen to act decisively, to set a proper example and to establish a real deterrent - as requested by one of the Wada report authors Dick Pound - has become intense. The IAAF's Constitutional Objects include \\"eradicating doping from the sport and safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of athletics\\". Russia appears to have flouted such a pledge, so a suspension seems certain. And with Pound admitting that all this is merely \\"the tip of the iceberg\\", if a precedent is set, then further bans in other countries and in other sports could well follow. A hearing will have to be held before any provisional suspension is fully signed off, but with that regarded as a formality, the main question of course is when such a ban would be lifted. The IAAF may well make the suspension indefinite, but set out conditions that Russia must meet before it is allowed to be reinstated. The sense is Russia will simply do what is required, say it has cleaned up its act, and be back in time for the big one - the Rio Olympics - next summer, making it look like a mere slap on the wrist. That is hardly something that will help win back confidence in the sport - or its new leader. Many will want the Russian federation to receive the same punishment that athletes get for cheating - a four-year ban. But International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach has already said he expects to see Russia participating in Rio. Even Pound suggested something similar. And with Russian President Vladimir Putin striking a rather conciliatory tone, it is easy to see where this is heading. In March 2016, the IAAF council will meet again in Cardiff. Do not be surprised if that is when Russia is able to prove it is now Wada-compliant again, and allowed back into the fold, to the inevitable howls of protest that athletics has not been tough enough. But whatever the IAAF decides to do, for its president Lord Coe, a dream job as the most powerful man in athletics risks becoming a nightmare. Media playback is not supported on this device The fact he was an IAAF vice-president for eight years before taking over from Lamine Diack - now under investigation by French prosecutors for accepting bribes to cover up doping - has led many to question whether he was either complicit in the wrongdoing, or, as he insists, just ignorant of it. Either way, it does not reflect well on a man who must now somehow rebuild trust in his sport. The last thing Coe needs is to appear like track and field's version of Fifa's Michel Platini or cycling's Pat McQuaid - an insider tarnished by association. Those close to Coe say his role as vice-president involved just a few meetings a year at the IAAF, that for most of that time he was far too busy organising the London 2012 Olympics to be across all that was going on in Monaco and he is genuinely stunned and horrified by what has been exposed. They also point out the criminal investigation into extortion allegations restricts what he can say and he should be judged on what he does now he is in power, rather than during his election campaign, when winning votes was the priority. All this may be true. But others make the point Coe has not helped himself. Why, they ask, did he lavish praise on his \\"spiritual\\" leader Diack in August when he succeeded him, despite plenty of warning signs - the outgoing president's son (along with other senior IAAF officials) had stood down last December, already under investigation by the IAAF's own ethics committee. Why did he describe media reports of a cover-up as \\"a declaration of war\\", and pour scorn on the \\"so-called experts\\" used by German broadcaster ARD and the Sunday Times to analyse leaked blood samples? Coe has said \\"it was not a criticism of any journalism or any media, it was simply a reaction to the selective use of data to call into question the reputation of clean athletes\\". But why does he continue to refuse an interview with Hajo Seppelt, the German investigative journalist who exposed the scandal? And why - when the IAAF had already charged several senior officials (including its anti-doping chief), and when it was already widely known that Wada's report would be terrible news for Russia - did he tell the BBC's Sportsweek programme on Sunday he would rather not ban countries - before hearing the full commission report? He was then forced into a humiliating U-turn the following evening, when a windswept Coe arrived at TV studios in Millbank, Westminster, and was put through a series of media grillings. During a long and overwhelmingly successful career as an athlete, politician and administrator, Coe has faced plenty of challenges, from chairing Fifa's ethics committee to advising former Conservative party leader William Hague. But nothing quite like this. The aura appears to have gone. The judgment seems, at times, to be missing. Despite concerns over a potential conflict of interest, Coe continues to refuse to give up his £100,000-a-year role as a special ambassador for sportswear giant Nike. Coe insists the arrangement is merely to support a corporate social responsibility project. And it is important to note the IAAF presidency is an unpaid role, so he has to earn a living elsewhere. But it does not help that Nike supplies Russian athletes with their kit, or that Coe appears to have a permanent parking bay at the company's headquarters. It does not help that their leading coach Alberto Salazar is under investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) over alleged doping violations, which he denies. It does not help that they sponsor two-time doper, US sprinter Justin Gatlin. It does not help that Eugene, a city with close links to the company, was awarded the 2021 athletics World Championships without a vote. Paul Sinton-Hewitt is the founder of Parkrun, the increasingly popular, non-profit running movement, that boasts two million registered members and 125,000 weekly runners. He describes Coe's Nike links as \\"unbelievable and bizarre\\". \\"Seb says he is doing everything in his power to clean up the sport,\\" he told the BBC. \\"I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt and to support him if he disinvests himself from any organisations which might have an influence over any decision that he may have to make. This means he should remove all personal ties with Nike - and with (sports marketing company) CSM. \\"Without this break I will continue to question his independence. He has to be whiter than white. It is absolutely wrong he should be getting income from anyone who could force him to be compromised. He now has very little time to prove he's the right man for the job.\\" Others are equally critical. Renee Anne Shirley, the whistleblower who exposed Jamaica's lack of testing levels told the Herald that Coe \\"had his head in the sand\\". British 400m runner Martyn Rooney - Team GB's captain at the World Championships in Beijing this summer - told the BBC: \\"It is pretty disrespectful to everyone involved in athletics to believe that the vice-president did not know what was going on within IAAF. \\"That is his job and if he believes he did not know what was going on he has not been doing his job properly.\\" Coe is not responsible for the crisis athletics finds itself in. It is not his fault that the worst doping scandal in sports history has been exposed so early in his tenure, or that athletics was already struggling for fans and sponsors with competition from much bigger and more popular sports, let alone now. It is not his fault that doping is a global problem. He is not to blame for the fact Wada seems drastically underfunded, and chronically compromised by a lack of independence from the very sports it has to get tough with. He is not to blame that the IOC signed a 7.75bn (£5.1bn) deal with NBC last year but only gives about 15m (£9.9m) a year to Wada (half its budget), or that Wada is not responsible for the testing of samples, with many labs under the jurisdiction of national governments or federations, with the obvious potential for a conflict of interest. It is not his fault that lifetime bans are not legally enforceable, and that in so few countries is doping a criminal offence. To be fair to Coe, he has been calling for an independent body to handle drug testing in track and field for some time. Media playback is not supported on this device It was Wada who failed to act on the information offered to its officials by Russian whistleblower Vitaly Stepanov back in 2013, and then an expose about Russian doping in the Mail on Sunday the same year. Coe cannot force the anti-doping community to follow UK Anti-Doping's lead and place more emphasis on intelligence and investigation. It is not down to him that the resources for testing regimes around the world are so inconsistent, and so simple for the cheats to evade, or that sports appear so incapable of running themselves properly, so vulnerable to people for whom power and wealth seem more important than integrity. It is not down to him that the boom in the money and status of sport has so incentivised cheating and political exploitation. In time these issues must be addressed but right now they offer Coe little comfort. He got his way and was elected to the job he wanted. Now it is his responsibility to salvage whatever credibility is left in his sport. He owes it to the clean athletes around the world who dedicate their lives to honest competition. He owes it to the volunteers who give up time for the sport they love and to the fans who will watch the action in Rio and wonder whether they can believe what they are seeing any longer. Athletics is yet to hit rock-bottom. That will come in due course when Wada's commission reveals more sordid details of this unbelievable scandal. This goes beyond Russia. But at least this week's events could just be a catalyst for change. Coe said he wanted to help his sport. Now he has the chance. Once, Coe may have thought he would be remembered for winning races. Later, that the triumph of London 2012 was how he would be judged. Instead, it turns out his days of reckoning are now. Sadly the task is proving harder than he could ever have imagined. A summary of the above article is?","output":"There's a big meeting happening with important athletics people. They need to decide if they should punish Russia and not let their athletes compete for a while because they cheated with drugs. This is a difficult decision because it might upset the upcoming events and it's never been done before. It's also important because it could affect other countries and sports later on. The man in charge, Lord Coe, is being criticized because some people think he knew about the cheating and didn't do anything. This is causing a lot of problems for him and for the sport of athletics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ruth has an office job in a small but stable company, where she spends most of her days trying to provide a decent life for her kids. On the other hand, Ruth's estranged ex-husband, Bob, is a laid-back, unsuccessful artist who, since their divorce, remains oblivious to the difficulties his family faces. After a long day, Ruth, who has a severe headache, mistakenly overdoses on her migraine medication causing her to black out. Her concerned neighbor finds her unconscious, calls an ambulance, and watches over the kids. The incident shakes Ruth - she realizes she cannot continue down this path of constant struggle and exhaustion. Grudgingly, she reaches out to Bob and asks if he can look after the kids for the following month, expressing her need for rest and recovery. Bob, caught off-guard by her request, reluctantly agrees. Act 2: Bob welcomes Emma and Jake into his chaotic, disorganized apartment, which doubles as his art studio. Initially, Bob struggles to adjust to his responsibilities as he juggles parenting, attempting to make art sales, and providing a healthy environment for the children. The children, uncertain about their new environment, have difficulty adjusting. However, over time, Bob finds a way to bond with the kids through his creativity by starting a mural project on one wall of his apartment. This project becomes a family activity, as Bob, Emma, and Jake each contribute their artistic ideas to create something special together.

A. free flowing  B. translucent  C. sparse  D. slender  E. clear  The best answer is Answer:","output":"C. sparse If an area is not thick with resources, it means that those resources are not abundant or densely available. In this context, the term \\"sparse\\" best fits the description. Sparse resources indicate that they are scattered or thinly distributed in a particular area, thereby making it challenging to locate and exploit these resources effectively.  To better understand the term, let's briefly review the other options: A. Free flowing: This term refers to something that moves or operates easily and smoothly. It does not necessarily pertain to the distribution or abundance of resources in an area. B. Translucent: This term deals with the capability of a material to transmit light without being fully transparent. It is unrelated to the distribution of resources. D. Slender: This term refers to something that is thin or narrow in width. While it may describe the size of a resource, it's not an accurate representation of resource distribution in an area. E. Clear: This term implies that there is no obstruction or hindrance, often in terms of visibility or comprehension. It does not pertain to the relative abundance of resources in an area.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: With both teams coming off of wins, the 2-1 Green Bay Packers will travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota to face the 3-0 Minnesota Vikings in a Monday Night Football showdown. The Vikings will be led by starting quarterback Brett Favre. The game started with the Packers in possession. After the offense moved the ball consistently down field down to the Minnesota 24-yard line, but Aaron Rodgers was then sacked by two Vikings defenders for a 9-yard loss and fumbled the football. The ball was recovered by Vikings linebacker Chad Greenway at the Vikings 33-yard line. After the turnover, Brett Favre took to the field clad in purple. The Vikings too seemed to also be able to move the ball just as effectively with multiple short runs by running back Adrian Peterson and throws by Brett Favre. The Vikings finally capped the 12-play, 67-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass short left from Brett Favre to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. With the score, the Vikings took the early 7-0 lead. The Packers then took to the field looking to make up for the turnover on their first possession of the game. On 3rd and 5 after an incompletion to Greg Jennings and a 5-yard run by fullback John Kuhn, Aaron Rodgers fired a pass to second year tight end Jermichael Finley deep middle in which he caught around the Vikings 35-yard line and then ran the ball the rest of the way into the end zone for a Packers 62-yard touchdown. With the extra point the game was now tied 7-7. The Vikings took to the field again, but after two incompletions and a completion for a 5-yard loss the Vikings were forced to punt. The Packers then took over at the Minnesota 43-yard line. The Packers again managed to move the ball quite effectively against the Vikings defense but like the first drive of the game, the drive ended with a turn over. This time it was an attempted short right pass to Greg Jennings from Aaron Rodgers that was intercepted by Antoine Winfield at the Vikings 23-yard line. Similar to the last drive after the Packers turned over the ball, the Vikings managed to move the ball effortlessly down to the Packers 14-yard line in which Brett Favre then connected with wide receiver Sidney Rice for Favre's second touchdown strike against the Packers. With the score the Vikings retook the lead at 14-7. The Packers then took to the field looking again to make up for another costly turnover, but the offense failed to move the ball and Aaron Rodgers was sacked on 3rd down forcing the Packers to punt. The Packers would level the score though on the Vikings next offensive play of the game. Vikings running back Adrian Peterson ran wide left and was stacked up behind the line of scrimmage. While he was being stopped, Packers rookie linebacker Clay Matthews ripped the ball away from Peterson and returned the ball untouched 42 yards for the Packers tying touchdown at 14-14. On the Vikings next possession looking to retake the lead, Favre and company compiled together a drive highlighted by a 43-yard pass from Brett Favre to Percy Harvin down to the Packers 3-yard line. On the next play, Favre dropped back to pass and the ball was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in the center of the end zone but the play was nullified by a defensive pass interference call paired with a defensive offside penalty. The pass inference penalty was accepted and the ball was placed on the Packers 1-yard line. On the next play Vikings running back Adrian Peterson rushed up the middle for the score to give the Vikings a 21-14 lead. The Packers took over with little time remaining but still attempted to put points on the board. After a 14-yard pass to Greg Jennings down to the Vikings 48-yard line, Aaron Rodgers took the team's final timeout with 1 second remaining. On the final play of the half Rodgers tossed a deep ball into a group of players the right corner of the end zone but the ball fell incomplete ending the half 21-14 in favor of the Vikings. The Vikings received the ball at the start of the second half, and managed to still move the ball effectively against the Packers defense that was getting virtually no pressure on Brett Favre. On second and ten at the Green Bay 44-yard line, Brett Favre connected with Jeff Dugan to the Green Bay 31 for 25 yards and then capped the drive with a 31-yard strike to receiver Bernard Berrian deep left for a touchdown to extend the Vikings lead to 28-14. The Packers then took to the field and managed to move the ball down field highlighted by a 24-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 20-yard pass to Ryan Grant down to the Minnesota 5-yard line setting the team up first and goal at the Vikings 5-yard line. On first down Ryan Grant ran up the middle for a four-yard gain. On second down the Packers tried a trick play that looked like a run wide right for Grant, but Rodgers handed the ball off to fullback John Kuhn who ran up the middle but the Vikings were not fooled and Kuhn's attempt to score a touchdown was stopped when his knee hit down at the line of scrimmage before lunging into the endzone. On third down, Rodgers connected with tight end Jermichael Finley who ran an out route to the right, but was tackled right after the reception at the line of scrimmage by Vikings linebacker Ben Leber for no gain. The Packers then choose to go for it on fourth down rather than settling the field goal. On the play, Rodgers looked right, then back left and passed to Packers tight end Donald Lee short middle, but Lee failed to catch the pass resulting in loss of downs and the Vikings took over possession at their 1-yard line. On the Vikings next drive that continued on into the final quarter of play, the Vikings managed to move the ball out of their own end zone down to their own 37-yard line, but the drive stalled on a 5-yard completed screen pass short of the first down marker on 3rd and 10. The Packers took over at their own 15-yard line, and Rodgers was sacked on first down. On second down Ryan Grant ran up the middle for 10 yards making up for the lost yardage on the sack and more. The drive came to an end though on the next play when quarterback Aaron Rodgers pretended to walk toward the sideline and the ball was directly snapped to backup running back DeShawn Wynn. Wynn managed to gain 6 yards on 3rd and 7, but falling a yard short on the trick play the Packers were forced to punt. The Viking offense then took to the field again, but the Packers defense held the Vikings on third down and they too were forced to punt. After another stellar punt by Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, the Packers were again pinned deep in their own end at their own 1-yard line. After two unsuccessful plays for no gain on first and second down, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by Jared Allen at the goal line and fumbled the football. The ball was recovered by the Vikings, but the ruling on the field was challenged by the Packers that the ground had caused the fumbled. The ruling on the field was then changed to a safety rather than giving the Vikings the ball at the Packers 1-yard line and the Vikings extended their lead to 30-14. After the safety the Packers kicked off and the Vikings took over at their 40-yard line.The Packers managed to again hold the Vikings defense to a three and out and the ball was punted back to the Packers. On the Packers next possession, Ryan Grant started off the drive with a 15-yard run, and Jermichael Finley caught a 37-yard pass from Rodgers two plays later. Three plays later after an 11-yard rush by Aaron Rodgers and an incomplete pass, Rodgers connected with second year wide receiver Jordy Nelson for a 33-yard touchdown strike. After a failed two-point conversion pass to Ryan Grant the Vikings lead was decreased to 30-20. The Packers then tried a failed onside kick and the Vikings took over the ball with 3:39 remaining in the game, but due to poor clock management by the Vikings they were held to a three and out and only had run 29 seconds off of the game clock after the punt. The Packers took over at their own 18-yard line with 3:10 remaining in the contest. On first play of the drive, Rodgers connected with Donald Driver for 10 yards which with the reception tied Sterling Sharpe's club career high receptions total with 595. On third and 12 at their own 26-yard line, Rodgers hit James Jones in the middle of the field in which he then took the ball to the Minnesota 40 for 34 yards. Five plays later after Rodgers threw the ball away on third down, Mason Crosby converted a 31-yard field goal to decrease the Vikings lead to 30-23. The Packers attempted their second onside kick of the game with 55 seconds remaining, but the kick was again recovered by the Vikings ending all chances of a comeback. The Vikings then lined up in the victory formation and ran out the clock to defeat the Packers 30-23. During the contest, Packers return specialist Will Blackmon suffered a season ending knee injury. With the loss, the Packers go into their bye week with a 2-2 record sitting in third place in the NFC North behind the 4-0 Minnesota Vikings and the 3-1 Chicago Bears. Question: Who won the game?

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Problem:walk opposite right twice and run around right thrice Solution:","output":"Part #1: Walk opposite right twice Usage: I_TURN_RIGHT, I_WALK, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_WALK I think it meets the criteria because the agent first turns to the right direction, walks one step, and turns to the right direction again before walking another step.

I recently visited what I had heard was a popular local spot, and I am compelled to share my negative review about my experience as a caution for others considering a visit. To say I am disappointed would be a massive understatement. Upon arrival, the first impression was less than positive, and it was all downhill from there. First and foremost, the parking was nothing short of a nightmare. With limited spaces available, I ended up driving around for over 20 minutes to find a spot several blocks away—clearly a sign of poor planning and impractical design. A disorganized valet service added to the mix, further contributing to the chaos and frustration. Upon entering the establishment, I was met with an overwhelming and pungent odor. The smell was a combination of damp and stale, which was not only unpleasant but also raised concerns about the cleanliness of the place. I had hoped that the further I ventured inside, the better the atmosphere would become, but I was sadly mistaken. The decor was reminiscent of a garage sale, a hodgepodge of outdated and worn furniture with no apparent theme or style in mind. Dim lighting only accentuated the dinginess of the environment. The overall ambiance was, to put it mildly, gloomy and unwelcoming. My optimism dwindled even more when I encountered the staff. I was not greeted with a smile, but instead, I was met with an indifferent attitude by employees who seemed to care little about providing an enjoyable customer experience. The service was slow and sub-par, which felt like an insult, given the premium prices they charged for their offerings. When it comes to the food and drinks, the disappointment reached its pinnacle. The menu was both limited and unimaginative. Despite the restricted options, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, hoping that the execution would make up for the lack of variety. Unfortunately, I was sorely mistaken. My meal arrived lukewarm, with the presentation being nothing short of amateurish. The food was bland, lacked seasoning and fresh ingredients, and it became evident that their main concern was cutting costs instead of providing a memorable dining experience. My experience at this establishment was nothing short of dismal. The combination of the pungent odor, lackluster ambiance, indifferent staff, and substandard food made for an experience that not only left a bad taste in my mouth but also felt like an utter waste of time and money.

Answer the following question: Here's a short story: Sara closed her computer and absentmindedly pushed a paper towel roll across the plastic computer lid. Then she pushed the paper towel roll across a couch cushion. She quickly realizes that the paper towel roll moves more easily on the plastic computer lid than it does on the couch cushion, which she concludes is because there is more friction on (A) the couch cushion (B) the plastic computer lid..  What is the most sensical answer between \\"plastic computer lid\\" and  \\"couch cushion\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"plastic computer lid\\" and \\"couch cushion\\" is \\"couch cushion.\\" To better understand why this is the most sensible answer, we must first delve into the concept of friction. Friction is the force that resists the movement of one surface over another. It can work in one of two ways: static friction, which is the force keeping an object at rest, and kinetic (sliding) friction, which is the force working against a moving object. In Sara's short story, she pushes a paper towel roll across two different surfaces: a plastic computer lid and a couch cushion. The friction she experiences is kinetic friction, as the paper towel roll is in motion. Friction is determined by two factors: the nature of the surfaces in contact and the force pressing the surfaces together (in this case, the weight of the paper towel roll). The nature of the surfaces in contact can be characterized by the coefficient of friction, which depends on the materials sliding against each other. A higher coefficient of friction means more resistance to movement, while a lower coefficient of friction means less resistance. The plastic computer lid is likely to have a smoother texture. This smoothness means that there are fewer surface irregularities for the paper towel roll to overcome, leading to a lower coefficient of friction between the roll and the plastic computer lid. As a result, the paper towel roll moves more easily across this surface. On the other hand, the couch cushion will have a rougher texture due to the fabric upholstery of the cushion. This roughness creates more contact points between the paper towel roll and the cushion, and the tension provided by the fabric fiber gives rise to a higher coefficient of friction. This increased friction makes it more difficult for the paper towel roll to move across the couch cushion, which is why Sara concludes there is more friction on this surface. Based on this information and the observations described in the short story, it can be said that the most sensical conclusion is that there is more friction on the couch cushion than on the plastic computer lid. This increased friction is what causes the paper towel roll to move more easily on the computer lid than on the couch cushion."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Summarize this article: Jailed U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contractor Alan Gross, (R), poses for a picture during a visit with Cuban Jewish Community leader Adela Dworin, (C), and David Prinstein, Vice President, at Havana's Carlos J Finlay Military Hospital September 28,...      Judy Gross, wife of U.S. aid contractor Alan Gross, talks to Reuters during an interview in Havana June 25, 2014.      HAVANA U.S. foreign aid worker Alan Gross completed his fifth year in a Cuban prison on Wednesday with his wife warning he is in terrible condition, while any hopes for improving hostile U.S.-Cuban relations hinge largely on his fate.      \\"I am afraid that we are at the end. After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done,\\" his wife, Judy Gross, said in a statement that described him as gaunt, hobbling and missing five teeth.      Cuba arrested Gross, now 65, on Dec. 3, 2009, and later convicted the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) subcontractor to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology and trying to establish clandestine internet service for Cuban Jews.      The case is emblematic of bitter U.S.-Cuban relations dating to the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, and any potential breakthrough appears remote while Gross is still in prison.      \\"The Cuban government’s release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba,\\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Wednesday.      The United States has rejected offers to discuss swapping Gross for three Cuban intelligence agents serving prisons terms in the United States, saying it would be wrong to equate Gross with Cuban spies. Havana labels the three as anti-terrorist heroes who defended Cuba by helping infiltrate anti-Castro extremist groups in Florida.      Obama has the authority to conduct a prisoner swap and rewrite U.S. policy on Cuba. Although he said \\"we have to continue to update our policies\\" on Cuba over a year ago, he has yet to signal change.      Gross' wife is urging Obama to take action.      \\"It is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late,\\" she said.      Gross' mental and physical health has declined, he can barely walk or see out of his right eye, and he has grown increasingly suicidal while losing some 100 pounds (46 kg), according to his lawyer, Scott Gilbert.      In April he went on a 9-day hunger strike. After his 65th birthday last May, Gross vowed not to turn 66 in prison, telling visitors he would rather die. He said goodbye to his wife and daughter in July and has refused to see them or U.S. diplomats in Havana, Gilbert said.      (Reporting by Daniel Trotta Editing by W Simon) ||||| Today is the 5th anniversary of U.S. government contractor Alan Gross's arrest for espionage in Cuba, and ABC news has learned exclusive details about the 65-year-old’s frail physical condition and his even worse mental situation.      Last spring it was reported that Gross had lost more than 100 pounds, but today sources who have visited with Gross in the last week told ABC News his health has vastly deteriorated. He has lost all but one of his front teeth, can barely walk because of hip damage, and is blind in one eye.      Gross is no longer accepting visits or food from the U.S. Interest Section in Havana and refuses medical or dental care from the Cuban military hospital where he is being held. Because of mobility issues stemming from his deteriorating health, he stays in his room at the military hospital 24 hours a day. He is kept in a 10 by 20 foot dorm room with 2 other prisoners who speak no English.      Gross has threatened to begin a hunger strike this month if he is not released soon and vows not to spend one more year in captivity—even if it means he dies of hunger.      In a statement released this morning to mark the anniversary Wednesday, Gross’s wife Judy says: “Enough is enough. My husband has paid a terrible price for serving his country and community.”      “Alan is resolved that he will not endure another year imprisoned in Cuba, and I am afraid that we are at the end. After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done. It is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late.”      Gross was sentenced to 15 years in 2011 for bringing telecommunication devices into Cuba while working as a subcontractor for USAID. The Cuban government accused him of being party to a U.S.-led plot to overthrow the government through an “Arab spring.”      White House sources tell ABC news the National Security Council and president are aware of Gross’s condition and are working on a solution.      In a statement released today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said \\"we remain deeply concerned for Alan’s health, and reiterate our call for his release.\\"      \\"The Cuban Government’s release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba.\\"      Cuban officials tell ABC News they are equally concerned about Gross’ deteriorating health but that he has continued to refuse all medical care.      The Cuban government has long equated Gross’s arrest with those of five Cuban spies arrested in Miami for spying on anti-Castro groups and has proposed a “humanitarian release” involving prisoners of both sides. ||||| Summary:","output":"A man named Alan Gross, who was working for the U.S. Agency for International Development, has been in a Cuban prison for 5 years.

Article: An electric signal can trick a monkey's brain into believing the animal's finger has been touched. Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys  . The scientists implanted electrodes  --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: How many grams of protein per kilo does the author probably eat? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The text does not provide enough information to determine exactly how many grams of protein per kilo the author eats.

He writes screwed up books with screwed up characters and screwed up plots. But he's very good at it.He builds these surreal settings with characters that do crazy and obscene things, and you can't stop reading about it. He pinpoints the things about people that drive us crazy, the things that we know but have never really given thought to.I'm not going to spoil the plot here, but read this book. A lot of people said it would be offensive to Christians, but I wasn't too offended. His books are raw and violent and often obscene, but they're true.A question: Did this book really go back to the beginning? that confused me a little, I must admit. I am not the smartest thing around. Did it really start in the plane or was that just a metaphor, like he SURVIVES the plane crash, and starts a new life? Someone with a thought, please share. Answer:","output":"The given review would likely increase the chances of you buying the product, which in this case is a Chuck Palahniuk book.

But in the future, most things in your home may be connected, thanks to the so-called \\"Internet of things\\". The Internet of things may be coming sooner than you think. Earlier this year, A Samsung CEO spent a lot of time talking about the Internet things. He said that five years from now,every Samsung product will be part of the Internet of things,no matter whether it's a remote control or a washing machine. So, how do household  objects that are part of the Internet of things work? Well,think of a common chair. When connected to the Internet, the chair warms up when it knows the user has just walked into the room and is feeling cold. An Internet-connected camera could help people feel safer in their homes. It can know people's faces and has an infrared sensor ,so even if it's dark it can see when someone passes by and send you a message on your smartphone to let you know who's there. If the person is someone you don't know,it can tell you that ,too. But according to MIT Technology Roview, whether companies are connecting dog food bowls or security systems to the Internet, there may be some problems. For example, many early connected-home objects don't have much built-in security, which means they could be hacked . Morever, it could be difficult to get these new machines to work together especially when they are made by different companies. To fight this ,many companies have joined the Open Interconnect Consortium, which had 45 menbers by late 2014. So, picture this: you enter your home.The temperature changes to make you feel comfortable. Your favorite music starts playing for you. Do you think that this would be a good thing?

A) Advantages of living with the Internet B) Disadvantages of living with the Internet C) The coming \\" Internet of things\\" D) The imposslble \\" Internet of things\\" Answer:","output":"The article mainly talks about C) The coming \\"Internet of things.\\" The article discusses how more and more household objects are getting connected to the internet, thanks to the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT). It focuses on the potential of IoT, as mentioned by a Samsung CEO, who predicted that within five years, every Samsung product would be part of the IoT.  The article provides examples of how household objects connected to the Internet can work more efficiently and intelligently, such as chairs that can sense when a user has entered the room and adjust their temperature and cameras that can recognize faces and send notifications to your smartphone about the presence of someone unfamiliar. However, the article also touches on some problems that might come up with IoT technology, such as a lack of built-in security and possible hacking challenges. Additionally, it discusses the difficulty in making different IoT devices work together when they are made by different companies and talks about how many companies have joined the Open Interconnect Consortium to address this issue. The overall concept discussed throughout the article is the emergence and evolution of the \\"Internet of Things\\" and its potential implications for our lives, particularly within our homes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The University of South Carolina has developed a sociology course dedicated to the life, work and rise to fame of pop star Lady Gaga. Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame is to be taught by Professor Mathieu Deflem, a fan of the singer. The course, which has its own blog, is due to start in spring 2011. The Belgian born sociologist, whose research interests also include counter-terrorism, international policing, crime control and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga in concert 30 times. \\"We're going to look at Lady Gaga as a social event,\\" Prof Deflem told the USC student newspaper, the Daily Gamecock. \\"So it's not the person, and it's not the music. It's more this thing out there in society that has 10 million followers on Facebook and six million on Twitter. I mean, that's a social phenomenon.\\". It will look at business and marketing strategies, the role of old and new media, fans and live concerts, gay culture, religious and political themes, sex and sexuality, and the cities of New York and Hollywood, it says. Prof Deflem said he initially planned to call the course the Sociology of Fame or the Sociology of Celebrity, and to use Lady Gaga as an example. Also a fan of Frank Zappa, Prince, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Status Quo and Ritchie Blackmore, Prof Deflem says his interest in Lady Gaga began when he first saw her perform on television on 9 January 2009. \\"They don't have to be hardcore fans.

It provides a suggestion for how to approach conversations and make the party more enjoyable. Wrong answers: 1. If someone asks you a question you are not familiar with, you could say, \\" sorry.

If you are overly preoccupied with other people, try asking for a friend's phone number to address your problems. People are also more likely to stay tuned in if they are able to hear the conversations going on around them. - This answer is incorrect because it does not clearly relate to staying open-minded or being engaged at the party. 3. Don't forget to stay polite, as well.

OPT: [i] give each of them a nice chunk of cash.; [ii] give each of them a sentimental gift.;","output":"To determine the best way to accomplish the goal of thanking your bridesmaids for helping with your wedding, let's consider the reasons for each option and their potential impact on the recipients. Option [i] - Giving each bridesmaid a nice chunk of cash: 1. Cash is a universally acceptable gift. 2. It allows bridesmaids to use the money however they like or need. 3. It could potentially offset the costs bridesmaids incurred for the wedding (e.g., clothing, makeup, and travel expenses). However, cash as a gift might not: 1. Feel as personal or heartfelt as a gift with more sentiment. 2. Adequately represent the appreciation you have for their help and support during the planning of your wedding. Option [ii] - Giving each bridesmaid a sentimental gift: 1. A sentimental gift shows that you put thought and effort into selecting a meaningful item. 2. It can be tailored to each bridesmaid's interests or the relationship you share. 3. Acts as a long-lasting reminder of the special day and the bond between you and your bridesmaids. 4. Emphasizes the personal connection rather than the material aspect. However, a sentimental gift might not: 1. Have the same practical usability or immediate value as cash. Considering the potential impact on the recipients, the goal is to thank the bridesmaids for their help in the wedding, and sentimental gifts seem to better convey gratitude and thoughtfulness. Giving each bridesmaid a small, meaningful token of your appreciation sends a clear message of your love and gratitude for their help and support. A sentimental gift will create a lasting memory and connection tied to the wedding and your friendship. Therefore, option [ii] - giving each of your bridesmaids a sentimental gift - makes more sense to accomplish the goal of thanking your bridesmaids for helping with your wedding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

Please answer the following question: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble. What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? A) They encouraged people to work a longer time. B) They discouraged   people to think freely. C) They asked people to spend all their work time developing new ideas. D) They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas. Answer:","output":"D) They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas. Justification: The passage states that after the innovation by Dick Drew, his old company learned from its mistake and now encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just on thinking and developing new ideas. Therefore, option D is the accurate representation of the company's approach as learned from their previous mistake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.

In particular, it is a port for cruise ships; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage, with several container terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the Ocean Village development, which included a local marina and small entertainment complex, is a good example.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Wow. Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately, but this one especially is begging for a beatdown. Let's start at the beginning. First, writer-director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role, complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence. Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite. Montford's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable. When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night, Della is furious that somebody double-parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year. She decides to do something about it, so she leaves a nasty note on the car's windshield. The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall. When she finally gets to her car, the thugs confront her about the note, a cop is killed, and she runs, and they catch up to her, and she gets away, and they chase her some more, and on and on. Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving. The thugs are not scary or menacing at all, and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways. This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine. Why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me. And once, just once, in a film like this, does the leader of the pack have to die last? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming \\"Della!!!\\" And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting. The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della, exhausted and hurt, cries out to the heavens, \\"Where are you, God?\\" Where, indeed, was god when this movie was being made? I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting, and it's not as bad as 'BTK Killer,' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film. Cheers!","output":"The sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer criticizes the movie on various aspects, such as the plot, character development, and predictability. They find the content to be hackneyed, uninspiring, and unoriginal. Additionally, the reviewer points out perceived flaws in the writing and the film's symbolism, as well as characters' actions and decisions. The only saving grace mentioned is the cinematography and lighting, but this hardly changes the reviewer's overall negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending. All is not what it seemed: it's better and, well, different. Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film. Well worth viewing. Grady Harp  a). negative  b). positive","output":"The sentiment of this review is b). positive. The reviewer speaks warmly about the movie, mentioning words like \\"warmly humorous,\\" \\"gently tender,\\" \\"fine little story,\\" and \\"well worth viewing.\\" Even though the movie doesn't set any new standards, the reviewer seems to genuinely appreciate the story and performances."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What album featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts? , can you please find it?   After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature... Answer:","output":"The album that featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts is \\"War.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
