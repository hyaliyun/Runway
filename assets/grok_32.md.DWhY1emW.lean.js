Question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

New York (CNN) -- The mayor of Newark has called for an investigation into a far-reaching New York Police Department surveillance program that was allegedly conducted in the New Jersey city's Muslim's neighborhoods. \\"The Newark Police Department was not involved in joint operations with the New York Police Department as was described in the disclosed NYPD report,\\" Mayor Cory Booker said Wednesday, referring to a leaked internal New York police document that allegedly detailed police surveillance of Muslim-owned business and mosques across the city. \\"I strongly believe that we must be vigilant in protecting our citizens from crime and terrorism but to put large segments of a religious community under surveillance with no legitimate cause or provocation clearly crosses a line,\\" he said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called the development \\"disturbing\\" and has asked the state's attorney general to investigate. The 60-page report, first obtained by The Associated Press, showed maps of Newark and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques. There was no statement in the document regarding terrorism or criminal activity. The New Jersey mayor's statement comes a day after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the extent of police surveillance against critics who have suggested authorities went too far. \\"We have to keep this country safe,\\" the mayor told reporters, addressing questions about a separate report, also leaked to AP, that indicated the New York police were closely monitoring Muslim student associations in schools across the Northeast. \\"If people put things on websites and make them available to everybody, of course the NYPD is going to look at anything that's publicly available in the public domain,\\" Bloomberg said. \\"And given we've had a dozen people arrested or convicted of terrorist acts who've come from similar organizations, we have an obligation to do so.\\" That report said police have tracked websites, and on one occasion sent an undercover officer with students from the City College of New York on a whitewater rafting trip. \\"The police department goes where there are allegations,\\" Bloomberg said. But Yale University President Richard Levin described New York's surveillance program as \\"antithetical to the values\\" of the New Haven, Connecticut, university and those of the nation. When a reporter asked if police had gone too far by sending the agent on the rafting trip, Bloomberg responded, \\"No.\\" Police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN that his agency does not monitor students directly but confirmed it monitors websites they use. \\"In any case where you see an NYPD officer present, it's an indication that we were looking at an individual,\\" he said. The Columbia University Muslim Students Association condemned the police practice in a statement this week. \\"We are concerned that news reports about NYPD's presence on our campus have a chilling effect on the intellectual freedom necessary for a vibrant academic community,\\" it read. In December, a prominent group of Muslim leaders boycotted Bloomberg's annual interfaith breakfast in protest of the controversial program. The move stemmed from a series of earlier news reports that raised questions about the nature of a CIA partnership with the New York police that allegedly helped to build city intelligence programs to spy on Muslims. The boycott stood in a stark contrast to the goodwill the mayor earned among Muslim leaders when he defended plans for a controversial Islamic community center near the former site of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The CIA later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency's partnership with New York police.","output":"Part #1: The maximum length of the highlight.

Options: -World -Sports -Business -Science/Tech","output":"This topic belongs to Science/Tech. The discovery of the last probable common ancestor's fossil between humans and great apes is a significant breakthrough in the field of human evolutionary studies. By analyzing these fossils, researchers can unlock crucial information about the biological and morphological traits that have shaped our lineage and led to the emergence of modern humans. The fossil, unearthed in Spain, demonstrates a unique blend of characteristics from both humans and apes, which may have allowed the species to adapt better during critical periods of evolutionary change. A body like an ape suggests that this species was adapted to moving through trees or across uneven surfaces. This physical feature would have benefited them in the arboreal environment, enabling them to effectively search for food, avoid predators, and establish a territory. In addition, fingers like a chimp indicate a greater degree of manual dexterity and gripping capabilities that could have been used in multiple ways - from handling objects and manipulating tools to signal communication and social functioning. This trait may have been vital in developing the cognitive and cultural processes that have enabled human intellectual development. One of the most striking features of human evolution is our upright posture, also known as bipedalism. This trait is shared with the last probable common ancestor, potentially providing evidence on how early hominids began to rely more on walking upright, ultimately leading to improved energy efficiency and the ability to traverse longer distances. Bipedalism also freed the hands for various tasks such as carrying objects, tool manufacturing, and social grooming - all essential factors to the social and cultural evolution of our species. This significant discovery highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in the field of paleoanthropology. By combining various investigative methods from disciplines such as geology, biology, and archeology, researchers can reveal fascinating stories about our past and understand the complex factors that lead to the evolutionary success of our species. In conclusion, the topic of the last probable common ancestor to humans and great apes found in Spain is most accurately classified under the Science/Tech category. This discovery contributes to our understanding of human evolution, illustrating the morphological features and biological traits that have set the stage for the emergence of modern humans. It sheds light on the evolutionary adaptations that propelled our ancestors towards the sophisticated cognitive and social abilities that define humanity today."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was one of Henry V's victories?  When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \\"the Kingmaker\\")...

The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941.  Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose relationship with their wife becomes strained?, using the article: John, an ambitious young police officer, is sent undercover to join a violent football firm associated with the fictitious club Shadwell Town to track down the 'generals' - the shadowy figures who orchestrate the violence. His team of four gradually ingratiate themselves into the lives of The Dogs, the nickname that Shadwell's fans give themselves.  The main site for this is The Rock, a public house around which The Dogs' lives revolve.  Gradually, the hard drinking and hard fighting macho culture - where Saturday's match and Saturday's fight are all that matters - prove strangely irresistible to John and he slowly finds himself becoming one of the thugs he has been sent to entrap. His relationships with his wife, his superiors and even his team become strained. Eventually his wife returns to her parents' house and rebuffs his attempted reconciliation. The police operation is abruptly wound up for budgeting reasons, just as it seems John is making progress in identifying those who pull the strings. The closing sequence shows a shaven-headed John taking part in a racist march, having become nothing more than a neo-nazi fascist.  One of his team approaches him to try to help him, but is rebuffed. John says that he is, again, working undercover.  There is a degree of ambiguity, and it might be that he is working undercover, though it may also be that he has become deluded and has merely mired himself in an even less pleasant world.

Q:Given the below context:  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Uranium enrichment is a process that's critical for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. This dual-use technology is thus rigorously monitored and regulated on an international level. In this context, the enrichment of uranium by Iran, a country that has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), becomes a significant point of concern for many nations worldwide because it potentially signals Tehran’s capability and intention to develop nuclear weapons. The passage also highlights the diplomatic efforts of three European powers to curb Iran's nuclear program. Although these countries are not explicitly named in the excerpt, historical knowledge reveals the group typically referenced in such cases is the E3, or EU3, consisting of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. These key European nations have repeatedly aimed to negotiate with Iran in order to persuade the country to halt its nuclear developments and particularly its uranium enrichment activities as part of a broader strategy to maintain stability in the Middle East and global nuclear security. Lastly, the threat to \\"intensify pressure\\" on Iran if it does not comply with requests to curb its nuclear program suggests a range of diplomatic and economic measures, including potential sanctions or reporting the issue to international institutions such as the United Nations.

This statement emphasizes the importance of having a long-term strategic vision when implementing a current strategy. In any organization or project, having a clear and well-defined strategy allows for better planning and decision-making processes. It ensures that all the steps taken are aligned with the ultimate goals and objectives of the organization. When a strategy is based on a long-term vision, it means that the organization is considering not only its immediate needs and goals but also the future prospects. This long-term perspective allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex factors that can affect the success of the strategy. These factors can include economic trends, technological advancements, and changes in the industry landscape. Furthermore, this statement highlights the importance of quantifying the results of a long-term strategy. Quantifying the results means measuring and evaluating the outcomes of the strategic actions taken by the organization. This may involve collecting data, establishing key performance indicators (KPIs), or even conducting cost-benefit analyses to determine the return on investments made in pursuing the strategy. Quantifying the results of the long-term strategic vision enables the organization to assess the success of the current strategy, learn from its past experiences, and make necessary adjustments to improve future outcomes. It also helps the organization communicate its progress and achievements to stakeholders, such as investors or shareholders, who may have a specific interest in the long-term prospects of the organization.

Information:  - Dionysius of Halicarnassus (\\"Dionysos Alexandrou Alikarnasseus\\"; \\"\\"Dionysios son of Alexandros of Halikarnassos\\"\\"; c. 60 BCafter 7 BC) was a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, who flourished during the reign of Caesar Augustus. His literary style was Atticistic  imitating Classical Attic Greek in its prime.  - Paolo Caliari, known as Paolo Veronese (15281588), was an Italian Renaissance painter, based in Venice, known for large-format history paintings of religion and mythology, such as \\"The Wedding at Cana\\"(1563) and \\"The Feast in the House of Levi\\" (1573). Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the \\"cinquecento\\" and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian.  - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - Lucretia is a painting by Paolo Veronese from c. 1585 .  - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490  27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth.  - Tintoretto (born Jacopo Comin, late September or early October, 1518  May 31, 1594) was an Italian painter and a notable exponent of the Renaissance school. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso. His work is characterized by its muscular figures, dramatic gestures, and bold use of perspective in the Mannerist style, while maintaining color and light typical of the Venetian School.  - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century.  - Titus Livius (64 or 59 BCAD 17)known as Livy in Englishwas a Roman historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people  \\"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\\" (\\"Books from the Foundation of the City\\")  covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own time. He was on familiar terms with the Julio-Claudian dynasty, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history. Livy and Augustus's wife, Livia, were from the same clan in different locations, although not related by blood.  - The Feast in the House of Levi or Christ in the House of Levi is a 1573 painting by Italian painter Paolo Veronese and one of the largest canvases of the 16th century, measuring .

History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait. The term is derived from the wider senses of the word \\"historia\\" in Latin and Italian, meaning \\"story\\" or \\"narrative\\", and essentially means \\"story painting\\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850. In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings.   - Lucretia or Lucrece (died ) was an ancient Roman woman whose fate played a vital role in the transition of Roman government from the Roman Kingdom to the Roman Republic. While there were no contemporary sources, accounts from Roman historian Livy (Livius) and Greek-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus from the time of Emperor Caesar Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) agreed that there was such a woman and that her suicide after being raped by an Etruscan king's son was the immediate cause of the anti-monarchist rebellion that overthrew the monarchy.    What is the relationship between 'lucretia ' and '1580'?","output":"The relationship between 'Lucretia' and '1580' is that 'Lucretia' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter, Paolo Veronese, created around 1585.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? from the following article ?  St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs. Answer:","output":"The right claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century was the right to present the rector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Why might it be easier for us to repeat tasks using a computer?\\" in the given passage can be summarized as the concept of the \\"flow of control\\" within a program. Flow of control allows a computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention, which makes it easier for us to repeat tasks using a computer. The passage compares program execution to reading a book, in which a person reads each word and line, sometimes jumping back to an earlier place or skipping sections. In a similar fashion, a computer can go back and repeat instructions in a program multiple times based on internal conditions being met.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"Based on the information provided in this paragraph, one could ask: \\"What is the Iranian government's motivation for targeting and imprisoning women's rights activists, and how does this impact the regime's internal legitimacy?\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A man in spandex maneuvers his bike over an obstacle.\\", can we conclude \\"a man is riding his bike\\"?","output":"In the given statement, \\"A man in spandex maneuvers his bike over an obstacle,\\" the man is described as actively controlling his bike to navigate and surpass an obstacle. Although the statement does not explicitly say that the man is riding the bike, we can deduce that the man is indeed riding the bike based on certain clues. To analyze the situation, let's break down the statement into smaller elements: 1. \\"A man in spandex\\": This phrase establishes that there is a person involved who is wearing spandex, a stretchy fabric commonly used in tight-fitting athletic wear. It suggests that the man might be engaged in some physical activity or sport. 2.  \\"maneuvers\\": The verb \\"maneuver\\" means to skillfully guide or navigate something through a complex or intricate situation. In this context, it implies the man is actively and precisely controlling the bike to achieve a specific outcome. 3. \\"his bike\\": This part of the statement indicates that the man possesses and is using a bike. The implication of possession suggests that the man is using the bike for its intended purpose or functionality. 4. \\"over an obstacle\\": This phrase indicates that there is some challenge or barrier that the man is working to overcome using the bike. It further strengthens the notion that the man is engaged in some physical activity or sport, as overcoming obstacles is often a component of various athletic disciplines. Taking these elements together, we can infer that the man is indeed riding the bike. The presence of the obstacle provides context that the man is actively engaged in navigating his bike and overcoming challenges. The use of the term \\"maneuver\\" further supports the idea that the man is in control of the bike as he navigates it through a potentially intricate or difficult situation. Moreover, wearing spandex implies that the man is dressed for a physically demanding activity, which also corroborates the conclusion that the man is riding his bike. In conclusion, based on the context and indirect clues provided in the statement, we can reasonably deduce that \\"a man is riding his bike\\" when \\"A man in spandex maneuvers his bike over an obstacle.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The canonical Easter tables were devised at the end of the third century, when the vernal equinox fell either on 20 March or 21 March depending on the year's position in the leap year cycle.

Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road. Mail truck. Must be time for breakfast. About time I ate something. Question: Why was Justin's face like leather? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"Justin's face was described as being like leather, most likely due to the prolonged exposure to the harsh elements, such as the sun, wind, and dry air that he faced as a result of working outdoors for extended periods. Over time, constant exposure to these elements can cause the skin to become dry, tough, and wrinkled, taking on the appearance of leather. Justin's occupation as a rancher or farmer would have required him to spend long hours outside in all types of weather, tending to the land and his cattle. This lifestyle, combined with his aging, would contribute to the leathery and weathered appearance of his face.  Additionally, the passage indicates that Justin has had a long life, with references to his \\"aging back,\\" making it likely that the passage of time has played a role in the leather-like appearance of his face. The line about \\"hating it more than usual\\" implies that he is becoming more aware of the physical effects of his age and perhaps even experiencing a degree of self-consciousness about them. Furthermore, Justin's stubbornness and refusal to admit that his constant thinking has slowed his progress on the cattle pen suggest that he may not take proper breaks or care for himself while working, which could also contribute to the weathered appearance of his skin. This is supported by the fact that he reminds himself to buy some cattle, indicating that he is preoccupied with his work and overlooks self-care, such as seeking shade and drinking water. In summary, the leather-like appearance of Justin's face is the result of years of hard work outdoors, his aging, and perhaps a tendency to neglect self-care due to a strong work ethic and stubbornness, which have caused his skin to become weathered and tough, resembling leather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The group stands accused of committing heinous war crimes during the Sierra Leone Civil War, a brutal conflict that took place between 1991 and 2002. Step 1: Introduction to the context The trial pertains to the Civil War in Sierra Leone, a conflict that left tens of thousands of people dead and millions displaced. Various factions fought for control over the territory and its valuable resources, leading to a multitude of atrocities and human rights abuses. Step 2: Present the accused group The pro-government militia in the trial is accused of perpetrating numerous war crimes during the conflict. They played a significant role in the unrest and the escalation of violence, contributing to the devastation faced by civilians caught in the crossfire. Step 3: Describe the court's decision Following a series of delays and setbacks during the pretrial phase, the Sierra Leone War Crimes Court has made the decision to adjourn the trial. This move grants both the prosecution and defense teams additional time to gather evidence and build their respective cases. Step 4: Discuss potential outcomes As the trial remains adjourned, it is yet unclear when it will resume. Nevertheless, this case holds significant potential for setting a precedent in addressing war crimes committed during times of conflict. If found guilty, the accused militia members could face severe consequences, serving as a deterrent to future acts of violence and human rights abuses. Step 5: Highlight the importance of the trial The trial of the pro-government militia in Sierra Leone serves as a crucial step toward achieving justice for the victims of the Civil War and the country's efforts to establish a lasting peace. It serves as a reminder of the importance of holding perpetrators accountable for their actions and upholding human rights protections. In conclusion, the adjournment of the Sierra Leone War Crimes trial signifies the ongoing complexities surrounding the process of seeking justice for war crimes committed during the Civil War. While this development does not signal the end of the case, it highlights the continued need for thorough and transparent investigations to ensure that those responsible for atrocities are held accountable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They have evidence that an unknown flying craft crashed in their vicinity, so Reporter Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer) tags along for the story. Dr. Carrington later briefs Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen, and Dr. Redding (George Fenneman) shows photos of a flying object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a meteorite. Following erratic magnetic pole anomalies, the crew and scientists fly to the crash site aboard the team's C-47. The mysterious craft lies buried beneath refrozen ice, with just the tip of a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface. As they outline the craft's general shape, they realize they are standing in a circle: they have discovered a crashed flying saucer. They try deicing the buried craft with thermite heat bombs, but only ignite its metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Their Geiger counter then points to a slightly radioactive frozen shape buried nearby in the refrozen ice. They excavate a large block of ice around what appears to be a tall body and fly it to the research outpost, just as a major storm moves in, cutting off their communications with Anchorage. Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives further instructions from the Air Force. Later, Corporal Barnes (William Self) takes the second watch over the ice block and to avoid looking at the body within, covers it with an electric blanket that the previous guard left turned on. As the ice slowly melts, the Thing inside revives; Barnes panics and begins shooting at it with his .45 caliber sidearm, but the alien escapes into the sub-zero cold of the raging storm.

Plot title: Return of the Living Dead Movie plot: At a medical supply warehouse in Louisville, a foreman named Frank tries to impress the company's newest employee Freddy by showing him military drums that accidentally wound up in the basement of the building; the drum contains the remains of an military experiment gone wrong that inspired the film Night of the Living Dead. Frank accidentally unleashes the toxic gas, which renders the two unconscious. When waking up, Frank and Freddy find that the gas reanimated a cadaver inside a meat locker, and contacts their boss and warehouse owner Burt Wilson to help them deal with the situation. When decapitation cannot kill the cadaver, Burt decides to bring the corpse to the nearby mortuary to have its dismembered parts burned in a gambit to destroy it once and for all. Meanwhile, Freddy's friends learn of his new job from his girlfriend Tina. The group, consisting of Spider, Trash, Scuz, Suicide, Casey, and Chuck, decide to pick Freddy up after he finishes his shift and wait inside the local cemetery. Tina leaves the graveyard and enters the warehouse to look for Freddy. Her search leads her to the basement, where she unwittingly draws attention from the half-melted corpse from the drum barrel (dubbed \\"Tarman\\") who was initially thought to have dissolved. She locks herself inside a metal closet after a failed attempt to run, but the zombie finds a chained hook and tries to pull the door off. At the mortuary, Burt gets the mortician Ernie to burn the remains, not realizing that it causes the gas to contaminate the air and bringing a toxic rainfall to resurrect the dead in the graveyard. The acid rain forces Freddy's friends to refuge inside the warehouse. Once inside, the group hears the basement commotion and immediately rush down to rescue Tina, but Suicide is bitten by Tarman in the process. This forces the group, including Tina, to abandon Suicide and barricade the door to stop Tarman from coming up.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process in maintaining blood sugar levels involves the detection and monitoring of blood sugar levels by specialized cells. This is an essential aspect to ensure the body can sustain its vital functions as it requires an adequate supply of energy. Let's break down the detailed process below: 1. Detection of blood sugar levels: The body constantly monitors the blood sugar (glucose) levels as a key aspect of maintaining its overall homeostasis. In the pancreas, there are specific cells, called alpha cells, that are primarily responsible for detecting changes in blood glucose concentrations. 2. Release of glucagon: When the blood sugar levels drop below a specific threshold, the alpha cells in the pancreas initiate the process by releasing a hormone called glucagon. Glucagon acts as a signal to the liver and other body cells to elevate blood glucose levels. 3. Conversion of glycogen to glucose: The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels by storing glucose in the form of glycogen. In response to the glucagon signal, the liver starts converting the stored glycogen back into glucose through a process called glycogenolysis. 4. Release of glucose into the blood: Once the glycogen has been converted back into glucose, it is released into the bloodstream. This glucose is then distributed to various organs and tissues, where it can be utilized as a source of energy. 5. Restoring blood sugar levels: As the blood glucose levels rise due to the newly released glucose, the body can maintain its normal functions, avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Once the blood sugar concentrations return to the normal range, the secretion of glucagon by the pancreas decreases, preventing an excessive rise in glucose levels. 6. Feedback and regulation: The entire process of blood glucose maintenance is tightly regulated by a feedback mechanism that involves the cells in the pancreas, liver, and other tissues. This ongoing communication ensures that blood glucose levels remain stable and within a healthy range for the body to function optimally. In conclusion, the first step of the process in maintaining blood sugar levels is the detection of blood glucose concentrations by the alpha cells in the pancreas. This step is vital as it initiates the subsequent mechanisms such as the release of glucagon and the conversion of glycogen into glucose to restore sufficient blood sugar levels and ensure the body's proper functioning."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Bad Review: \\"Survivor\\" has the smell of a delicious meal - its bold, frenzied opening carries the aroma of good meat cooking. But Palahniuk is a short order cook serving up thin, insufficient burgers whose only flavoring is a slathering of ketchup. You can salt bad food to save it, but that doesn't make it worth swallowing.This is less an act of literature than a smart-alecky rant. A rant that is neither new nor funny nor intriguing. It is insufferably trite - to the point of being numbing - and coarsely, cheaply repetitive. We're a culture hung up on looks, on money, on fame, on competition, on faith - repulsively so, farcically so. Yeah, so what? That is the ear-splitting sermon of this tiresome book. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of the given product review is decidedly negative. The reviewer uses various criticisms and harsh descriptions to convey their dissatisfaction with the book \\"Survivor\\" by Chuck Palahniuk. From the very beginning, the title, \\"Bad Review,\\" sets a negative tone that is followed throughout the entire piece. The reviewer then employs multiple metaphors and comparisons to highlight their dissatisfaction with the quality of the writing. In particular, the analogy of the meal suggests that there was promise in the premise of the book, likening its bold opening to the smell of good meat cooking. However, the reviewer ultimately concludes that the author failed to deliver on this potential, comparing the book's content to a greasy, thin burger slathered in ketchup. The reviewer goes on to describe the book as \\"insufferably trite\\" and \\"numbing,\\" harsh adjectives which drive home the negative tone. The reviewer is especially critical of the book's reiteration of common cultural critiques, referring to it as a \\"smart-alecky rant\\" that berates the readers without offering any new or compelling insights. It is clear that the reviewer finds the book painfully repetitive, further emphasizing the negativity of their opinion. Lastly, the mention of the \\"ear-splitting sermon\\" in the book showcases the annoyance and disappointment the reviewer feels about the content and delivery. The use of strong language, such as \\"repulsive\\" and \\"farcical,\\" only adds to the overall negative tone of the review. In summary, the product review's tone is unmistakably negative, with the reviewer harshly critiquing both the style and content of \\"Survivor\\" by Chuck Palahniuk. The use of various metaphors, comparisons, and strong language to describe their dissatisfaction further emphasizes the negative opinion of the book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.  Over several millennia, however, the global system of garbage patches will accumulate in the North Pacific.In 2016 six new animal...  Two of Earth's oceans provide vast quantities of fish for human consumption. The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life.  Which ocean accounts for a more economically valuable tuna catch? A:","output":"The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. This is primarily due to the presence of a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms during summer, as a result of strong monsoon winds and upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis. Phytoplankton production supports the marine ecosystem and forms the base of the marine food web, and eventually helps in sustaining larger fish species such as tuna. While the Pacific Ocean has less phytoplankton and available nutrients for marine life, it still provides a significant amount of fish for human consumption. However, in terms of economic value for tuna catch, the Indian Ocean has a higher value due to the factors mentioned above. It is essential to note that the Indian Ocean borders many countries that highly depend on the fishing industry for domestic consumption and export, as well as foreign fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan that exploit the region mainly for shrimp and tuna."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the socialist trade unions all those leading elements which to any degree represented the independence of the trade union movement were pushed out. Please remove spaces between words.","output":"Inthesocialisttradeunionsallthoseleadingelementswhichtoanydegreerepresentedtheindependenceofthetradeunionmovementwerepushedout. To elaborate on the initial statement, under a socialist regime, trade unions often experience a suppression or elimination of their independence. This is because these political systems emphasize centralized control and decision-making, which can be at odds with the decentralized and autonomous nature of labor unions. In a socialist society, the government plays a significant role in the management and regulation of the economy. This means that the state may also exert considerable influence over trade unions, aiming to ensure that they align with official policies and goals. The government's intervention in labor relations can be achieved through various means, such as legal and institutional mechanisms, participation in the administration of trade unions, or controlling the selection and appointment of union leaders. As a result, independence and autonomy may be compromised within socialist trade unions. The leading elements within these organizations, which advocate for and embody the democratic and self-governing nature of the labor movement, may find themselves sidelined or removed from positions of power. This can manifest in several ways: 1. Purging and replacing independent-minded leaders: Socialist governments might systematically expel those individuals who are seen as challenging or opposing the state's authority and replace them with party loyalists or ideologues. 2. Restricting or abolishing democratic practices: The government can impose structural changes within trade unions that undermine the democratic processes essential to their functioning, such as regular elections, open debates, and member participation in decision-making. 3. Merging or dismantling unions: In order to exert greater control over the labor movement, the state might decide to merge smaller, autonomous unions into larger, more centralized bodies. This can lead to the dissolution of independent unions and the subsequent subsuming of their members and interests under the guise of larger, state-controlled organizations. 4. Suppressing dissent and opposition: The government may resort to more forceful tactics, such as intimidation, surveillance, or outright repression against labor activists and organizers who challenge the state's control over the trade union movement. 5. Limiting the scope and influence of trade unions: By restricting the legal and political powers of trade unions, a socialist government can effectively limit their ability to engage in collective bargaining, organize strikes, or pursue other forms of labor activism. Despite these obstacles, socialist trade unions can still potentially play significant roles in the struggle for workers' rights and social justice. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that under such systems, the independence and autonomy of trade unions may be at risk, and considerable efforts must be made to safeguard and nurture the democratic and emancipatory potential of the labor movement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ventura was born James George Janos on July 15, 1951 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of George William Janos and his wife, Bernice Martha (nee Lenz). Both of his parents were World War II veterans. Ventura has an older brother who served in the Vietnam War. Ventura has described himself as Slovak, since his father's parents were from what is now Slovakia; his mother was of German descent. After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.  In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \\"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\\" The petition was denied. The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, a proposed petition for recall is required to be reviewed by the Chief Justice for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied, on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.  In November 2011, Ventura held a press conference in relation to a lawsuit he had filed against the Transportation Security Administration. During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would \\"never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the '68 Olympics, Jesse Ventura will do that today.\\"  During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as \\"media jackals,\\" a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about the event, spoofing Ventura as \\"Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,\\" a self-aggrandizing former \\"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor \\"makes Minnesota proud\\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, in which he responded controversially to the following question: \\"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\\". Ventura responded, \\"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\\". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.","output":"This text is about James George Janos, better known as Jesse Ventura.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Sir John Alexander Macdonald (11 January 1815  6 June 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada (18671873, 18781891). The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones.  - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980.  - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919  September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984. He is the 3rd longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days.  - The Conservative Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Tories, is a political party in Canada. It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum. The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was Stephen Harper, who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015.  - The Liberal Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum. The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP).  - The Canadian federal election of 1979 was held on May 22 , 1979 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 31st Parliament of Canada . It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 11 years in power under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power , but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons . The Liberals , however , did beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes .  - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874  July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state.  - The New Democratic Party (NDP NPD) is a social-democratic political party in Canada. The leader of the federal wing of the NDP is Thomas Mulcair, who was elected in the 2012 leadership election, led the party through the 2015 federal election and then lost a party leadership review on April 10, 2016. Mulcair will remain as leader, until his replacement is chosen at a leadership election to be held in 2017.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'office contested' with the subject 'canadian federal election'.  Choices: - leadership  - prime minister  - prime minister of canada A:","output":"The object entity that exhibits the relation 'office contested' with the subject 'Canadian federal election' from the given choices is 'Prime Minister of Canada'.  The Canadian federal elections are primarily intended to elect members for the Canadian House of Commons, which subsequently leads to the selection of the Prime Minister. According to the Westminster system, the leader of the political party which has the majority in the House of Commons is asked by the Governor General to become the Prime Minister. The Prime Ministership is the principal goal for the leaders of the political parties contesting in the election. For instance, Sir John Alexander Macdonald, Joe Clark, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and William Lyon Mackenzie King have all served as the Prime Minister of Canada at different periods, and they began their journey to that post by leading their respective parties in federal elections.

Mickey Charles Mantle (October 20, 1931 - August 13, 1995), nicknamed The Commerce Comet and The Mick, was an American professional baseball player. Mantle played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the New York Yankees as a center fielder and first baseman, from 1951 through 1968. Mantle was one of the best players and sluggers, and is regarded by many as the greatest switch hitter in baseball history. Mantle was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Mantle was invited to the Yankees instructional camp before the 1951 season. After an impressive spring training, Yankees manager Casey Stengel decided to promote Mantle to the majors as a right fielder instead of sending him to the minors. Mickey Mantle's salary for the 1951 season was 7,500.  Mantle was assigned uniform #6, signifying the expectation that he would become the next Yankees star, following Babe Ruth (#3), Lou Gehrig (#4) and Joe DiMaggio (#5). Stengel, speaking to SPORT, stated \\"He's got more natural power from both sides than anybody I ever saw.\\" Bill Dickey called Mantle \\"the greatest prospect [he's] seen in [his] time.\\"  After a brief slump, Mantle was sent down to the Yankees' top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. However, he was not able to find the power he once had in the lower minors. Out of frustration, he called his father one day and told him, \\"I don't think I can play baseball anymore.\\" Mutt drove up to Kansas City that day. When he arrived, he started packing his son's clothes and, according to Mantle's memory, said \\"I thought I raised a man. I see I raised a coward instead. You can come back to Oklahoma and work the mines with me.\\" Mantle immediately broke out of his slump, going on to hit .361 with 11 homers and 50 RBIs during his stay in Kansas City.  Mantle was called up to the Yankees after 40 games with Kansas City, this time wearing uniform #7. He hit .267 with 13 home runs and 65 RBI in 96 games. In the second game of the 1951 World Series, New York Giants rookie Willie Mays hit a fly ball to right-center field.

In getting out of DiMaggio's way, Mantle tripped over an exposed drain pipe and severely injured his right knee.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.  - Brigham Young University (often referred to as BYU or, colloquially, The Y) is a private research university in Provo, Utah, United States. It is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and excluding online students, is the largest of any religious university and the third largest private university in the United States, with 29,672 on-campus students. Approximately 99 percent of the students are members of the LDS Church, and one-third of its US students are from Utah.  - Psychology of religion consists of the application of psychological methods and interpretive frameworks to religious traditions, as well as to both religious and irreligious individuals. It attempts to accurately describe the details, origins, and uses of religious beliefs and behaviors. Although the psychology of religion first arose as a self-conscious discipline as recently as the late 19th century, all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.  - Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.  - Theology is the critical study of the nature of the divine. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities, seminaries and schools of divinity.  - A religious experience (sometimes known as a spiritual experience, sacred experience, or mystical experience) is a subjective experience which is interpreted within a religious framework. The concept originated in the 19th century, as a defense against the growing rationalism of Western society. William James popularised the concept.  - An academic or scholarly journal is a periodical publication in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published. Academic journals serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny and discussion of research. They are usually peer-reviewed or refereed. Content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, and book reviews. The purpose of an academic journal, according to the first editor of the world's oldest academic journal Henry Oldenburg, is to give researchers a venue to \\"impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design of improving natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts, and Sciences.\\"  - The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (\\"J Sci Study Relig\\", also sometimes abbreviated as \\"JSSR\\") is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal published by Wiley-Blackwell in the United States of America under the auspices of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, dedicated to publishing scholarly articles in the social sciences, including psychology, sociology and anthropology, devoted to the study of religion. It is not a theology journal, as its publications tend to be empirical papers in the aforementioned disciplines, rather than papers assessing the truth or falsity, or otherwise attempting to clarify, theological doctrines. However, the eminent theologian Paul Tillich wrote a preface to the first edition, published in 1961. A former editor, Ralph W. Hood, is a major name in the psychology of religion, having published scales to assess religious experience and mystical experience. Hood was succeeded as editor in 1999 by Ted Jelen, the first ever political scientist to edit the journal. Jelen was later succeeded as editor by sociologist Rhys Williams. The current editor of the journal is Laura Olson (Clemson University).  - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS Church or, informally, the Mormon Church) is a Christian restorationist church that is considered by its followers to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 74,000 missionaries and a membership of over 15 million. It is ranked by the National Council of Churches as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening.  - The term social order can be used in two senses. In the first sense, it refers to a particular set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all.  - Psychology is the study of behavior and mind, embracing all aspects of conscious and unconscious experience as well as thought. It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range...  - The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (founded in 1949) was formed to advance research in the social scientific perspective on religious institutions and experiences.  - Sociology is the study of social behaviour or society, including its origins, development, organization, networks, and institutions. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.  - Welfare is the provision of a minimal level of well-being and social support for citizens without current means to support basic needs. In most developed countries, welfare is largely provided by the government from tax income, and to a lesser extent by charities, informal social groups, religious groups, and inter-governmental organizations.  - Brigham Young (June 1, 1801August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and a settler of the Western United States. He was the second President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. He founded Salt Lake City and he served as the first governor of the Utah Territory. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the University of Utah and Brigham Young University.  - Marie Cornwall ( born 1949 ) is the editor of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion , a professor of sociology and women 's studies at Brigham Young University ( BYU ) and a former director of BYU 's Women 's Research Institute .  - Paul Johannes Tillich (August 20, 1886  October 22, 1965) was a German American Christian existentialist philosopher and  theologian who is widely regarded as one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century.  - Clemson University is an American public, coeducational, land-grant and sea-grant research university in Clemson, South Carolina.

Bravo to the modern Asian noodle and dumpling house. The noodles soups are top notch, especially the Hot Pot seafood soup, as well as the simply delicious in a bowl, Roasted Pork noodle soup with ramen. I'm still thinking about it until now, although I could do without the mushrooms (and I like mushrooms). My friend and I, shared two starters, the Smoked \\"Pig Face\\" dumplings and the Peking Duck bun. The dumplings were scrumptious because of the pork, yum but i'm not sure if the price is justified at 8 for 4 pieces, it's pretty much the size of a gyoza dumpling, so, it's not large but taste factor it's on point. As for the Peking duck bun that can be split between two but one bun per person will suffice because it's plenty and delicious, I'm looking forward to trying out their other buns in the near future. My friend got the chicken katsu, and she said it was pretty good but advised that in the future, she'd get the sauce on the side because it was quite salty. Overall, love the resto layout, the overall feel is cozy but for some odd reason there seems to be a draft. Service was not slow but there seem to be confusion with some orders, I'm thinking it's first official day jitters, and eventually i'm sure, service will smoothen out.

Bernard Chanticleer, called \\"Big Boy\\" by his parents, is 19 but still lives with his overbearing, clinging mother and his commanding, disapproving father, who is Curator of Incunabula at the New York Public Library. Bernard also works as a low-level assistant at the library, where his father is constantly monitoring and admonishing him. His father decides it's time he grew up and moved out of the family home in Great Neck and into his own Manhattan apartment. His mother is not happy about letting him go, but acquiesces to her husband and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing.  Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room.

It had a sort of, um, hesitant, diluted air, like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire. So we were left with weak mix of the three. The actors seemed kinda lost. Also, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombified themselves. How many more times do we have to be told the 50's in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat. Its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was. I know it was a comedy and all, but - especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period - you still need some sort of emotional anchor, some relatable guide through the story, to make it engaging. For the 'hero' kid to watch an old woman, two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders, then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way. The mum was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level, then you risk losing me and that's what happened. Biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough, it was a handsome film, especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the Robinsons' house. Also, the opening newsreel was cute, in a been-done-before-but-still-funny sort of way. And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and that comes from someone who isn't a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene, but he played it pretty low-key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film. All in all, not great though.","output":"The person who wrote this review thinks the movie they're talking about wasn't very good. They didn't hate it, but they won't remember it.

Why does the narrator express anger at some Americans despite being American ?","output":"The narrator in the text expresses frustration or anger towards some Americans despite being American likely due to their perceived pretentious and presumptuous behavior towards Japan and Japanese culture. The narrator seems to be conscious of their own status as an American, potentially understanding the inherent cultural biases and stereotypes that often tend to form people's opinions on other cultures. By stating that they cannot stand Americans who \\"pretend to know everything about Japan and Japanese people/culture,\\" the narrator highlights their irritation with those who act in a superior or self-important manner without sufficient experience or knowledge about Japan. In this context, the narrator also makes an effort to distance themselves from this group of pretentious Americans, implying that they have some level of genuine experience with Japanese culture. This self-awareness allows them to maintain a level of authenticity and credibility in their own encounters in Japan, as opposed to assuming a know-it-all attitude that can irritate locals and fellow Americans alike. In addition, the narrator mentions their enjoyment of previous visits to Japanese schools, further emphasizing their sincere interest and experience in Japanese culture. It is important to note that the narrator does not dismiss or express anger towards all Americans – just those who exhibit a particularly arrogant or misguided understanding of Japan. Overall, the narrator's frustration stems from witnessing or experiencing the consequences of cultural ignorance or pretentiousness that some Americans display towards Japan. As someone who seems to appreciate the value of authentic engagement and cultural understanding, the narrator is likely irritated by those who undermine the genuine and meaningful experiences that others, like themselves, strive to foster."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer \\"a\\" is incorrect because using a peeler to pick up mulch is unrelated to the camera and computer setup described in the question.

What was the best excuse that a student ever gave for having failed to do something? I would have to say that I was most entertained by a student’s response to “Why are you late for school?” The student said, “I awoke in time this morning but there was a mouse sitting on the edge of my bed. I looked at him and he looked back. The mouse said to me, ‘Go back to sleep’ and what could I do? He had a gun.” The following has worked a few times too when students refuse to talk. That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other. Then when they are assembled before me again, I say, “Thank you gentlemen. I know who did it so you others are free to return to class.” All but one arises and leaves. This works more times than not.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What three genres influence Viking metal?  The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly... Answer:","output":"Viking metal is influenced by three primary genres: black metal, folk metal, and death metal. Black metal serves as the foundation for the harsh and aggressive sound that characterizes Viking metal, with its fast tempos, shrieking vocals, and chaotic instrumentals. Folk metal contributes the incorporation of traditional Nordic instruments and melodies, adding a distinct cultural element to the music. Finally, death metal plays a role in shaping Viking metal through the use of heavy guitar riffs, growling vocals, and themes related to Viking mythology and history. While Viking metal is primarily defined by its thematic and imagery content, these three genres are crucial in shaping its unique sound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Manchester United and England are irrelevant to Steele's transfer, as he had been playing for Barnsley for six years before the move to Panathinaikos. Glyfada and Athens are locations mentioned as part of the change in his life, but not relevant to his contract clause. Panathinaikos did not relegate, which is why a free transfer was possible.

Please answer the following question: What band is Black Francis the frontman for?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy.

He is calling the fiancee of his best friend Doug (Justin Bartha) and tells her that they messed up. \\"We lost Doug.\\" The fiancée, Tracy Garner (Sasha Barrese), flips because she and Doug are supposed to get married in 5 hours. \\"That's not going to happen.\\"Two days earlier, Doug and his soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are trying on tuxedos. Alan says it's OK if Doug doesn't bring him to the bachelor party tonight. Alan is severely socially inept but Doug makes it clear that he wants Alan to be there with him. Since they are going to be brothers soon, they have to look out for each other.Doug goes to talk to his father-in-law, Sid Garner (Jeffery Tambor), and is given permission to take his Mercedes to Vegas for the bachelor party since Sid remembers what it was like to be a young man. Doug thanks him and promises that he will be the only one to drive the car that day.

In the 2009 film \\"The Hangover,\\" the trio - Phil, Stu, and Alan - are not technically arrested, but they do encounter plenty of trouble and law enforcement officers throughout their chaotic adventure. The story revolves around a bachelor party in Las Vegas gone terribly wrong, as the trio wake up the morning after the party with no memory of the previous night. As they attempt to piece together what happened and find their missing friend, Doug, they discover that they have gotten involved in numerous incidents with potentially serious consequences. Here is a brief list of some encounters and issues that could have theoretically led to an arrest, though none resulted in the characters being taken into custody: 1. They stole a police cruiser: The trio ends up taking a police car that was left unattended after stealing it the night before. They then drive around Las Vegas with the car, which logically could lead to their arrest if caught by the police. However, they manage to return the car without getting caught. 2. They kidnapped a tiger: During their wild night, they involuntarily take possession of a tiger that belongs to Mike Tyson. This could have resulted in criminal charges if they were caught, considering that owning, stealing, or transporting exotic animals is illegal in many jurisdictions. Again, they manage to return the tiger without getting into trouble. 3. Stu marries a stripper: When retracing their steps, they realize that Stu married a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham) during their blackout. While this situation does not directly result in an arrest, the impromptu relationship further complicates their mission. 4. Illegal possession of drugs: Alan unknowingly spiked their drinks with a drug meant to help them relax but ended up causing severe memory loss instead. If the truth about the drugs were discovered, it could lead to charges against him. 5. Involvement with a criminal: Throughout their adventure, they learn that they have crossed paths with an eccentric Asian mobster named Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), who was initially kidnapped but later escapes, ensuing in high-stakes problems with the mobster. Their involvement with Mr. Chow could have put them in trouble with law enforcement if their ties were exposed. To sum it up, while the trio is never specifically arrested in the film, they find themselves in a series of dangerous and illegal situations throughout their Las Vegas bachelor party escapade. Their journey entails solving these predicaments while trying to locate Doug before his wedding ceremony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: What are the first names of the people that run a trial on a deceased dog? is inside the article: Medical researchers Frank and his fiancée, Zoe, have developed a serum, code-named \\"Lazarus\\". It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life. With the assistance of their friends, Niko, Clay,  and videographer Eva, they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog's brain. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project. Frank and his team sneak back into their lab to duplicate the experiment so that they can prove that they created the serum. During this attempt, things go horribly wrong and Zoe is fatally electrocuted. Unwilling to let her go, Frank uses the serum to resurrect her. Initially, the procedure appears to be a success, but the team soon realizes that something is wrong with Zoe.

Article:Mr Cameron, who is attending the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland, said fracking was already \\"flooring\\" energy prices in the US, and could be a \\"fresh driver\\" of UK growth. But government advisers say it may not lower UK energy prices much. Opponents say fracking can cause water contamination and environmental damage. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves drilling deep underground and releasing a high-pressure mix of water, sand and chemicals to crack rocks and release gas stored inside. The British Geological Survey estimates there may be 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas present in the north of England. Mr Cameron says this could deliver a large economic boost and ensure the supply of cheaper, more secure energy. In his speech to political and business leaders, Mr Cameron said foreign investment was contributing to a turn-around in the UK economy. But he argued the UK has to do more to encourage \\"re-shoring\\" - the return of businesses that have moved abroad to cut costs. Q&A: What is fracking?Cuadrilla vows not to frack Balcombe He said: \\"There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas, which is flooring US energy prices, with billions of dollars of energy cost-savings predicted over the next decade.\\" The prime minister called for a greater competitiveness, saying: \\"The key challenge for politicians and business leaders in Europe is how we make a success of globalisation. \\"For years the West has been written off. People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more. \\"Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision - the East wins while the West loses; and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way. \\"Of course, we shouldn't be starry-eyed about globalisation - it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt - but neither should we take this pessimistic view.\\" And Mr Cameron will point to a \\"small but discernible trend\\" of jobs coming back from the East to the West, highlighting a practice where production facilities were moved to low-cost countries. \\"A recent survey of small and medium-sized businesses found that more than one in 10 has brought back to Britain some production in the past year, more than double the proportion sending production in the opposite direction. \\" Mr Cameron warned other European countries about imposing \\"burdensome, unjustified and premature\\" regulations on fracking firms, saying these would force developers to go elsewhere. The UK Independence Party, which has also warned about EU rules hampering fracking in the UK, accused Mr Cameron of copying its policy. A spokesman said: \\"It's absolutely staggering. This is almost verbatim what (UKIP energy spokesman) Roger Helmer has been saying for months. \\"It just goes to show how much UKIP is steering UK politics from the wings when the prime minister reads out our policy to the World Economic Forum\\" Government advisers on the Committee on Climate Change, as well as Energy Secretary Ed Davey, have cast doubt on whether exploiting shale gas reserves in the UK will lead to lower energy prices. They suggest that relying heavily on gas for future electricity supplies will leave households vulnerable to higher bills in the long run as the price of gas on the international market is volatile. The UK will not benefit from substantially lower prices unless the rest of Europe decides to back shale gas too, as Europe has a gas grid that allows gas to be traded to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, some environmentalists fear potentially carcinogenic chemicals used in the process may escape and contaminate groundwater and that fracking could cause small earth tremors. They also argue that fracking is distracting energy firms and governments from investing in renewable sources of energy, and encouraging continued reliance on fossil fuels. \\"Shale gas is not the solution to the UK's energy challenges,\\" said Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth. \\"We need a 21st Century energy revolution based on efficiency and renewables, not more fossil fuels that will add to climate change.\\" Labour said the government had failed to deliver a \\"balanced recovery\\". \\"Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back,\\" shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said. \\"But after so many government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice.\\" \\"Labour would create a proper British Investment Bank supported by a network of regional banks, a skills system which delivers for businesses of all sizes and would cut business rates to help growing firms.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Attending the World Economic Forum at Davos, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron argued that hydraulic fracturing (fracking) could lead to lower energy prices and serve as a driver for economic growth in the country. He highlighted the impact of fracking on energy prices in the US and called for the development of shale gas in the UK while cautioning against imposing regulations on the industry. However, the Committee on Climate Change and Energy Secretary Ed Davey expressed doubts about whether exploiting shale gas would actually lead to lower energy costs and warned against reliance on volatile gas prices. Environmentalists and opponents of fracking raised concerns about potential water contamination, environmental damage, and maintaining a continued reliance on fossil fuels instead of investing in renewable energy sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who rescue an exotic local from her abusive dance partner? , can you please find it?   Josh Mallon and Ace Lannigan are best friends and work aboard the same ship. As their ship returns to the US after a long voyage, they see all the other sailors being mistreated by their wives and girlfriends, and the two friends pledge never to get involved with women again. Unfortunately, this vow is tested almost immediately. First, Ace is confronted by the family of a former lover, Cherry, who insist he marry her. Then Josh, who is the son of rich shipping magnate, has to fend off his fiancee, Gloria, and his father's wishes that he settle down and take over the family business. Things get worse when Josh and Ace get caught up fishing and turn up late for a party to celebrate Josh's engagement. Gloria's hostile drunken brother starts a fistfight and a news reporter takes photographs that cause a scandal. Josh and Ace flee to Hawaii and then head for Singapore. However, the pair only get as far as the island of Kaigoon before their money runs out. They rescue Mima, an exotic local (but not native) from her abusive dance-partner, Caesar, and she moves into their hut. Soon Mima is running the two men's lives, much to their chagrin. The trio try to make money in several different ways, including trying to sell a spot remover that is so bad it dissolves clothes. When Josh's father finally locates his wayward son, he and Gloria fly out to bring Josh back to face his responsibilities. The resentful Caesar leads them to where Ace, Josh and Mima are enjoying a local feast. By this point, both Josh and Ace have fallen in love with Mima. She is heartbroken to learn that Gloria is Josh's fiancee. Ace proposes to Mima, but before she can accept, Josh returns. The two friends almost come to blows over Mima, but then decide that she should choose between them. Mima picks Ace. Josh boards an ocean liner with Gloria and his father.

Write an article based on this summary: – Late last year, a Twitter user sent a flashing video to reporter Kurt Eichenwald, who has epilepsy, along with the message, \\"You deserve a seizure.\\" The Dallas Morning News reports the FBI on Friday morning made an arrest in the incident, which did in fact cause the Vanity Fair contributing editor and Newsweek senior writer to have a seizure. The suspect's name has not been released, but Eichenwald says the suspect is facing federal charges and will likely get additional charges from the Dallas DA, according to the Verge. Raw Story reports the sender of the strobe had already been suspended by Twitter. Eichenwald, who has covered President Trump since before his foray into politics, was sent the tweet after appearing on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight. He says more than 40 people sent him the same strobe after he spoke out about the first attack. Eichenwald says the FBI now has their information, as well, and people should stop sending him strobes. Article:","output":"Title: Arrest Made in Twitter Strobe Attack on Journalist Kurt Eichenwald, Further Charges Expected Last year, a malicious social media user targeted Kurt Eichenwald, a Vanity Fair contributing editor and Newsweek senior writer, with a harmful tweet aimed at his epilepsy condition. Today, the FBI reports that it has arrested the suspect involved in this disturbing incident. What may have initially seemed like a cruel prank on the surface has more severe underlying implications for those like Eichenwald who suffer from such health disorders. In late 2016, a flashing video was sent to Eichenwald via Twitter, accompanied by the message, \\"You deserve a seizure.\\" The intention of the tweet quickly became apparent as Eichenwald – who has been vocal about his epilepsy in the past – was indeed triggered into having a seizure. The sender of the strobe had their Twitter account suspended in light of the incident. Although the suspect's name has not been released, Eichenwald confirmed that the individual now faces federal charges, with the possibility of additional charges from the Dallas District Attorney, according to the Verge. This highlights the seriousness of the situation and the potential consequences for those who engage in such harmful online behavior. Eichenwald, who has been covering reports on President Trump even before his venture into politics, was targeted with the strobe image shortly after appearing on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight. It's a sad reality that targets of online harassment continue to endure personal attacks disguised as intended jokes or pranks. Unfortunately, following the first attack, more than 40 other individuals followed suit and sent out similar strobes to Eichenwald. Taking immediate action against this harassment, Eichenwald made sure the FBI was informed with their details as well, urging people to stop sending him strobes. This incident brings to the forefront discussions around online harassment and the potential dangers of using social media as a platform for personal attacks. Those who engage in activities intended to inflict harm on others must be held accountable for their actions. The arrest of the responsible individual involved in the strobe attack on Eichenwald serves as a warning to others who may consider engaging in such harmful behavior online. For people with epilepsy or other disabilities, the consequences can be severe and potentially life-threatening. Thus, these types of incidents and cyber-attacks cannot be taken lightly. The internet has opened doors for many positive aspects, including the ability to share information and connect with people worldwide. However, it also comes with a darker side – providing an avenue for malicious users to target and inflict harm on others. As in the case with Eichenwald, such attacks exemplify the importance of holding offenders accountable and raising awareness about the potential risks and consequences associated with online harassment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Venezuela mayor arrested for 'civil rebellion' over violent protests Venezuelan intelligence agents have arrested an opposition mayor accused of fomenting violent anti-government protest, while another was jailed for 10 months in the latest move against opponents of President Nicolás Maduro. Daniel Ceballos, mayor of western city of San Cristóbal, which has been a crucible of anti-government protest, was detained by the national intelligence service Sebin and accused of \\"civil rebellion\\". The interior minister, Miguel Rodríguez Torres, who also heads Sebin, told state TV that Ceballos was detained by agents acting on an order from court in western Tachira state. \\"This is an act of justice for a mayor who not only failed to meet his obligations under the law, but also facilitated and supported all the irrational violence in this city,\\" he said. \\"In the coming hours he will be presented before the corresponding tribunals to begin the judgment process.\\" Ceballos was arrested in Caracas, where he had been attending a meeting of opposition mayors, according to his aide Ronni Pavolini. \\"They took him out of the hotel in Caracas and took him to Helicoide [Sebin headquarters],\\" Pavolini told the Associated Press. San Cristóbal, home to 250,000 people, has been the focus of the most sustained fights between hooded demonstrators barricading roads, armed pro-government radicals, and the security forces. Torres said a member of the national guard was shot dead in the city on Wednesday during what he called \\"vandalistic acts\\" by protesters targeting a national armed forces university. Later on Wednesday, the supreme court jailed another opposition mayor, Enzo Scarano of San Diego in central Carabobo state, for 10 months and 15 days for failing to comply with a previous order to take down barricades there. In a statement, the court said Scarano would be stopped from exercising his functions as mayor. \\"All our solidarity with Enzo Scarano before this indescribable aggression,\\" tweeted Ramón Muchacho, mayor of the staunchly pro-opposition Chacao municipality in eastern Caracas, which has been the site of near-nightly street clashes. The mayors joined a high-profile opposition leader, Leopoldo López, who is being held on charges of arson and conspiracy, as leading government opponents jailed by Maduro's administration since the unrest began last month. The anti-government protests that have shaken Venezuela for more than a month began in early February with students in San Cristóbal, an opposition stronghold along the border with Colombia. Since then it has seen intense clashes between authorities and protesters frustrated by soaring inflation, rampant violent crime and shortages of basic items such as cooking oil and toilet paper. Late on Wednesday, the federal prosecutor's office said that, according to preliminary information, national guardsman Jhon Rafael Castillo Castillo, 23, was killed while breaking up protests near a local university in San Cristóbal. He would be the fifth national guardsmen killed during the protests. Meanwhile, about 15 miles from San Cristóbal, national guardsmen firing plastic shotgun pellets and tear gas wounded at least 16 people in the town of Rubio as they cleared barricades that had been up for weeks, local officials said. \\"The situation is terrible here,\\" Francisco Rincon, vice-president of Rubio municipal council, told the Associated Press. He said soldiers with rifles were on the street corners. He said he had counted 16 wounded, four of them by bullets. Rincon, who is a member of the opposition Popular Will party, said their supporters had protested peacefully in the morning before being dispersed by tear gas and plastic buckshot by national guardsmen and pro-government civilians. In Caracas, officials said a municipal worker was shot and killed while removing a street barricade in a middle-class neighbourhood. His death raised to 28 the official toll from more than a month's worth of protests. The federal prosecutor's office said Francisco Alcides Madrid Rosendo, 32, was shot multiple times around 10pm on Tuesday while he and others were taking down a barricade in the Montalbán neighbourhood in Caracas's western section. The pro-government Caracas mayor, Jorge Rodríguez, through his Twitter account blamed unnamed \\"terrorists\\" for the killing, but provided no other details. Venezuela's national assembly on Tuesday voted to start a process to strip opposition politician María Corina Machado of her immunity so thatcharges could eventually be brought against her for allegedly trying to destabilise the government. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"In Venezuela, an opposition mayor named Daniel Ceballos from the city of San Cristóbal was arrested by intelligence agents. They accused him of causing violent anti-government protests, which is called \\"civil rebellion.\\" They think he did not follow his law obligations and that he helped make the violence even worse. He will go to court to face judgment. Another opposition mayor, Enzo Scarano from San Diego, got put in jail for a little over 10 months because he didn't follow an order to remove barricades. The protests started because people are not happy with things like high prices, unsafe streets, and not enough basic things like cooking oil or toilet paper. These protests have led to more than a month of violence and at least 28 people have died."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

She still lives in family memories, in the thoughts of her friends and co-workers, in the values she had instilled  in her children, and in the lovely flower gardens that she had so carefully tended. She loved her gladioli and irises. Each fall she would dig the bulbs out of the soil and carefully wrap them in paper. The bulbs would be stored until the following spring when they would be replanted. It seemed like a lot of effort to me, but each year her flower garden was more glorious than the year before. She put the same hard work into caring for her family, instilling in her children a sense of justice and fair play, compassion, and strong moral values so that we blossomed.

The banks will not automatically reach out when a cardholder becomes deceased. If you wait to cancel the cards, it's possible that the account will be charged late fees or interest in the interim. Can we draw the following conclusion? This is only applicable when the person has died Select from: a). Yes. b). It's impossible to say. c). No.","output":"a). Yes. The passage provided discusses the steps to be taken in canceling credit cards after someone has passed away. The need to cancel cards arises because the banks will not automatically take action upon someone's death, and may continue to charge late fees or interest in the meantime. Hence, we can conclude that this situation is applicable when the person has died. However, to provide a more comprehensive answer, here is a detailed guide on how to cancel credit cards after someone is deceased: 1. Obtain multiple copies of the death certificate: You will need to provide proof of the cardholder's death to the banks, and having multiple copies ensures you have enough for all institutions you'll need to contact. 2. Create a list of all credit card accounts: Gather statements and go through the deceased person's files to identify all the active credit cards they held. 3. Get in touch with the executor of the estate: If you are not the executor or administrator of the deceased person's estate, contact them as they will be responsible for settling debts and managing the deceased person's financial matters. 4. Contact the credit card companies: As the next of kin, executor, or administrator, call each credit card company and inform them of the account holder's death. You may be asked to provide the deceased person's Social Security Number, account number, and the date of death. Also, provide your contact information, your relationship to the deceased, and a copy of the death certificate, if required. 5. Verify if the deceased had any credit card protection plans: Some credit cards offer protection plans that cover outstanding balances in the case of the cardholder's death. If the deceased person had enrolled in such a plan, find out the process for filing a claim. 6. Pay any outstanding debts, if feasible: Debts of a deceased person are usually covered by their estate. If there are sufficient assets to cover the outstanding debts, you should initiate the process of repaying the credit card balances. Keep in mind that spouses or authorized users may also be responsible for paying off these debts. 7. Monitor the accounts: Track the accounts to ensure that they get canceled and no new charges or fees are added. In case you face any issues, contact the credit card company to resolve the matter. 8. Notify credit bureaus: Report the death to the three major credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. This is important to prevent identity theft and to ensure that the individual's credit report is updated accordingly. By following these steps, you can handle the process of canceling credit cards after someone is deceased in a smooth and organized manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translate to English","output":"The European Central Bank must appoint its representative to the committee based on monetary policy, and the member states do the same based on the various components of economic policy. The European Central Bank (ECB) is the institution responsible for the monetary policy of the member countries of the European Union that use the euro as their currency. The ECB's primary objective is to maintain price stability within the euro area, which can contribute to sustainable economic growth and improved living standards. To achieve this goal, the ECB sets key interest rates and manages the money supply. In order to effectively manage the euro area's monetary policy, coordination and cooperation between the ECB and the European Union's member states are essential. This is achieved by the establishment of committees, where representatives from the ECB and the member states work together to exchange information, maintain a common understanding of economic developments, and determine the best course of action to achieve their shared objectives. The ECB appoints its representative to the committee based on their expertise in monetary policy. This ensures that the decisions made within the committee are well-informed and grounded in the principles of sound monetary policy management. Member states of the European Union also appoint their representatives to the committee, but instead of focusing solely on monetary policy, they focus on the various components of economic policy. Economic policy is a broad term that encompasses a range of policies and actions a government might take to influence the economy, such as fiscal policy (government spending and taxation), structural policies (aimed at improving labor market and business conditions), and financial regulation. By designating representatives based on their expertise in economic policy, member states ensure that the committee benefits from a wide range of perspectives and understanding of the diverse economic situations and challenges each nation faces. This allows the committee to develop a more comprehensive approach to achieving economic stability and sustainable growth within their respective jurisdictions and contributes to the overall well-being of the entire European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The people who read the news are called news presenters and because they appear on television every day, they are very famous.

They must always keep calm even when there are many changes during the program. At the end of \\"News at Ten\\"Trevor McDonald says \\"And finally...\\". Then he reads an unusual or interesting item.

They include: the right to life and to exist; the right to continue vital cycles and processes free from human alteration; the right to pure water and clean air; the right to balance; the right not to be polluted; and the right to not have cellular structure modified or genetically altered.      Controversially, it will also enshrine the right of nature \\"to not be affected by mega-infrastructure and development projects that affect the balance of ecosystems and the local inhabitant communities\\".      \\"It makes world history. Earth is the mother of all\\", said Vice-President Alvaro García Linera. \\"It establishes a new relationship between man and nature, the harmony of which must be preserved as a guarantee of its regeneration.\\"      The law, which is part of a complete restructuring of the Bolivian legal system following a change of constitution in 2009, has been heavily influenced by a resurgent indigenous Andean spiritual world view which places the environment and the earth deity known as the Pachamama at the centre of all life. Humans are considered equal to all other entities.      But the abstract new laws are not expected to stop industry in its tracks. While it is not clear yet what actual protection the new rights will give in court to bugs, insects and ecosystems, the government is expected to establish a ministry of mother earth and to appoint an ombudsman. It is also committed to giving communities new legal powers to monitor and control polluting industries.      Bolivia has long suffered from serious environmental problems from the mining of tin, silver, gold and other raw materials. \\"Existing laws are not strong enough,\\" said Undarico Pinto, leader of the 3.5m-strong Confederación Sindical Única de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia, the biggest social movement, who helped draft the law. \\"It will make industry more transparent. It will allow people to regulate industry at national, regional and local levels.\\"      Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said Bolivia's traditional indigenous respect for the Pachamama was vital to prevent climate change. \\"Our grandparents taught us that we belong to a big family of plants and animals. We believe that everything in the planet forms part of a big family. We indigenous people can contribute to solving the energy, climate, food and financial crises with our values,\\" he said.      Little opposition is expected to the law being passed because President Evo Morales's ruling party, the Movement Towards Socialism, enjoys a comfortable majority in both houses of parliament.      However, the government must tread a fine line between increased regulation of companies and giving way to the powerful social movements who have pressed for the law. Bolivia earns 500m (£305m) a year from mining companies which provides nearly one third of the country's foreign currency.      In the indigenous philosophy, the Pachamama is a living being.      The draft of the new law states: \\"She is sacred, fertile and the source of life that feeds and cares for all living beings in her womb. She is in permanent balance, harmony and communication with the cosmos. She is comprised of all ecosystems and living beings, and their self-organisation.\\"      Ecuador, which also has powerful indigenous groups, has changed its constitution to give nature \\"the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution\\". However, the abstract rights have not led to new laws or stopped oil companies from destroying some of the most biologically rich areas of the Amazon.      Coping with climate change      Bolivia is struggling to cope with rising temperatures, melting glaciers and more extreme weather events including more frequent floods, droughts, frosts and mudslides.      Research by glaciologist Edson Ramirez of San Andres University in the capital city, La Paz, suggests temperatures have been rising steadily for 60 years and started to accelerate in 1979. They are now on course to rise a further 3.5-4C over the next 100 years. This would turn much of Bolivia into a desert.      Most glaciers below 5,000m are expected to disappear completely within 20 years, leaving Bolivia with a much smaller ice cap. Scientists say this will lead to a crisis in farming and water shortages in cities such as La Paz and El Alto.      Evo Morales, Latin America's first indigenous president, has become an outspoken critic in the UN of industrialised countries which are not prepared to hold temperatures to a 1C rise. ||||| Flickr/Phillie Casablanca      Bolivia is to pass a law -- called la Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra (The Law of Mother Earth) -- which will grant nature equal rights to humans.      The law -- the first of its kind -- aims to encourage a major shift in attitudes towards conservation and to reduce pollution and exploitation of natural resources. It sees a range of new rights established for nature including the right to life; the right to water and clean air; the right to repair livelihoods affected by human activities and the right to be free of pollution.      Bolivia is one of South America's poorest countries and is seeing its rural communities suffer with failing crops due to climatic events such as floods and droughts. Temperatures are set to rise by up to four degrees celsius over the next 100 years, while most of its glaciers are likely to melt within 20 years.      The Bolivian government -- under president Evo Morales -- will establish a ministry of mother earth and commit to give communities the authority to monitor and control the industries and businesses that are polluting the environment.      The belief is that industrial entities can learn from the traditions of indigenous populations who have a deep-rooted respect for the environment. The notion of \\"Pachamama\\" or the spiritual entity similar to the idea mother earth, is increasingly being referred to in governmental discussions and documents.      It is not clear at this stage how the somewhat abstract legislation would be implemented. The state will need to be careful to balance the rights of nature with the regulation of industries (such as mining) that contribute a significant chunk of the country's GDP.      Bolivia has been extremely forthright in the global arena and has called for developed countries to contribute one percent of GDP to help poor and vulnerable nations. Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca has been quoted saying that western development has created a \\"deathly wound to our Pachamama\\".

Write a text based on this summary: archbishop of canterbury says pope visit was a success despite continuing differences Text:","output":"Title: Archbishop of Canterbury Commends Pope's Visit as a Success Amidst Ongoing Differences The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, recently praised Pope Francis's visit to the United Kingdom as a notable success despite the continuing differences and divisions between the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church. As the spiritual leaders of their respective Christian denominations, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope play crucial roles in fostering understanding and dialogue between their faith communities. Pope Francis arrived in the United Kingdom for a state visit full of carefully planned interfaith dialogues, discussions on shared concerns, and opportunities to celebrate the achievements of both churches in their collaborative works. Part of the Pope's mission during this visit was to engage with the Anglican Communion, which is the worldwide family of churches with the Archbishop of Canterbury as its figurehead, and to stress the importance of working together for the common good. From the moment Pope Francis arrived on British soil, he was greeted with enthusiasm from local communities, religious leaders, and representatives from all walks of life. Archbishop Welby warmly welcomed the Pope and expressed his appreciation for the significant efforts taken by the Holy See towards building bridges during these challenging times. Despite the ongoing theological differences and historical events that led to the schism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, the Pope and the Archbishop engaged in a series of fruitful discussions addressing a range of issues, including the environment, social justice, and the urgent need to combat human trafficking. The visit encompassed numerous events highlighting the shared heritage and common goals between the two churches. One such event was a service of Vespers at Westminster Abbey, where both leaders, along with other dignitaries from the religious and political spheres, prayed side by side for Christian unity and global peace. This solemn event demonstrated the power of coming together despite differing perspectives and held a symbolic importance for both communities. Throughout the trip, both leaders acknowledged the significant historical challenges that have beset their respective churches. However, through open and frank dialogue, they found hope in a shared vision focused on addressing global crises and promoting unity among Christian communities. Archbishop Welby expressed an optimistic outlook, stating that while there may never be full communion between the two churches, there still remains a considerable scope for fruitful partnerships in addressing the world's most pressing problems. The Pope's visit also offered a platform for members of both the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church to engage in shared acts of charity and community outreach, further highlighting the value of interfaith work. Although differences and divisions still exist between these two global Christian communities, Archbishop Welby's characterization of the Pope's visit as a success marks a promising step forward in efforts to strengthen relationships, promote dialogue, and encourage collaboration on shared goals. The Pope and the Archbishop demonstrated humility and grace throughout their conversations, skillfully navigating the complicated history and present-day dynamics between their respective churches. In doing so, they have set an inspiring example of the potential for deepening spiritual bonds and creating a more united and compassionate world for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Richard Alan Enberg (January 9, 1935 - December 21, 2017) was an American sportscaster. Over the course of an approximately 60-year career, he provided play-by-play for various sports on numerous radio and television networks, including NBC (1975-1999), CBS (2000-2014), and ESPN (2004-2011), as well for individual teams, such as UCLA Bruins basketball, Los Angeles Rams, California Angels and San Diego Padres. Enberg was well known for his signature on-air catchphrases \\"Touch 'em all\\" (for home runs) and \\"Oh, my!\\" (for particularly exciting and outstanding athletic plays). In the late 1960s, Enberg began a full-time sportscasting career in Los Angeles, working for KTLA television (anchoring a nightly sports report and calling UCLA Bruins basketball) and KMPC radio (calling Los Angeles Rams football and California Angels baseball). After every Angels victory, he would wrap up his broadcast with, \\"And the halo shines tonight,\\" in reference to the \\"Big A\\" scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium and the halo at the top, which would light up for everyone in the area to see, particularly from the adjacent freeway. Enberg was named California Sportscaster of the Year four times during this period.  In the 1960s, Enberg announced boxing matches at L.A.'s Olympic Auditorium.  In 1968, Enberg was recommended by UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan to be the national broadcaster for the syndicated TVS Television Network to cover the \\"Game of the Century\\" between the Houston Cougars, led by Elvin Hayes and the UCLA Bruins, led by Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The \\"Prime Time\\" nationally televised game demonstrated that college basketball had a national \\"Prime Time\\" audience and stands as a seminal contest in the evolution of nationally televised evening college basketball broadcasts. Enberg continued to call the occasional UCLA game for TVS through the early 1970s, usually teaming with Rod Hundley. In 1973, Enberg traveled to Beijing, China to host the groundbreaking TVS Television Network telecast of the USA vs. China basketball game. It was the first team sporting event ever played between China and the USA.  In the 1970s, Enberg called the 1979 NCAA Championship game between Michigan State, led by Magic Johnson, and Indiana State, led by Larry Bird. He also hosted the syndicated television game show Sports Challenge, and co-produced the Emmy Award-winning sports-history series The Way It Was for PBS.  In the 1970 opening conference game in Pauley Pavilion, Oregon went into a stall against the UCLA Bruins. Enberg had run out of statistics and began to fill his radio broadcast with small talk. The movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had just been released, and Enberg was humming the tune to \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\\", but did not know the words. Two nights later, in a home game against Oregon State, many UCLA students brought the lyrics to the song. Enberg promised that he would sing the song if UCLA won the conference championship. He sang the song following the final game of the season. The event was recorded in the Los Angeles Times and was later recounted in the book Pauley Pavilion: College Basketball's Showplace by David Smale. During the 2006 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship broadcast, there was a short feature on the event.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he do while in Los Angeles?","output":"While in Los Angeles, Richard Alan Enberg \\"began a full-time sportscasting career, working for KTLA television (anchoring a nightly sports report and calling UCLA Bruins basketball) and KMPC radio (calling Los Angeles Rams football and California Angels baseball).\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This desire stemmed from her admiration for Emily and her friends, who were seen as the epitome of cool and fashionable in their social circle. However, Elena's journey to becoming a member of Emily's clique was not an easy one, as it involved her having to navigate the complex dynamics of teenage friendships, adapt her own interests, and demonstrate her compatibility with the group's values and ideals in order to secure her place among them. Ultimately, Elena's perseverance paid off, showing that her passion for being part of this group was stronger than any potential obstacles. From the moment Elena set her sights on becoming a part of Emily's clique, she embarked on a carefully thought-out plan to catch Emily's attention and the attention of her friends. Knowing that her own interests and hobbies were different from that of the clique, Elena began to explore and participate in the activities her potential new friends enjoyed. By doing so, she was able to find common ground with Emily and the other members, and provide ample opportunities for conversation and bonding. Elena could often be found attending the same parties and events where Emily and her friends were present, eagerly trying to make her presence known without coming across as overly eager. Elena opted for a subtle yet effective approach in which she would casually converse with Emily whenever they crossed paths, gradually fostering their friendship. In these interactions, Elena took the time to listen to what interested Emily and her friends, and to share her own stories and inside jokes in order to create a sense of camaraderie. As time went on, Elena's persistence began to pay off, with Emily and her friends slowly becoming more receptive to her presence and attempts to forge connections. To further integrate herself within the clique, Elena began to closely follow the fashion trends and styles that her potential new friends favored, ensuring that her image fit the mold of their group. This also extended to her social media presence, where she posted photos and content that were in line with the interests of Emily's clique, demonstrating how much she desired to fit in. However, Elena also understood the importance of maintaining her individuality and making her own unique contributions, all while ensuring that she did not clash with the clique's established traditions and practices. She brought her own talents and ideas to the table, which helped to enrich and deepen the clique's existing bonds and activities. For example, Elena had a talent for photography and suggested they collaborate on a photo shoot, which was a big hit and ultimately became a regular outing for the group. Through her determination, intelligence, and genuine enthusiasm to join Emily's clique, Elena eventually succeeded in becoming a valued member of the group. While at times the journey was demanding, she managed to navigate the treacherous waters of teenage friendships and remain true to herself in the process. Elena's story serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and a reminder that the pursuit of one's goals, even in the realm of social circles, can lead to success if approached with skill, dedication, and the unwavering enthusiasm that Elena showcased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate Answer:","output":"The final step of the aluminum recycling process, after the ingots have been transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate, is to shape and transform the rolled aluminum into new products. This is done through various methods such as extrusion, forging, and fabrication. The new aluminum products can range from automotive parts, construction materials, and packaging materials to consumer goods such as cans, foils, and electronics. Extrusion is the process of forcing the rolled aluminum through a die with a specific cross-sectional profile to produce long lengths of material with uniform dimensions. Some applications of extruded aluminum include window and door frames, tubing, and structural components for buildings and vehicles. Forging involves shaping the rolled aluminum by applying compressive forces through the use of presses, hammers, and dies. In this process, the aluminum is heated to a specific temperature to make it more malleable and then formed into the desired shape. Forged aluminum is utilized in components that require high strength, such as aircraft parts, automotive components, and heavy-duty machinery. Fabrication is the assembly and combination of multiple aluminum parts to create a final product. Fabrication processes can include cutting, bending, welding, and fastening of aluminum pieces. Examples of fabricated aluminum products are automotive frames, fences, and commercial structures. Once the new aluminum products are manufactured, they are ready to be distributed and used in various industries. This completes the recycling process, contributing to a circular economy and reducing the need for mining new raw materials. Recycling aluminum saves energy, conserves natural resources, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, making it an environmentally friendly and sustainable practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Process: - The sun gives off radiation - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped - Global warming occurs.  Question: suppose hurting mitosis to proceed normally happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"C: no effect To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between mitosis, greenhouse effect, and global warming. Mitosis is the process of cell division, during which a parent cell duplicates its genetic material and divides into two identical daughter cells. This process is essential for growth, development, and tissue repair in living organisms. It plays no direct role in the greenhouse effect or global warming.  The greenhouse effect, on the other hand, refers to the natural process that takes place in Earth's atmosphere where particular gases, known as greenhouse gases (GHGs), trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface. Some of this heat is re-radiated back towards the Earth, maintaining the planet's overall temperature. In general, the greenhouse effect is vital for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet's temperature within a suitable range for living organisms. Global warming occurs when this natural process is amplified due to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, resulting in GHG emissions, cause a rise in global temperatures which leads to a range of environmental and climatic consequences. Now, supposing we hurt mitosis, causing it to not proceed normally, the effect on the greenhouse effect would essentially be negligible. This is because the greenhouse effect is governed by physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere, such as the absorption, reflection, and emission of radiation, rather than biological processes like mitosis. Additionally, a smaller greenhouse effect cannot be directly affected by changes in mitotic processes. Any changes in mitosis would impact the growth and development of organisms and might, in certain cases, indirectly affect the global ecosystem. However, this would not specifically influence the behavior of greenhouse gases and Earth's radiation balance. In conclusion, hurting mitosis to prevent it from proceeding normally would not have a direct effect on the greenhouse effect, either making it larger or smaller. So, the answer is C: no effect. The two phenomena are related to the biological process of life and the atmospheric process of heat retention, respectively. They operate in different domains and are not interconnected in a way that would cause changes in mitosis to influence the greenhouse effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question The Raiders returned home to face the San Diego Chargers in their first division game of the season. However, the Raiders offense struggled to score early, unable to score a touchdown on three offensive possessions in Charger territory in the first half and turning the ball over early. Derek Carr was picked on the fourth play from scrimmage, setting up the Chargers for a chance to take an early lead. However, the Raiders defense forced a fumble and prevented the Chargers from scoring. The Raiders offense could not take advantage, only managing three field goals in the first half by Sebastian Janikowski, however he missed a fourth attempt. Tyrell Williams scored for the Chargers on a 29-yard pass from Philip Rivers and the Chargers took a 10-9 lead into the half. In the second half, the Chargers took a 17-9 lead on Melvin Gordon reception from Rivers. The Raiders answered on a 64-yard pitch and catch from Carr to Amari Cooper, his first touchdown catch of the year. However, the Raiders defense continued its struggles, giving up another touchdown pass from Rivers to Hunter Henry as the Raiders fell behind 24-16. A 48-yard field goal by Janikowski brought the Raiders within five before the Raider defense garnered its third turnover of the game, forcing a Gordon fumble. The Raider offense struggled in response and were left with a fourth and two from the Charger 21-yard line. Continuing with the season's gutsy calls, head coach Jack Del Rio went for it and Carr found Michael Crabtree for a diving catch in the corner of the endzone to give the Raiders their first lead of the game. The Raiders added on from there, scoring a touchdown on a Jamize Olawale one-yard run seemingly salting the game away, 34-24. However, the Raider defense allowed the Chargers to move within three on a 76-yard drive capped by an Antonio Gates touchdown catch. Trailing 34-31, the Charges again moved into Raider territory in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter. Forced to attempt a game-tying field goal, the Chargers fumbled the snap and the Raiders were able to run out the clock. Moving to 4-1 on the season, the first time since 2002, the Raider defense still surrendered over 400 yards for the fourth time in five games this season. Del Rio was angered by the continued poor defensive showing. Despite this and combined with a loss by the Denver Broncos, the Raiders moved into a tie for first place in the AFC West.

His destination is the Lion's Head Pub and Inn. The place is a buzz of activity: drinking and laughing, and a game of darts. The stranger, Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains) walks in covered from head to toe, head bandaged, and wearing a false nose. All sound in the Pub ceases. The stranger approaches the proprietor, Herbert Hall (Forrester Harvey) and requests, \\"I want a room and a fire.\\" Hall calls to his wife, Jenny (Una OConnor). Jenny explains they have no rooms ready, as summer is their normal season, but one can be prepared. Jenny calls to Minnie (Merle Tottenham). Jenny leads Dr. Griffin to his room, sending Minnie on ahead. Minnie lights a lamp while Jenny builds a fire and explains, \\"It's the coldest winter we've had down here for years.\\" Griffin asks about his luggage, but Jenny explains she'll arrange for it in the morning. His final request before Jenny departs is for some food. Griffin closes the drapes in his room.The townsfolk are suspicious of the stranger. One man speculates, \\"If you ask me, he's a criminal flying from justice.\\" He advises Herbert to lockup his money. Jenny carries a tray up to his room and walks in without knocking. Griffin asks about a key and is told there is none. He emphatically states, \\"I want to be left alone and undisturbed.\\" Jenny leaves and Griffin removes his coat. Jenny returns to the kitchen only to be told by Minnie that she forgot the mustard. Jenny makes a second trip to Griffin's room. Again she does not knock, just bursts in. Griffin is seated, and the lower half of his face is gone. Jenny is shocked by what she sees as Griffin masks his face with a napkin.

We have this equation: 0 = -768*q + 772*q + 40 Think of it like we have two bags of candies but one has a - sign in front of it. We want to find out how many candies we have in total! First, let's add the candies with the same colors (the q's): -768*q and 772*q are like two different bags of candies. If we add these two bags together: -768*q + 772*q = 4*q (It's like taking away 768 candies from 772 candies, so we're left with 4 candies in our bag) Now our equation looks like this: 0 = 4*q + 40 Next, let's take away the 40 candies that are separate from the candies with q's: 0 - 40 = 4*q - 40 -40 = 4*q Now, we just have one bag of 4 candies with a q. We want to know how many q's are in that bag, so we just need to divide -40 by 4: -40 / 4 = -10 So, there are -10 q's in our bag. The solution is q = -10. Great job!

Q: What's the name for the process where pollen is transferred to the ovules of a seed plant?   A: Answer:","output":"The name for the process where pollen is transferred to the ovules of a seed plant is called pollination. Pollination is a crucial phase in the reproductive cycle of seed-producing plants. It occurs when the male reproductive cell, or pollen grain, from a plant's anther (the part of the stamen that bears the pollen) comes into contact with the female reproductive cell (gamete) or ovule, which resides within the pistil (the female reproductive organ) of another plant or within the same plant in self-pollinated species. There are two primary types of pollination - self-pollination and cross-pollination. 1. Self-pollination: This occurs when pollen from a plant's anther is transferred to the stigma (the receptive surface of the pistil) of the same plant or genetically identical individual. Self-pollination can happen through different mechanisms, such as the bending of the flower parts or the anther release of pollen later in the flowering stage after the ovule has matured. 2. Cross-pollination: In this type of pollination, pollen from an individual plant is transferred to the stigma of another genetically different plant. Cross-pollination encourages genetic diversity, which can lead to plants that are more resilient, adaptable, and likely to survive in various environmental conditions. Cross-pollination can be facilitated by various agents, including wind, water, insects, and animals such as birds and bats. Some common ways in which cross-pollination is facilitated include: 1. Wind pollination: Many seed plants, including grasses, conifers, and some deciduous trees, rely on wind to disperse their pollen. These plants produce vast amounts of lightweight pollen, which becomes airborne and travels distances, increasing the chances of reaching the stigma of another plant. 2. Animal pollination: Some plants have evolved specialized mechanisms to attract pollinators, such as insects, birds, bats, or rodents. Brightly colored flowers, pleasing scents, and nectar rewards encourage animals to visit these plants. As the animals move from flower to flower to collect nectar or pollen, they inadvertently transfer pollen from one plant to another, facilitating pollination. 3. Water pollination: Relatively rare and confined to some aquatic plants, this pollination type occurs when pollen is released underwater or onto the water surface, drifting to other plants via water currents. Pollination is a vital process in the lifecycle of seed-producing plants, allowing them to sexually reproduce and create the next generation of their species. This process results in the formation of seeds, enabling the plant to propagate and spread into new environments, ensuring the survival and evolution of diverse plant life across the planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff.

In 1756, the Marquis de Vaudreuil was informed that King Louis XV of France was sending the Marquis Louis-Joseph de Montcalm to take over French forces in North America, with Lévis as second in command. Vaudreuil wrote back that there was no need to send another general, as Vaudreuil disliked the tactics of most \\"municipal\\" French generals. When Montcalm arrived despite Vaudreuil's protest, the two men developed a dislike for each other. Lévis diplomatically cultivated good relations with both men, and managed to avoid getting dragged into the feuds between the two. Lévis led the vanguard of the French expedition to Fort William Henry in 1757, and laid siege to it until Montcalm's arrival. During French planning for the 1758 campaign in the French and Indian War the disputes between Vaudreuil and Montcalm continued. Vaudreuil prevailed, and Montcalm was sent to Fort Carillon to defend it against an expected British attack. Lévis was initially slated to lead an expedition to the western forts, leading about 500 French metropolitan troops and a large seasoned French-Canadian militia. Vaudreuil, however, had second thoughts, and dispatched Lévis and his metropolitan troops to support Montcalm at Carillon. Lévis arrived at Carillon on the evening of July 7, as a British army was arriving before the fort. The next day, in a stroke of good fortune for the defenders, the 16,000 strong British army under the command of General James Abercrombie decided to frontally attack the French defenses manned by about 4,000 men, without the benefit of artillery support. In the Battle of Carillon, the British were decisively defeated, with Lévis leading the defense on the French right flank. Based on the above article, answer a question.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\".

And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits.

The woman gazes lovingly into the cat's mesmerizing emerald eyes, which seem to hold a secret, ancient wisdom that she could never really comprehend. As she runs her fingers along the contours of its delicate, striped coat, she begins to reminisce about the first day they met. It was a late autumn evening, and she had just moved into her quaint but charming old house on the outskirts of a picturesque little town. Exhausted from the day of unpacking and organizing, she had decided to treat herself to a quiet walk through the woods that outlined her property. There, amid the sounds of rustling leaves, her attention was captured by a pitiful meow, barely audible beneath the cacophony of the forest. Dutifully, she followed the faint sound, her maternal instincts kicking in, until she stumbled upon a tiny, shivering bundle of fur entangled in a thorny thicket. Her heart ached at the sight of the helpless creature, and with tender care, she carefully disentangled the poor kitten and swaddled it in the softness of her favorite scarf. They had been inseparable ever since that fateful day. Every now and then, the woman felt as though the cat knew she had saved its life and seemed to express its gratitude through small acts of affection, like curling up on her chest on a cold winter night or welcoming her home with a symphony of excited purrs. As the only living thing she shared her home with, the cat had become her constant companion and confidant, providing her with solace and stability in the midst of life's many trials. Together, they had experienced the gamut of human emotion – the joy of new beginnings, the heartache of loss, and the quiet triumph of enduring love. Sitting there in the soft light of the bathroom, she couldn't help but feel grateful for having found her benevolent feline guardian all those years ago and shared one contented, serene moment together before life's next inevitable challenge would arise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times But here, we stapled the sheets together and slid them into an envelope at the back of a cabinet labeled “Undocumented.” Unlike most of our other patients, Carlos didn’t have any identification. He gladly paid out of pocket for ointments and creams for incidental cuts and bruises. But what he really needed was a biopsy, a 200 procedure that, given the location of the mass in his neck, could not be done safely in the back of a van. We could find no medical office willing to schedule an appointment for a man without identification. One private hospital sent us a typed note: “This unfortunate gentleman will not be eligible for services here.” We told Carlos to go to the emergency room of the public hospital, San Francisco General. He was not yet sick enough to be formally admitted, though, so he sat on a gurney for six hours and was charged 1,085 for a bag of intravenous salt water he didn’t really need. He was passed a note instructing him to “follow up with your primary care provider.” The hospital eventually gave him an appointment for a biopsy; it was scheduled in five months and three weeks. Carlos kept the yellow appointment slip in the front pocket of his overalls. He would bike with it; his sweat stained the paper until the edges wore thin. “I will not miss this,” he said whenever we reminded him of the date. As a temporizing show of support before his biopsy, we would see him every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. He would roll in, wheezing, but would smile after a brief breathing treatment or 15 minutes with a heating pad on his shoulder. During those early weeks of September, the health care debates raged on television. We watched as President Obama told Congress that illegal immigrants would not get health care coverage. We heard someone yell, “You lie!” On any given day, the bodies of illegal immigrants lie in San Francisco’s coroner’s office, found by police or firefighters in alleys or on sidewalks, unclaimed and unnamed. Before they died, their medical costs may well have been passed on to taxpayers. But it’s also true that many were taxpayers themselves. From 2000 to 2005, illegal immigrant workers paid an estimated 6 billion to 7 billion in Social Security taxes and about 1.5 billion to Medicare, according to the Social Security Administration. And the president’s Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that illegal immigrants pay 80,000 more in taxes per person than they consume in government benefits over their lifetimes. The question of whether to insure Carlos and others like him is really a decision about whether to pay now or later — that is, to pay for preventive medical care now, or to pay in the future for hospital and emergency services, or for the internment of unclaimed bodies. Carlos stopped coming to his appointments. Our driver would wait an extra 30 minutes for him to reappear, brushing off demands from traffic cops to make way for the evening restaurant crowd. Weeks passed. Carlos’s friends from the docks approached the van, wondering if we had seen him. Early one morning, a clerk at the public hospital handed me a message. Carlos’s red bike had turned up at a police auction. Sold, for 32. I fear the growth in his throat may have been cancer, that it may have killed him. The coroner’s office cannot tell us, but it would not be that surprising, really. At the age of 50, Carlos already had surpassed by an entire year the average life expectancy of a migrant laborer in the United States.

Carlos had a mass on his neck and needed a biopsy, a procedure he couldn’t obtain without identification or pay for out-of-pocket due to its 200 cost. When he visited a public hospital, he was not admitted due to his condition not being severe, incurring over 1000 for intravenous treatment. An appointment for the required biopsy was scheduled nearly six months away, despite the urgency of his condition. The piece concludes with Carlos failing to show up for further appointments and his whereabouts are unknown after his bicycle is found at a police auction. The fate of Carlos highlights the issue of undocumented immigrants' healthcare access, debating whether to cover preventive care costs now or deal with disastrous consequences, including emergency services and interments, later. The article also underscores the fact that many undocumented immigrants, despite their status, contribute billions of dollars in taxes while utilizing fewer government benefits.

Article: The Lunar New Year, which starts in late January this year, is the most important festival for Chinese people as most of them drop any business at hand to go back to their hometown to see their families. It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad. I've heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket, only to find it a mission impossible. Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season. What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season.

Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story.

Thorughout the film, the story reverts for short periods back to the KXLA studio for dialogue between Joe and Zander.Pivotal to Joe's story is the past relationship he reveals between himself and Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a beautiful farm girl from his adopted hometown of Silvertown, Idaho. Joe feels that Brandy and his dog, Charlie, were the only real friends he ever had. After living in and leaving a series of bizarre foster homes, Joe met Brandy one winter when he was living in the woods outside Silvertown and Charlie's testicles became frozen to the front porch of Brandy's house. Brandy helped Joe and Charlie and for the next few years the three spent most of their time together.Believing that Brandy is \\"too hot\\" to ever love a guy like him, Joe is blind to the fact that she obviously has very real feelings for him.

Peraza was Miss Venezuela 1976 , but she resigned on May 24 , 1976 , because she married two days after her coronation . OPT:  1). no  2). yes The answer is:","output":"2). yes Both sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although they are phrased slightly differently. They both tell the reader that Peraza was crowned Miss Venezuela in the year 1976, but she had to resign her title on May 24, 1976, due to getting married just two days after her crowning or coronation. The differences between the two sentences mainly lie in their structure and choice of words.  In the first sentence, \\"In 1976, Peraza was Miss Venezuela\\" is used to present the information about the year she held the title. In the second sentence, the year is integrated into the title itself, stating that \\"Peraza was Miss Venezuela 1976\\". Another difference is the choice of words used to describe the event when she became Miss Venezuela. The first sentence uses the word \\"crowning,\\" while the second sentence uses \\"coronation.\\" While both words refer to the same event - the moment she officially became Miss Venezuela - they have slightly different nuances. \\"Crowning\\" emphasizes the act of placing the crown on her head, while \\"coronation\\" refers to the entire ceremony of becoming Miss Venezuela. However, these nuances do not alter the overall meaning of each sentence. In summary, although there are some differences in wording and structure between the two sentences, they both convey the same essential information about Peraza being Miss Venezuela 1976 and her eventual resignation due to marriage. Therefore, the answer is 2). Yes, they have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"Boiler rooms are often dirty and steamy,but this one is clean and cool.Fox Point is a very new 47unit living building in South Bronx,one of the city's poorest areas.Twothirds of the people living there are formerly   homeless people,whose rent is paid by the government.The rest are lowincome families.The boiler room has special equipment,which produces energy for electricity and heat.It reuses heat that would otherwise be lost to the air,reducing carbon emissions while also cutting costs.

(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo provided the perfect riposte to FIFA president Sepp Blatter after scoring a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 7-3 on a night when Gareth Bale grabbed his first goals at the Bernabeu.  Days after Blatter had made a bizarre impersonation of the Portuguese while saying the star spent \\"a lot of money at the hairdressers\\", the 28-year-old scored his third career hat-trick against Sevilla to go top of the scoring charts in Spain with 11 goals.  He celebrated his first goal from the penalty spot with a military salute in a mocking response to Blatter's description of him as a \\"commander\\" last week.  The absorbing victory also allowed Real to put Saturday's defeat by Barcelona behind them, not just because of the three points but also because Bale, the most expensive footballer in history, began to repay some of his fee.  Making his first start as a home player at the legendary Bernabeu, the Welshman scored twice, made another two and also managed to complete his first 90 minutes in his seventh appearance for Madrid.  Despite Bale's largely anonymous display at Camp Nou, which was blamed on a lack of match practice, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti was wholly vindicated by his decision to keep faith in the 24-year-old, who curled home a fine opener before a free-kick was deflected in as he handed Real a 2-0 lead.

Movie plot title: UchÅ« Senkan Yamato: Fukkatsu hen Movie plot: The film opens as the Earth Flagship \\"Blue Noah\\" leads the first Emigration Fleet to Amare. Suddenly, thousands of unidentified ships appear and open fire. The Earth fleet's (EDF) warships counterattack, but are quickly overwhelmed. Blue Noah is damaged critically. On one of the failing support ships, Captain Yuki Mori Kodai, wife of the protagonist Susumu Kodai, orders her ship to do an emergency warp, but for some reason, she vanishes mysteriously after the warp. Thirty-eight-year-old Susumu Kodai, having quit the EDF sometime after Final Yamato, becomes captain of the cargo vessel \\"Yuki\\". He picks up the distress signal from the crippled Blue Noah and quickly arrives at the wreck with a boarding party. Without warning, three ships of the enemy fleet arrive. With Kodai at the helm, Blue Noah has just enough power to cover a small distance and fire one shot. Kodai's precise timing and maneuvering destroys all three ships. Later, at the Headquarters of the EDF, Commander Sanada discusses with Kodai about the approaching black hole. Kodai also learns that his wife became lost in the battle. Sanada wants Kodai to lead the Third Emigration Fleet, saying he should follow his wife's example of volunteering. Kodai returns home, and is met by his bitter daughter, Miyuki, who blames him for the supposed death of his wife. The two barely speak, and before Kodai can attempt to talk with her, he is called back to HQ with news about the second fleet being destroyed by three different fleets, not including the enemy fleet earlier.

Q:Process:  - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person's has diabetes happens, how will it affect owls have better eyesight.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests a change or disturbance in the circumstances that directly or indirectly affects the system. In this case, the hypothesis suggests that if a person has diabetes, it could potentially affect the owl's eyesight. However, it seems unlikely that such a connection exists, considering that a person's health condition is not generally associated with an owl's physical capabilities. To analyze the potential impact of this perturbation on the process, let's examine each step of the process involving an owl hunting for prey: 1. The owl leaves his nest: A person having diabetes would seemingly have no impact on the owl's decision to leave its nest. 2. The owl flies out into the night: The ability to fly at night is a part of an owl's natural adaptation. A person's diabetes would not have any direct or indirect influence on the owl's flying ability. 3. The owl looks down at the ground: An owl's ability to look down at the ground and search for its prey remains unaffected by a person's diabetes. 4. The owl's keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark: Owls have specialized eyesight, which enables them to see better in low light conditions. This trait is not influenced by the health condition of any human, including a person with diabetes. 5. The owl's sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey: Owls have an excellent sense of hearing, which also helps them locate prey in the dark. A person's diabetes would not affect the owl's hearing ability. 6. The owl swoops down: The owl swoops down to catch its prey based on its natural instincts and abilities. These abilities are not affected by a person's diabetes. 7. The owl catches a mouse in his talons: This final step of the hunting process is also a part of the owl's natural behavior and is not influenced by a person's health condition, including diabetes. In summary, the supposed perturbation of a person having diabetes does not seem to have any direct or indirect effect on the process involving an owl hunting for prey. The owl's eyesight, hearing, and other abilities are intrinsic to the owl's physiology and are unrelated to human health conditions. Therefore, this particular perturbation hypothesis does not appear to hold any validity in terms of impacting the given process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Bob's parents were in their early 60's. He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood.  Which parent had fewer plaques that could potentially block blood flow?  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Mary, Bob's mom, likely had fewer plaques that could potentially block blood flow, as she had normal cholesterol levels in her blood. Cholesterol has a crucial role to play in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and other substances on the walls of the arteries. This accumulation results in the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block blood flow through the affected blood vessels. Dan, on the other hand, had very high cholesterol levels, putting him at an increased risk of forming plaques in his arteries and thus, potentially obstructing blood flow. High cholesterol levels are a significant risk factor for heart disease and can lead to elevated blood pressure and a reduced supply of oxygen to the heart muscle. In cases of complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart, a heart attack can occur. This event can cause substantial damage to the heart due to oxygen deprivation and may even lead to death in severe cases. Understanding the role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis helps to explain why individuals with high cholesterol are at an increased risk of heart disease. In Bob's parents' case, Mary is relatively safer, given her normal cholesterol levels. Nonetheless, it is essential for both individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle, routinely monitor their health, and follow any preventive measures or treatments recommended by their healthcare providers to minimize the risk of developing heart-related issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it does not provide enough information to conclude if the USAC Road Racing Championship was or is only popular in the United States.  One could argue that since it was a sports car racing series held in the United States and organized by a national entity (the United States Auto Club), it might have garnered most of its popularity in the US. However, this argument does not provide definitive proof of the hypothesis being true.  The popularity of an event or a series might not necessarily be restricted to its geographical location or the place of origin. In the world of sports, often times events that take place in one country are enjoyed by fans and enthusiasts of that sport in other parts of the world as well. For instance, Formula 1 races held in various countries are followed by fans from all around the globe. To determine the truth of this hypothesis, one would need to evaluate factors such as viewership statistics, attendance records, media coverage, and participants' countries of origin during the period of the championship. Moreover, assessing the historical context of the USAC Road Racing Championship and comparing it with other sports car racing events of that era in terms of popularity would provide clearer evidence in support or against the hypothesis.

As the United Kingdom faced severe economic challenges and the need for a strong air defense against enemy forces grew, these funds were initiated to encourage civilians to contribute financially to the war effort. Contributions to Spitfire Funds were made by individuals, organizations, and communities, and the money raised was specifically allocated for building new Spitfires, which were essential in combating the German Luftwaffe and defending the British mainland. Spitfire Funds played a crucial role in boosting public morale and providing a sense of national unity during the war. It allowed people to feel directly involved in supporting their country's defense efforts. The funds also demonstrated the resilience and determination of the British people in the face of adversity, as they were willing to work longer shifts and contribute their hard-earned money to ensure the country's air defense remained strong. This, in turn, contributed to maintaining high levels of morale and support for leaders like Winston Churchill, as mentioned in the article. Overall, Spitfire Funds exemplify the significant and direct impact that civilian contributions had on the United Kingdom's ability to withstand and ultimately triumph during World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - \\"You Are My Friend\\" is a ballad co-written and recorded by American singer Patti LaBelle, released as the second single off her self-titled debut album, in 1978 on the Epic label. While it only reached as high as number sixty-one on the Billboard Hot-Selling Soul Singles chart upon its initial release, it has gone on to become one of the singer's signature anthems.  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.  - \\"Release (The Tension)\\" is a song recorded and released by singer Patti LaBelle as a single on the Epic label in 1980.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - Luther Ronzoni Vandross, Jr. (April 20, 1951  July 1, 2005) was an American singer, songwriter and record producer.

Answer a question about this article: The architecture and urbanism of the Classical civilizations such as the Greek and the Roman evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged. Architectural \\"style\\" developed in the form of the Classical orders. What ideals were Greek and Roman Classical architecture not based on?","output":"Greek and Roman Classical architecture were not based on religious or empirical ideals. Instead, their architectural principles largely stemmed from civic ideals that emphasized the collective and social aspects of society, promoting unity, harmony, and a sense of pride among citizens. This focus on civic ideals gave rise to new building types and contributed to the development of distinct architectural styles, particularly the Classical orders. Religious ideals, although important in both Greek and Roman cultures, were not the primary foundation for their architectural designs. While temples and sanctuaries were indeed constructed in both civilizations, they were often integrated within the urban fabric alongside civic buildings such as marketplaces, theaters, and assembly halls. Rather than adopting a solely religious focus, their architecture aimed to create well-rounded public spaces that catered to a variety of social needs and activities. In addition, empirical ideals, which emphasize the role of observation and experimentation in the development of knowledge, were not central to the Greek or Roman approach to architecture. While both civilizations had their fair share of engineers, mathematicians, and other scholars who contributed to the advancement of architectural techniques and knowledge, their designs were driven more by their civic aspirations than by scientific or practical concerns. Greek and Roman Classical architecture were characterized by the use of certain distinctive architectural elements that conveyed a sense of harmony, proportion, and beauty. In the Greek tradition, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders served as the main design templates for columns, capitals, and entablatures, while the Romans adopted these styles and added the Tuscan and Composite orders. These orders served as a framework for creating structures that exuded balance, symmetry, and elegance, values that resonated with the broader civic ideals of both civilizations. In summary, Greek and Roman Classical architecture were not based on religious or empirical ideals. Instead, their architectural achievements were primarily grounded in civic ideals that aimed to foster community engagement, promote social cohesion, and celebrate collective identity. Through their emphasis on harmonious proportions, symmetry, and aesthetic refinement, the Greeks and Romans established their own unique forms of architectural expression that would leave a lasting impact on the built environment throughout the ages."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach: In this step, the food bolus travels down the esophagus through peristaltic movements and enters the stomach through the gastroesophageal sphincter. 2. The stomach churns the food: Once inside the stomach, the muscles of the stomach wall contract and relax, mechanically breaking down the food and mixing it with gastric juices. 3. With the aid of stomach acids: Gastric juices, which mainly consist of hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen, and intrinsic factor, help break down food further. The hydrochloric acid in the stomach creates an acidic environment that aids in the activation of pepsinogen to pepsin, which then helps to break down proteins. 4. The food becomes a thick liquid: After the mechanical and chemical processes in the stomach, the partially digested food is turned into a thick, semi-liquid substance called chyme. Now that we have gone through the process, I can deduce the final step: Answer: The final step of this process is the chyme leaving the stomach and entering the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter for further digestion and nutrient absorption."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  and the situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  Answer the following question: Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","output":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. In case B, the reverse reaction is favored. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Comparing the concentration of reactants in case A and case B, we can conclude that the reactants concentration would be higher in case B than in case A because the reverse reaction is favored in case B, while the forward reaction is favored in case A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They usually provide well-defined trails, visitor centers, and educational programs that help individuals understand and appreciate the natural ecosystem better. For Billy, who wants to see a forest, a national park can provide a myriad of opportunities to observe plant and animal life, participate in guided walks, learn about forest conservation, and enjoy outdoor recreational activities such as camping, hiking, and birdwatching. Thirdly, national parks are located all over the world, and many countries have implemented systems to designate and manage such areas. This means that regardless of where Billy lives or travels, he is likely to find a national park featuring a forest reasonably close by or in other countries of interest. Additionally, national parks are intentionally preserved in their natural state, meaning that the forests within them are minimally affected by human development. This allows Billy to observe and explore a forest in its most authentic setting, providing an invaluable opportunity to connect with nature and witness the ecological balance that exists within a well-protected environment. In summary, \\"national park\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense due to the purpose of national parks, the accessibility and opportunities they offer, their widespread presence across the globe, and their commitment to preserving natural environments, such as forests. This makes national parks an ideal choice for individuals like Billy who wish to explore and experience forest ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If the length of two sides of a right angled triangle measured in inches are prime numbers, and it has two adjacent sides of 12 and 13 inches long, how long must the third side be?","output":"Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem step-by-step. 1. The Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of the squares on the two legs (adjacent sides) of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square on the hypotenuse (longest side). Formula: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the adjacent sides and c is the hypotenuse. 2. We are given that two sides of the triangle have lengths 12 and 13. One of these must be the hypotenuse since they are both adjacent sides. 3. 12 is not a prime number (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12), so it must be one of the legs (adjacent sides). So, 'a' = 12. 4. Now, we're left to determine whether 13 can be the hypotenuse or if it's the other leg. Since 13 is a prime number, it could potentially be one of the legs. 5. If 13 is the other leg 'b', we'll use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for 'c' (the hypotenuse):  12^2 + 13^2 = c^2 144 + 169 = 313 c^2 = 313 6. The square root of 313 is approximately 17.69, which is not a whole number. Since the side of a triangle has to be a whole number, then 17.69 cannot be the hypotenuse. 7. Given the contradictory result with 13 being an adjacent side, this means that the initial condition (prime adjacent sides) cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, we must assume that 13 is the hypotenuse in this right-angled triangle. 8. Now, we know that a = 12 and c = 13. We use the Pythagorean theorem again to solve for 'b': 12^2 + b^2 = 13^2 144 + b^2 = 169 9. Subtract 144 from both sides of the equation: b^2 = 25 10. Take the square root of both sides of the equation: b = 5 So, the third side of the right-angled triangle must be 5 inches long."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Greg had requested the most private booth, way in the back. Coreyville Pasta House was the oldest Italian restaurant in town. And still the best.

A:","output":"Theodor Schwann, a prominent German physiologist and one of the key founding figures of the cell theory, was born in the country of Germany. He was born on December 7, 1810, in the city of Neuss, which is located in the present-day state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  During Schwann's time, Germany was not yet unified as a single nation; it was a conglomeration of independent German-speaking states, territories, and cities, collectively called the German Confederation. The region where Schwann was born was actually part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which would later play a significant role in the unification of Germany in 1871. Theodor Schwann is best known for his groundbreaking work in cell biology, particularly for his establishment of the \\"cell theory\\" in 1839, alongside fellow scientist Matthias Schleiden. As part of this theory, Schwann posited that all living organisms, whether plant or animal, are made up of cells as the fundamental structural and functional units. Schwann's education and research took place in some of the renowned German academic institutions of his time. After completing his primary and secondary education in his hometown, he began studying medicine at the University of Bonn. He later continued his studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin and ultimately completed his medical degree in 1834 at the University of Würzburg. Throughout his scientific career, Schwann remained active in Germany's academic community, teaching and contributing to the domain of anatomy, physiology, and histology. In addition to his work on cell theory, he made significant advancements in our understanding of the digestive system, notably by discovering the enzyme pepsin in the stomach and outlining its role in digestion. To summarize, Theodor Schwann was born in Neuss, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia, within the German Confederation, which is now modern-day Germany. His contributions to cell biology and the establishment of cell theory have left a lasting impact on science, shaping our understanding of the fundamental nature of living organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Among those deeply affected were two former British servicemen, who decided they could not stand idly by as innocent people were killed. Compelled by their conscience and sense of duty, these ex-soldiers embarked on a mission to fight against ISIS alongside fighters from the US, Europe, and Kurdish forces. Taking a Stand: The graphic video of Alan Henning's murder left many feeling helpless and horrified. However, for these former servicemen, it was a call to action. \\"We could not stand by and watch innocent people being killed,\\" one of them said. The pair, aged 24 and 26, traveled to the Middle East and joined the fight against ISIS, determined to make a difference. International Coalition: The two ex-soldiers found themselves in the company of fighters from various countries, including the US and Europe, who were all united in their determination to stand up against the extremist organization. Together with the Kurds, the newly-formed cohort engaged in multiple battles against ISIS forces. Echoes of the Past: As they fought alongside their international compatriots, the ex-servicemen found themselves reminded of World War I. The term 'no man's land,' often used to describe the uninhabited strip of land between two enemy positions, frequently came up. The pair couldn't help but draw parallels between the two wars, a century apart, but sharing similar themes of camaraderie and sacrifice. A Harrowing Homecoming: Upon attempting to return home for Christmas, the former servicemen were questioned extensively at the border. The pair recounted their reasons for traveling to the Middle East to join the fight against ISIS, explaining that they were driven by their convictions and the desire to protect innocent lives. Facing New Fears: Now back in the UK, the two ex-soldiers find themselves grappling with a new set of concerns. They fear reprisals from radical elements within their own country, who might target them for having fought against ISIS. Despite these fears, the pair remains steadfast in their beliefs and their commitment to taking a stand against the extremist group. Conclusion: The enormity of ISIS' atrocities, such as Alan Henning's murder, has resonated deeply with people from all walks of life. For these two former servicemen, it proved to be a turning point – a moment that inspired them to actively join the fight against extremism. While they now face new challenges and fears, their actions serve as a testament to the power of conviction and the unwavering determination to stand up against terror, even in the face of personal risk."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

One half of a randy couple ended up in court for causing criminal damage after their bed collapsed while having sex. Adam Disney, 28, and his unknown partner also pulled down window drapes in the bedroom during the tryst following a night out in Liverpool. A court heard that instead of going to one of their houses, they were unable to contain their passions and let themselves into a bedsit that Disney used to rent. Unfortunately for Disney, he was spotted hanging out of the property’s window enjoying a post-passion cigarette. Passion: The building (centre) containing the flat where Adam Disney brought down drapes and made the bed collapse. He admitted criminal damage. The betting shop was not thought to be involved. Amorous: Adam Disney's bed collapsed when he sneaked into his old flat in Wavertree High Street, Liverpool (pictured). A court heard it was the best he and his partner could do without offending public decency. Police visited the flat in Wavertree High Street after neighbours heard 'noises', Liverpool magistrates heard. They found Disney in the empty flat - his companion had already left - and first charged him with burglary until he admitted the full story. Dan Lupton, defending, blamed 'sexual antics' and said: 'This is a curious case of the morning after the night before. 'They had been drinking and the couple were passionate in their interest to have sexual relations. 'On this occasion they were seeking to avail themselves rather quickly.

Disney, of Widney Lane, Solihull, admitted criminal damage to the double bed and curtain rail, but denied breaking the windowsill when he leaned on it. Chairman of the bench Stan Golding ordered him to pay £355, split into a £100 fine, £85 costs, £150 compensation to the owner and a £20 victim surcharge. The flat's owner had asked for £500 and claimed the lock was damaged, but Mr Lupton described the premises as a 'shabby bedsit'. He said: 'The windowsill was loose and they hadn’t done a good job of securing the curtain rail. 'This was not a posh hotel room.'","output":"In an unusual court case, Adam Disney, 28, was found guilty of causing criminal damage after his bed collapsed during a passionate encounter with an unknown partner in an old flat in Wavertree High Street, Liverpool.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

The swamp's intricate ecosystem provided a haven for the small amphibian to thrive, taking advantage of the natural protective elements existing within it. Swamps are known for their dense, muddy waters and tall vegetation, such as water lilies, cattails, and various types of grasses. This dense vegetation creates an excellent hiding place for the frog and offers protection from potential predators like birds, fish, and other reptiles. Additionally, the swamp's murkiness allows the frog to camouflage itself even further, as predators have a harder time distinguishing it from its surroundings. Furthermore, swamps are rich in biodiversity, providing a plethora of food sources for the frog. Insects like mosquitoes, flies, and dragonflies are plentiful in this environment. A diverse diet can enhance the frog's health and immunity, allowing it to avoid or combat diseases and parasites more effectively. In contrast, the pad, while initially providing some support to the frog due to its buoyancy, lacked the safety and resources that the swamp could offer. The pad's isolated nature and limited space made the frog more vulnerable to predators, as it could not rely on the swamp's natural defense mechanisms. Moreover, the pad lacked a diverse range of food sources, which made sustaining the frog's life more difficult. Not only does the swamp provide safety and sustenance, but it also serves as a breeding ground for frogs. As part of their reproductive process, frogs often return to the same swamps in which they were born to mate and lay their eggs, ensuring that their offspring will have a similarly safe and resourceful environment in which to grow and develop. It's worth noting that swamps play a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of the planet. They act as natural filters, removing pollutants and excess nutrients from water, and serve as vital carbon sinks that help combat climate change. By choosing to dwell in the swamp, the frog is not only selecting a secure and nurturing habitat for itself but also contributing to the overall health of the larger ecosystem. In summary, the frog hopped off the pad and into the swamp because the swamp provided a safer and more resourceful environment. By doing so, the frog amplified its chances of survival, reproduction, and overall well-being. Also, it's important to recognize the significant role that swamps play in supporting both individual species and the broader ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The melody of the song itself is actually based on a pre-existing Russian folk song called \\"Dorogoi dlinnoyu,\\" which can be translated to \\"By the Long Road.\\" The English lyrics were written by Gene Raskin, an American musician, and writer. Mary Hopkin, a Welsh singer, was discovered on a British television talent show called \\"Opportunity Knocks.\\" After she won the show, she was signed to Apple Records, the label owned by The Beatles. Paul McCartney, who was a member of The Beatles, took on the role of her producer for the song \\"Those Were the Days.\\" McCartney also played acoustic guitar and sang backing vocals on the recording, making it a significant collaboration between the two musicians. The song became an enormous global hit, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart, number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and achieving top positions in numerous other countries. With its nostalgic lyrics and sing-along chorus, \\"Those Were the Days\\" resonated with many listeners and became an anthem of sorts for people reflecting on the past. The song has since been covered by various artists and has entered multiple languages' popular culture. Mary Hopkin's music career continued with several hit songs in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including \\"Goodbye,\\" which was also produced by McCartney. Although her later career remained active with occasional album releases, she never quite achieved the same level of success as she did with \\"Those Were the Days.\\" In summary, Mary Hopkin sang \\"Those Were the Days,\\" a song written by Gene Raskin and based on a Russian folk tune.

The reasons for this could include the generational gap and differences in upbringing. Some examples of things that Indian children might not realize about their parents are: - The sacrifices and struggles that parents - particularly older generations - have gone through to provide their children with better opportunities and a higher quality of life. - The emotional, financial, and social pressures that parents face in Indian society to fulfill expectations in their roles as providers and caretakers. - The cultural values and traditions that parents hold dear, and their desire to pass these on to their children in a rapidly globalizing world. - The experiences of parenting that Indian parents might have gone through without access to modern parenting resources, like the internet and self-help books. 2.

The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions.

The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall.

While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

Státy ESVO musí být zahrnuty v registru Unie a v protokolu transakcí Evropské unie (EUTL). Which language is this?","output":"The language of the text \\"Státy ESVO musí být zahrnuty v registru Unie a v protokolu transakcí Evropské unie (EUTL)\\" is Czech. Step-by-step justification: 1. Firstly, I identified that the text is written using the Latin alphabet and contains diacritical marks (accented letters) that are commonly found in Central European languages such as Czech, Slovak, or Hungarian. 2. I observed the specific accents used, like the háček (ˇ) on the \\"š\\" and \\"č\\", and the acute accent (´) on \\"á\\" and \\"ý\\", which indicate that this text is more likely from a Slavic language rather than Hungarian. 3. Next, I looked at the vocabulary in the text, such as \\"Státy,\\" \\"registru,\\" \\"Unie,\\" and \\"Evropské,\\" which are Czech words. Similar words exist in Slovak, but the specific phrasing and word choices in this text better align with Czech than Slovak.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What is a place with only one telephone book that many people can use? Possible A: desk, house, at hotel, bedroom, library  Why is \\"library\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"To determine why \\"library\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense, let's examine each option step by step and analyze the suitability: 1. Desk: A desk is a piece of furniture that usually belongs to an individual rather than a public space. While it may have a telephone book, it would not typically be a place where many people can access or use it. Therefore, it's not the best answer. 2. House: A house is a private residence, and telephone books kept there are generally for personal use by the people living in the house. It's not a place where many people outside the household can access the telephone book. Hence, it's not the most suitable answer. 3. At hotel: A hotel might have a telephone book at the reception area, intended for guests to use. While it can be a place with a shared telephone book, it is less accessible to the general public and primarily serves hotel guests. It's a better option than the first two, but not the best one. 4. Bedroom: A bedroom is a private space in a residence, generally intended for one's personal use. Like the house, it's not a place where many people can access a telephone book. Therefore, it's not the right answer. 5. Library: A library is a public space that provides access to various resources, including books, for a community or group of people. Libraries are intended for public use, and they often have telephone books that patrons can consult. The library's purpose aligns with the idea of a shared telephone book accessible to many people, making it the answer that most closely matches human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Building confidence can be a gradual and rewarding process that involves self-awareness, goal-setting, and practice. The two questions you've asked are similar, but they have some differences. The first question is seeking the process or steps involved in building confidence, while the second question emphasizes the personal aspect of lacking confidence and asks for help in improving that aspect of life. Although the core issue is the same, the focus differs slightly. To build more confidence, try these steps: 1. Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses: Take some time to identify your skills, abilities, and areas where you excel. Having a clear understanding of your strengths will help you feel more confident in those areas. Similarly, recognizing your weaknesses allows you to work on improving them and, ultimately, growing your self-confidence. 2. Set achievable goals: Create realistic, attainable goals for yourself that focus on areas where you want to grow and improve. Break these goals into smaller, manageable tasks that provide a sense of accomplishment and progress. 3. Develop a positive self-image: Maintain an optimistic outlook on life and foster a positive inner dialogue. Surround yourself with people who uplift and encourage you while minimizing contact with negative influences. 4. Learn from failure: Embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Understand that it's a part of life and that each failure brings you one step closer to success. Develop resilience by bouncing back from setbacks and disappointments. 5. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and recognize that everyone has imperfections. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would show a friend or family member. 6. Take risks and face your fears: Step out of your comfort zone and take on new challenges, even if they scare you. Overcoming fears and trying new things can help build your confidence by proving to yourself that you're capable of more than you initially thought. 7. Develop assertiveness: Learn how to communicate your thoughts, feelings, and needs effectively and respectfully without being aggressive or passive-aggressive. Develop the ability to stand up for yourself and set healthy boundaries. 8. Embrace self-improvement: Commit to continuously learning and growing. Develop new skills, attend workshops, or seek out mentors who can help you expand your knowledge and abilities. 9. Exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle: Physical well-being plays a significant role in confidence. Maintain a regular exercise routine, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep to improve your energy levels and overall sense of well-being. 10. Practice, practice, practice: Building confidence takes time and effort. Continually work on applying these steps in your daily life and strive for progress rather than perfection. Remember, confidence comes from experience and learning. By following these steps and remaining committed to self-improvement, you will gradually build confidence and overcome challenges that once seemed insurmountable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","output":"The text you provided is written in Romanian. Romanian is a Romance language just like Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. It's mainly spoken in Romania and Moldova. Historically, the language's roots can be traced back to the Roman occupation of Dacia, which was situated in the region now known as Romania. The occupation goes back as far as around the year 106 AD. The Romanian language evolved from Vulgar Latin spoken by the Romans and Dacians. With about 24 million speakers worldwide, Romanian is the official language of both Romania and Moldova. Moldova officially calls its language Moldovan due to political reasons. The language also enjoys a minority status in Ukraine, Serbia, and Hungary. In other countries and regions, we also see several Romanian communities where the language is still being spoken at home.  Romanian has its unique linguistic characteristics that make it stand out among the Romance languages. It maintained a lot of the grammatical complexity from Latin, which has been lost in some other Romance languages. The language is also known for retaining a significant number of features of old Latin and also, uniquely, from old Dacian and other Balkan-area languages.  It uses a Latin alphabet with five additional letters: Ă, Â, Î, Ș, and Ț. It was originally written in the Cyrillic alphabet until the 19th century. Afterward, the transition happened due to the growing cultural influence of France and the Western world. Romanian has several dialects, but the most widespread is the Wallachian dialect, due largely to the cultural and political influence of Bucharest (Romania's capital), which is located in Wallachia.  Reading, writing, and speaking Romanian can be challenging for English speakers because of its complex grammar and unique sounds. However, knowing other Romance languages can significantly facilitate the learning process given the shared Latin roots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled.

He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.  - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period.  - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history.

It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus . The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert , inland from the ocean . Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River .

It rises in the Hazarajat country north-west of Ghazni, and flows south-west falls into the Helmand below Girishk. In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it. The Tarnak is dammed for irrigation at intervals, and in the hot season almost dries up.  - The Indus River, also called Darya-e-Sindh or Sindh River or Absn, is a major south-flowing river in South Asia.

It is the longest river of Pakistan.  - Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (abbreviated as KP; ) is one of the four provinces of Pakistan, located in the northwestern region of the country. It was formerly known as North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and commonly called \\"Sarhad\\", which in Urdu means \\"frontier.\\" Its provincial capital and largest city is Peshawar, followed by Mardan.

Then I cut open my womb' Ines emerges from her house, one of three small dwellings built of roughly made bricks that stand in a clearing of tierra colorada, the red earth common in the region, surrounded by a pine forest. A slim but sturdy woman about five feet tall, she is wearing a bright red dress and a green apron. Three young children are in attendance. Ines, 43, had her first child when she was 15. Her house has bare walls and no furniture, though there is a black-and-white television in one corner. Electricity has recently arrived in her village of Rio Talea, but water has to be brought from a well. A fat pig forages among piles of chopped wood around the outdoor stove. Inside, Ramirez pounds maize on a slab of volcanic rock to make the tortillas that form the basis of the family's diet, enlivened by salsas of tomato, chilli and onion. In this remote district, meat is a rarity. Today, as on the night Ines gave birth, there is no sign of a man around the house. \\"En el campo [in the countryside],\\" she shrugs. Gently pressed to elaborate, she replies again: \\"En el campo,\\" suggesting that the children's father is an itinerant labourer, or perhaps a wood cutter who illegally fells trees at night. Haltingly at first, Ines tells the remarkable story of how she gave birth. \\"I had seven children before Orlando,\\" she says. \\"There was no problem with the births. But the eighth baby died. My waters broke and the midwife said I needed a caesarean but I couldn't get to the hospital in time. I felt the baby struggling but then it stopped moving. \\"When I was seven months pregnant with Orlando, one night the pain began. It was terrible. I couldn't bear it. I started to panic. I knew I had to do something or this baby would die too. I knew I had to get it out somehow.\\" Her son Benito, who was then eight years old, was sent up the hill to a little shop half a mile away to buy a kitchen knife. \\"We had a knife but it wasn't that sharp.\\" In her desperation not to lose another child, Ines cut into her womb as if cutting a tortilla. \\"Blood came out of me like a fountain.\\" Pushing aside her internal organs, she rummaged around inside and pulled out her son. To her great joy, the baby cried, and appeared healthy, but Ines's ordeal was only just beginning. As mother and baby lay on the floor, Ines cut the umbilical cord before putting her organs back in place as best as she could. \\"It was all a mess,\\" she remembers. Her son, Benito, was sent off once again - this time to find a man with first-aid training. He arrived with a sewing needle and thread and attempted to stitch the wound. \\"Then he piled me into a pasajero [a rural mini-bus] and drove me to the clinic.\\" The clinic was an hour's drive away along bumpy winding roads, in the village of San Lorenzo Texmelucan. \\"A lady doctor saw me,\\" Ines continued. \\"She took one look and said, 'You've got to go to San Pedro'. They put me and the baby in the back of a pick-up truck.\\" The state hospital at San Pedro was another two-hour drive away down unpaved roads, on the main highway that links Oaxaca City to Puerto Escondido, a holiday resort on the Mexican coast. By this stage, her pain numbed only by the alcohol, Ines was near to collapse. \\"The lady doctor had phoned San Pedro and they'd sent an ambulance,\\" she says. \\"I can hardly remember the rest.\\" Four years later - Orlando is now a healthy little boy who attends nursery school every day - Dr Onorio Galvan, head of the obstetrics department in the state hospital in San Pedro, remains astonished. \\"She was my star patient,\\" he says. Switching on his computer, he plays a little clip of a small woman in a white hospital smock, carrying a baby in her arms. It is his reminder of the week - remarkably, she stayed no longer - that Ines spent in his hospital. \\"I couldn't believe it,\\" says Dr Galvan. \\"There was no sepsis in the wound, no internal bleeding. She was back on her feet in a couple of days.\\" Five days later, she was on her way back home - by bus. Today, her younger children are charging around the house. Orlando, a bright-eyed boy, breaks into a run to catch up with his brother and sister, aged 12 and 13 respectively. He falls over, gets up, dusts himself down and carries on. As for his mother, she still remembers how she brought Orlando home from hospital on that long bus journey. The bus followed a circuitous route through the hills to Ines's village. It was a 12-hour journey, so Ines didn't stay on board to its final destination. Reaching the mountains where she lives, she got off. With Orlando strapped to her back in a shawl, she walked for one and a half hours along footpaths to reach her home. \\"It was a short-cut,\\" she explains. What was this article about?","output":"This article narrates the remarkable story of Ines Ramirez, a woman from a remote village in Mexico, who performed a life-saving emergency caesarean section on herself when she was seven months pregnant with her ninth child, Orlando. Ines had already lost her eighth child due to complications and was unable to get to a hospital in time when she experienced severe pain during her pregnancy with Orlando. Driven by fear and the need to save her baby, she used a kitchen knife to cut into her womb, pulled out the baby, cut the umbilical cord, and attempted to put her organs back in place. Ines's eight-year-old son, Benito, played a crucial role in helping her. He fetched the kitchen knife and later found a man with first-aid training who helped stitch her wound. Ines was eventually taken to two different hospitals, where she received treatment for her self-inflicted injuries and underwent a proper check-up. Remarkably, she faced no sepsis or internal bleeding. The article also briefly describes Ines's living conditions in her village and her family life.

What's even better was I heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on Saturday.  Originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  This was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!  The restaurant is on the corner of Ogden and 3rd St, attached to the Mob Bar and Triple George saloon.  Right away, you notice the huge \\"Pizza Rock\\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  When you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  Everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  Because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  To the right of the hostess stand was the Pizza Takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  Pretty cool.  After the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  Super cool!  It serves as a multi purpose art.  Aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new DJ station AND serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  WOW! The bar is huge and gorgeous!  Lots of metal art accents around it.  Lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  They even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  Lots going on and it all seems to work.    When we were greeted by our server, Shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  They didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  Kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so I couldn't really complain.  Shirley was a bit flustered as I expected on day one.  She quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  I completely understand.  First day jitters are a given.  She had a GREAT personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.  For dinner, here's what we got:  Classic Caesar, normally for 10.00:  Hearts of Romaine, Homemade Caesar dressing, House Croutons and shaved pieces of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Definitely a shareable dish.  I think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  Lots of fresh ingredients, but I didn't have a few issues with this salad.  The croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  The dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  They made it with A LOT of anchovies.  Now I'm a HUGE fan of homemade Caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.  Margherita Pizza, normally for 15.00:  This pizza was a 2007 World Pizza Cup Winner in Italy!  Hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from Italy.  WOW.  San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.  The dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  The sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  Mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a Margherita, which was awesome.  The only critique was the basil.  Not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie.   Downtown Pizza, normally for 19.00:  WOW, lots going on!  Mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, Italian sausage and cherry tomatoes.  Think of it as an upgraded supreme.  With all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  WOW loved the flavor punch.  My only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  It couldn't support the amount of toppings.  It became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.    Manhattan Calzone, normally for 12.00:  Stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta and garlic.  As my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks for cheese and bread.  LOTS of CHEESE.  Omg, it was everywhere.  I personally don't think Ricotta is needed.  Maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  Holy cheese!    During this week, all menu food items are free.  Our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  Please remember to tip your servers great!  This review, I've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  Just the ambiance alone will take them far.  I will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  Next time, I'm hitting the steak and pasta hard! How would this review be described in terms of sentiment? pick from the following. 1). negative 2). positive","output":"2). positive This review is more positive than negative as the reviewer seems to be excited about the new establishment and enjoyed the overall experience.

The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - Rennweg am Katschberg is a market town in the district of Spittal an der Drau in Carinthia , Austria .  - Market town or market right is a legal term, originating in the Middle Ages, for a European settlement that has the right to host markets, distinguishing it from a village and city. A town may be correctly described as a \\"market town\\" or as having \\"market rights\\", even if it no longer holds a market, provided the legal right to do so still exists.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Bezirk Spittal an der Drau is an administrative district (\\"Bezirk\\") in the state of Carinthia, Austria.  - Spittal an der Drau is a town in the western part of the Austrian federal state of Carinthia.

So, the equation becomes: 19*s = 0 To make it easier to understand, think of this as having 19 candy bags, and you want to know how many candies are in each bag (s). But in total, there are no candies (0). That can only mean that there are no candies in any of the bags. So, the value of s is: s = 0 And that's the solution!

As the nation's first woman to hold the office, Rousseff said she has a mission to fight for more gender equality in Brazil. \\"I hope the fathers and mothers of little girls will look at them and say yes, women can.\\" Rousseff -- President Luiz Inacio da Silva's right-hand woman -- has served as his chief of staff. Previously, as energy minister, she claims to have helped turn Brazil into one of the world's leading energy giants. A left-wing guerrilla fighter during the military dictatorship rule in the 1960s, Rousseff said during a congressional hearing that she was \\"barbarically tortured\\" after she was charged with subversion by the military regime. Her opponent, Jose Serra, also suffered persecution during Brazil's military rule and was forced into exile during the 1960s. A centrist politician, he served as health minister during Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government. He recently left his job as governor of Brazil's richest state, Sao Paulo, to run for presidency.

In 60 Brazilian cities, voters used their thumbs instead of ballots on a newly launched biometric system, where voters scan their fingers to log in and vote. TSE officials said all regions, however remote, will have the ubiquitous electronic voting machine. In indigenous areas in the Amazon, these voting machines were delivered by boats and helicopters. It costs the state of Amazonas 5 million reais. (U.S. 3 million) to place the voting machines. One of the most challenging trajectories, officials said, is the one to Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, a densly-forested area in the Amazon. \\"There, our electronic machines first leave Manaus by plane,\\" said Pedro Batista, TSE Director for the Amazon. \\"It's loaded onto a helicopter, and then travels by boat before being carried on some one's back for a long walk to a remote village,\\" he said. In Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, voters faced heavy rains and threats of flooding. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article covers the victory of Brazil's first female president-elect, Dilma Rousseff, who pledged to continue her predecessor's work to combat inequality, promote human rights, and fight poverty. In her victory speech, Rousseff emphasized her mission to eradicate poverty and advance gender equality in Brazil. Having previously served as President Luiz Inacio da Silva's chief of staff and energy minister, Rousseff has experience in turning Brazil into a leading energy power. As a left-wing guerrilla fighter during the military dictatorship in the 1960s, Rousseff was tortured and charged with subversion by the regime. Her opponent, centrist politician Jose Serra, also faced persecution during Brazil's military rule and was forced into exile. The article also mentions millions of voters participating in the runoff election, with some cities employing a newly launched biometric system using fingerprints for voting. The process of delivering electronic voting machines to remote regions, particularly in the Amazon, is described as challenging yet necessary, costing millions of dollars for the state. Lastly, the article mentions heavy rains and flooding threats faced by voters in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Given the fact \\"as temperature increases , the ability of that liquid to dissolve solids will increase\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"As a liquid's temperatures get hotter\\"","output":"As a liquid's temperatures get hotter, the capacity of that liquid to dissolve solid solutes generally increases, resulting in an increased solubility for most solid substances. The increased temperature imparts more kinetic energy to the molecules, leading to a higher frequency and intensity of molecular collisions. Consequently, the interaction between the solute particles and the solvent molecules is enhanced, which in turn, leads to more effective dissolution of the solute within the liquid medium. The solubility of a substance is governed by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the nature of the solvent and solute. The dependency on temperature stems from the specific heat properties and the intermolecular forces within the solute-solvent system. As reiterated, raising the temperature increases molecular motions, causing the solute and solvent particles to intermingle more effectively. Consequently, a greater number of solute particles are surrounded by solvent particles, eventually disseminating uniformly throughout the liquid. In addition to a heightened level of solubility, hotter temperatures induce the following changes in a liquid: 1. Decreased viscosity: As the temperature increases, the liquid becomes less viscous, allowing particles to move more freely, thereby accelerating the dissolution process. 2. Variation in saturation point: The saturation point refers to the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in a fixed amount of solvent at a certain temperature. With a rise in temperature, the saturation point is augmented, allowing for the dissolution of more solute particles. 3. Expanded volume: Higher temperatures result in the dilation of the liquid, which creates more space for the solute particles to disperse within the solvent. 4. Henry's law: The solubility of gases in liquids diminishes as temperature increases. This is an exception to the general rule that solubility of solids increases at higher temperatures. The reason for this exception is that gases exhibit reduced solubility at elevated temperatures due to the increased kinetic energy of gas molecules, which allows them to escape from the liquid more easily. It is important to recognize that the relationship between temperature and solubility is not universally linear. Certain solid solutes demonstrate little to no change in solubility, even as the temperature fluctuates, while others may exhibit a decrease in solubility at higher temperatures, although this is an uncommon scenario. The exact rate at which solubility shifts with temperature varies among substances and is typically represented graphically by solubility curves. In conclusion, as a liquid's temperature gets hotter, the capacity of that liquid to dissolve solid solutes typically increases due to enhanced molecular interactions and kinetic energy. This effect is especially significant in solutions containing solid solutes, leading to an overall increase in solubility. Nonetheless, it is crucial to consider the particular solute-solvent system and the specific nature of temperature dependency, as individual substances may exhibit deviations from this general rule."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Facts:   - imdb id: 0049890    - yearsactive: 1937 - 1944 -lrb- film -rrb-    - death date: 28 october 1996      - othername: richard g. baldwin    - birth date: 9 january 1911    - name: dick baldwin    - death place: lebanon , oregon , united states    - birth place: santiam , oregon , united states    - occupation: actor   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of dick baldwin .

Process:  - Put the aluminum can into a recycle bin - The cans are transported to a facility - The cans are shredded by a machine - The cans are heated to 1400 degrees to melt them - The molten metal is poured into molds - The molds are flattened and rolled into sheets to reuse.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having more animals near the water happens, how will it affect there are more cans to be shredded.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, which involves having more animals near the water potentially leading to more aluminum cans needing to be shredded, can have indirect effects on the recycling process. First, let's analyse the recycling process outlined in the original statement: 1. Aluminum cans are placed into a recycle bin. 2. They are then transported to a recycling facility. 3. At the facility, the cans are shredded by a machine. 4. The shredded cans are heated to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit to melt them. 5. The molten aluminum is poured into molds. 6. Finally, the cooled aluminum is flattened and rolled into sheets that can be repurposed. Now, let's examine the perturbation hypothesis and its potential effects on this process. Having more animals near the water may lead to an increased presence of aluminum cans in the environment, either due to animals dragging or pushing cans towards the water or due to humans leaving more cans behind as they interact with the animals. Additionally, this increased interaction could lead to water pollution if not properly managed. As a result of this perturbation, there may be a chain of consequences that could indirectly impact the recycling process: 1. The increased presence of aluminum cans in the environment may lead to an increased awareness for recycling and, therefore, higher participation of individuals in recycling activities. People may begin to collect cans either as a means to minimize pollution or because they view the process as beneficial for the environment. 2. The higher recycle rate of aluminum cans can potentially lead to an increased demand for recycling services. Recycling facilities may become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of cans that they need to process, which would require a more efficient recycling process, an expansion of facilities, or both. 3. As more facilities are needed, or as the process is optimized, the aluminum recycling industry may experience growth and job creation. This economic impact can encourage other industries to adopt more sustainable practices as they realize the potential benefits they might receive from implementing eco-friendly measures. 4. Though indirect, this increased awareness and concern for the environment stemming from the perturbation hypothesis may lead to better waste management practices among the population. This could possibly reduce the number of aluminum cans that end up in landfills or nature. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis does not directly affect the aluminum can recycling process as described, it can lead to a chain of consequences that affect recycling participation and awareness, ultimately impacting the supply and demand of aluminum recycling services. This indirect impact can then influence the overall recycling industry as well as the behavior of the population toward waste management and sustainability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who has an old friend that is a scrawny and barely functinoal human being?  About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who has an old friend that is a scrawny and barely functional human being is Milt Manville."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The campaign asks students to run every school day. Te campaign has started since October last year and will last until April this year. Kids at primary schools have to run 1km per day. It's 1.5kms for middle school students and 2 kms for high  school and university students. And records will be set for every student. By the end of April 2009, a primary school student has to run 120kms in total/ A middle school students have to run 240kms by that time. Since the campaign started, people have had different ideas about it. Some people think it is good for students. They think the campaign can make students healthier. Some students have little exercise and the campaign can make them run. But some people don't think so. They think some schools don't have enough place for students to do running. If students have to run on the road, maybe it is not safe. They also think there are many ways to become healthier; running is not the only way. So they think the campaign is not a right decision. Why don't some people think the campaign is good? A) Because they don't think it's safe enough for a student to run such a long way every day. B) Because they don't think it's safe to make so many students run together every day. C) Because they think students are busy with their school work and have no time to run. D) Because they think there are other ways to keep healthy besides worrying about the safe problem. The answer to this question is:","output":"D) Because they think there are other ways to keep healthy besides worrying about the safe problem. Some people do not think the campaign is good because they believe there are alternative ways for students to stay healthy, instead of just focusing on running. They also express concerns about the safety of students running, particularly in areas where there might not be enough space or if they have to run on the road, which could be dangerous. Furthermore, they may think that students are already busy with their school work and may not have time to run every day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Abstract: CONTEXT Diagnostic lumbar punctures (LPs), commonly used to rule out meningitis, are associated with adverse events.     OBJECTIVE To systematically review the evidence about diagnostic LP techniques that may decrease the risk of adverse events and the evidence about test accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in adult patients with suspected bacterial meningitis.     DATA SOURCES We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (using Ovid and PubMed) from 1966 to January 2006 and EMBASE from 1980 to January 2006 without language restrictions to identify relevant studies and identified others from the bibliographies of retrieved articles.    STUDY SELECTION We included randomized trials of patients aged 18 years or older undergoing interventions to facilitate a successful diagnostic LP or to potentially reduce adverse events. Studies assessing the accuracy of biochemical analysis of the CSF for possible bacterial meningitis were also identified.     DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data. For studies of the LP technique, data on the intervention and the outcome were extracted. For studies of the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, data on the reference standard and test accuracy were extracted.     DATA SYNTHESIS We found 15 randomized trials. A random-effects model was used for quantitative synthesis. Five studies of 587 patients compared atraumatic needles with standard needles and found a nonsignificant decrease in the odds of headache with an atraumatic needle (absolute risk reduction [ARR], 12.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.72% to 26.2%). Reinsertion of the stylet before needle removal decreased the risk of headache (ARR, 11.3%; 95% CI, 6.50%-16.2%). The combined results from 4 studies of 717 patients showed a nonsignificant decrease in headache in patients who were mobilized after LP (ARR, 2.9%; 95% CI, -3.4 to 9.3%). Four studies on the accuracy of biochemical analysis of CSF in patients with suspected meningitis met inclusion criteria. A CSF-blood glucose ratio of 0.4 or less (likelihood ratio [LR], 18; 95% CI, 12-27]), CSF white blood cell count of 500/muL or higher (LR, 15; 95% CI, 10-22), and CSF lactate level of 31.53 mg/dL or more (> or =3.5 mmol/L; LR, 21; 95% CI, 14-32) accurately diagnosed bacterial meningitis.     CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that small-gauge, atraumatic needles may decrease the risk of headache after diagnostic LP. Reinsertion of the stylet before needle removal should occur and patients do not require bed rest after the procedure. Future research should focus on evaluating interventions to optimize the success of a diagnostic LP and to enhance training in procedural skills..

Movie title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy. Meanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert... Answer:","output":"Yes, James Leer, a student character played by Tobey Maguire in the movie \\"Wonder Boys,\\" did steal something of value from the Gaskells' house during a party. Besides shooting their dog with what initially appeared to be a replica gun, James also pilfered a highly valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia. This theft, along with the shooting of the dog, forces Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) to deal with a series of complications throughout the film. Grady finds it difficult to be honest with Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), the university chancellor with whom he is having an affair since she is pregnant with his child and pressuring him to choose between her and his estranged wife Emily. Consequently, Grady keeps the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend and allows James to tag along with him out of concern for the student's mental well-being. As the plot progresses, Grady starts to realize that many of the things James has told him about his life are untrue and likely concocted to gain Grady's sympathy. Simultaneously, Grady faces his own personal and professional challenges, including struggling to finish an exceedingly lengthy second novel, dealing with his crumbling marriage, and navigating his affair with Sara. In conclusion, yes, James Leer stole a valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia, along with discharging a firearm to kill the Gaskells' dog. This incident contributes to the film's series of events and the characters' development throughout the movie.

Given the context: Why did Jesse do this? A:","output":"Jesse's decision to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party was motivated by his desire to hit on her, which could be interpreted as an attempt to seduce or flirt with her, as indicated by (III) seduce Lee's girlfriend. There are several reasons that might have led Jesse to engage in this behavior, and it is important to understand both the social context and possible psychological motivations to fully comprehend his actions. Firstly, it's possible that Jesse was attracted to Lee's girlfriend and, perhaps, did not care about the consequences that his actions could have on his relationship with Lee or the potential harm it could cause to their relationship. In this situation, Jesse could be more focused on fulfilling his own desires and needs, rather than considering the feelings and boundaries of those around him. Secondly, Jesse could be driven by a sense of competition with Lee. Social dynamics are often complex, and people may try to assert dominance, make a statement, or seek validation by pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship. In this context, Jesse might believe that winning over, or at least flirting with, Lee's girlfriend would prove his charm and attractiveness, boosting his ego and social standing. Additionally, Jesse might be seeking excitement or thrill, as attempting to seduce someone who is in a relationship comes with its risks and challenges. This might provide an adrenaline rush or a sense of accomplishment if he is successful in his efforts. Flirting with someone \\"off-limits\\" could serve as an ego boost and increase his perceived desirability in the eyes of others. It is also important to consider the influence of alcohol or other substances that might be present at the party. These substances can influence judgment and decision-making, as well as lower inhibitions. Jesse might not have intended to engage in this behavior initially, but as the night progressed and he consumed more substances, his inhibitions could have diminished, leading him to act on his impulses. Lastly, the extent to which Jesse went to hit on Lee's girlfriend - in this case, offering her a ride home - suggests a level of premeditation. It's possible that he had been observing her at the party and planned his actions accordingly. By isolating her from the social environment, he could create a more intimate setting that would allow him to get closer to her and make advances that may not have been appropriate in a public setting. In summary, Jesse's decision to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party with the intention of hitting on her was likely a result of several factors, including personal attraction, competition, thrill-seeking, substance influence, and premeditated actions. It's essential to recognize the complexity of social interactions and the multiple motives that might have driven Jesse's behavior in this particular situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (Urdu/Punjabi: myN mHmd nwz shryf, born 25 December 1949) is a Pakistani businessman and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 2013 until he was disqualified for life from office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2017. He had previously served as the Prime Minister twice in the 90s (1990-93 and 1997-99) and the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1985 to 1990. He is Pakistan's longest-serving prime minister. Born into the upper-middle class Sharif family in Lahore, he is the son of Ittefaq and Sharif Group founder, Muhammad Sharif, and the elder-brother of three-time elected Punjab Chief Minister, Shehbaz. Sharif was born in Lahore, Punjab on 25 December 1949. The Sharif family are Punjabis of Kashmiri origin. His father, Muhammad Sharif, was an upper-middle-class businessman and industrialist whose family had emigrated from Anantnag in Kashmir for business, and eventually settled in the village of Jati Umra in Amritsar district, Punjab, at the beginning of the twentieth century. His mother's family came from Pulwama. After the movement led by Jinnah and his struggle to create Pakistan in 1947, his parents migrated from Amritsar to Lahore. His father followed the teachings of the Ahl-i Hadith. His family owns Ittefaq Group, a multimillion-dollar steel conglomerate and Sharif Group, a conglomerate company with holdings in agriculture, transport and sugar mills.  He is married to Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif, who is also descended from a Kashmiri family. His brother Shehbaz Sharif is the incumbent Chief Minister of Punjab province, while his nephew Hamza Shahbaz Sharif is a member of the National Assembly. His daughter Maryam Nawaz is currently the chairperson for the prime minister's youth initiative. Maryam is married to politician Muhammad Safdar Awan. His other daughter, Asma Nawaz, is married to Ali Dar, son of Ishaq Dar, the current finance minister of Pakistan. The personal residence of the Sharif family, Raiwind Palace, is located in Jati Umra, Raiwind, on the outskirts of Lahore. He also has a residence in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, known as the Sharif Villa, where he lived during his years in exile. His elder son, Hussain Nawaz, is a businessman based in Saudi Arabia and currently resides in the Jeddah house. His younger son, Hassan Nawaz, is also a businessman and lives in London.  He went to Saint Anthony High School. He graduated from the Government College University (GCU) with an art and business degree and then received a law degree from the Law College of Punjab University in Lahore.  Sharif underwent heart surgery in May 2016 in London. It was his second open-heart operation. His deteriorating health forced him to undergo an open heart surgery only three days before the presentation of the country's annual budget. Many opposition leaders and the legal fraternity, including former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, raised questions about a possible constitutional crisis in Pakistan. Chaudhry called for electing a new interim Prime Minister to avoid the crisis.  Sharif started his political career during the period of nationalization policies introduced by former Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The Sharif family were financially devastated after the family steel business was nationalised, and Sharif jumped into national politics soon afterwards. In 1976 Sharif joined the Pakistan Muslim League, a conservative front rooted in the Punjab province. He initially focused on regaining control of his steel plants from the government. In May 1980 Ghulam Jilani Khan, the recently appointed Governor of the Punjab Province and a former Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), initiated a search for new urban leaders; Sharif was one of the men he found and promoted, quickly making him Finance Minister of the Punjab. In 1981, Sharif joined the Punjab Advisory Board under General Zia-ul-Haq and principally rose to public and political prominence as a staunch proponent of the military government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq during the 1980s.  He maintained close relations with Zia-ul-Haq, who soon agreed to return the steel mill which had been lost to nationalisation by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Sharif maintained an alliance with General Rahimuddin Khan, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. During his political career, Sharif also had close ties with the Director-General of ISI, Lieutenant-General (retired) Hamid Gul, who played a substantial role in the formation of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) - a conservative political alliance that supported Sharif.  Sharif invested in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab countries in the Middle East to rebuild his steel empire. According to personal accounts and his time spent with Sharif, American historian Stephen Philips Cohen states in his book Idea of Pakistan: \\"Nawaz Sharif never forgave Bhutto after his steel empire was lost into the hands of Bhutto; and even after [Bhutto's] terrible end, Sharif publicly refused to forgive the soul of Bhutto or the Pakistan Peoples Party.\\" After coming to national power in 1990, Sharif attempted to reverse Bhutto's nationalisation policies, introducing an economy based on privatisation and economic liberalisation.  Following the imposition and passing of the Resolution 660, Resolution 661, and the Resolution 665, Sharif sided with the United Nations on Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. A major international incident took place in the Middle East with Iraq invading the Kuwait which dismayed the world. Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq. The relationships continued to be strained as Pakistan seek to tighten its relations with Iran, and his foreign policy continued by Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  Sharif contended with former Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg over the 1991 Gulf War (See Operation Desert Storm). Under the direction of General Beg, Pakistan Armed Forces actively participated in the conflict and the Army Special Service Group and the Naval Special Service Group were rushed to Saudi Arabia to provide intense security to Saudi royal family. Sharif also contended the upcoming Chief of Army Staff General Asif Nawaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up).  Sharif, during his first term, found it difficult working with the PPP and the Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), a potent force in Karachi. The MQM and PPP opposed Sharif widely due to his focus on beautifying Punjab and Kashmir while neglecting Sindh. The MQM, a liberal force, also opposed Sharif's conservatism. The clash between liberalism and conservatism soon erupted forces in 1992 when political tension began to arise in which both party renegading ideological war against each other. Despite MQM had formed government with Sharif, more and more problems were mounted between Sharif and the MQM in 1992. Sharif's government members passed the resolution in the Parliament, to launch the paramilitary operation to end the cold war between PML-N and MQM. During this time, the centre left Pakistan Peoples Party remained quiet and neutral while watching the impact of the cold war between liberal and conservative forces. Prime minister Sharif also contended this upcoming operation with Chief of Army Staff General Asif Navaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up). Launched in 1992, violence erupted in Karachi and brought an economic halt in the country that dismantled Sharif's industrialisation and investment that was being brought by Sharif. Benazir Bhutto, during the course of this episode, remained silent as she too had opposed the MQM. His operation continued by Benazir also, but due to amid pressure exerted by her brother Murtaza Bhutto, the operation came to halt. The period of 1992-1994 is considered the bloodiest years in the history of the city, with many went missing.  During his second term, Altaf Hussain decided to join with Sharif and tried to reach a compromise. Soon after the 1997 parliamentary elections, MQM joined with Sharif but this alliance fall apart following the assassination of Hakim Said. Therefore, the Prime minister kicked the MQM out of the government on immediate effect and assumed the control of Karachi. MQM was forced to continued its political activities underground. This action led Sharif to claim the exclusive mandate of entire Pakistan, and for the first time in his political career, Sharif and his party had the control of Sindh, Balochistan, Northwest Frontier, Kashmir and the Punjab Provinces.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the aria Puccini considered eliminating because it held up the action?  In the second act of Tosca, according to Newman, Puccini rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the \\"torture\\" motif—an \\"ideogram of suffering\\", according to Budden—is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, \\"[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action\\". The cantata is most likely the Cantata a Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.Osborne describes the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief \\"Vittoria! Vittoria!\\" on the news of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria \\"Già, mi dicon venal\\" (\\"Yes, they say I am venal\\") is closely followed by Tosca's \\"Vissi d'arte\\". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it \\"a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously\\". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous \\"E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!\\" (\\"All Rome trembled before him\\"), sung on a middle C♯ monotone  (sometimes spoken), the music gradually...

Answer:","output":"Nachum Dov Brayer was crowned Boyaner Rebbe on the holiday commemorating the rededication of the Second Holy Temple in Jerusalem. This significant event is celebrated during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, which takes place for eight days usually in the month of December. The historic event of the rededication of the Temple came after the Maccabees, a small group of Jewish rebels led by Judah Maccabee, managed to rise against the oppressive rule of the Seleucid Empire. According to the Talmud, when the Maccabees reclaimed the Holy Temple, they found only one container of pure olive oil for the menorah (candelabrum), which was expected to last just one day. However, miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days, giving the people enough time to replenish the supply of oil and reconnect with their faith. Hanukkah is commemorated by performing a variety of rituals and traditions such as lighting the menorah, reciting special prayers and blessings, spinning the dreidel, preparing and consuming foods fried in oil – most notably latkes (potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (jelly-filled doughnuts), and spending time with family and friends. Nachum Dov Brayer is a Hasidic rabbi who became the Boyaner Rebbe in 1984. As the leader of the Boyaner Hasidic dynasty, he is responsible for providing spiritual and communal guidance to his followers. The Boyaner Hasidic dynasty originates from the town of Boiany in Ukraine and was established by Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman in the mid-19th century, son of the first Ruzhiner Rebbe, Rabbi Yisrael Friedman. Boyaner Hasidim are known for their unique customs, emotional intensity in prayers, and strong emphasis on education and communal support. The crowning of Nachum Dov Brayer as Boyaner Rebbe on the commemorative holiday of Hanukkah highlights the significance of spiritual leaders who uphold Jewish values, maintain religious traditions, and pass them on to the next generations. Additionally, it accentuates the importance of unity, faith, and resilience in the face of adversity – key themes central to the story of the Maccabees and the rededication of the Second Holy Temple in Jerusalem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Slide the log down the carriage until one end is flush with the blade. Cut the log in half lengthwise, then turn the saw off. To maximize the amount of lumber you get from the log, you can now cut several wide boards from the bottom of one of the halves you just cut. Once you’ve cut the log in half, line one of the halves up along the blade. You will need to stand it up on its edge. Turn the saw back on and cut the half into 2 equal parts. Turn the saw off and remove these parts. If you haven’t cut boards from the other half already, place the remaining half log back in the saw carriage, turn the saw on, and cut this log into 2 equal parts. Always double-check that the saw is turned off when removing cut logs from the carriage to minimize your risk of injury. Place a quartered section on the saw carriage. Orient the saw blade near the open face so that you can cut a board off of it of a predetermined thickness. Turn the saw on and saw off a board. For example, if you want boards that are 1 in (2.5 cm) thick, align the blade 1 in (2.5 cm) away from one side of the log. Slide the quarter back under the blade so that the blade is positioned to cut a board of the same thickness as the first, and then saw off another board.  Repeat this last step until you have cut the log into as many boards as possible. Remember to turn the log 90° before sawing off each board. Use your quarter-sawn boards to build beautiful wood products! For example, you might build a cabinet or table, use long boards for flooring, or create small objects like boxes or cutting boards. Place 2 quarters next to each other. Then slide each quarter under the blade and cut the 2 quarters at the same time. Remove the 2 resulting boards. Pull the 2 quarters apart and rotate each quarter 90°. Place the quarters back under the blade, then cut another 2 boards. Repeat this process until you have cut all of the boards you can from the quarters. Freshly sawn wood typically has quite a bit of moisture in it, so your boards will need to be dried before you can use them. Find a storage spot outdoors where you can stack your boards away from trees (which can drop leaf litter and twigs) or soggy soil. To create the best air flow, elevate your boards on cinder blocks and line them up side by side.  If you have a lot of boards, stack them in layers separated by thin wooden slats, then weigh the whole stack down with more cinder blocks. Look for a spot where prevailing winds will blow through the side of the stack of lumber. Use a moisture meter to check the moisture content of the wood periodically. The goal is to achieve a moisture level of around 15-20%. Depending on the weather conditions and the original moisture content of the boards, it may take several months for the lumber to dry.

It is set in 91 BCE, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius Orator, the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common. This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome.  - Lucius Licinius Crassus ( 140 BC -- 91 BC ) was a Roman consul . He was considered the greatest Roman orator of his day , by his pupil Cicero . He became consul in 95 BC. During his consulship a law was passed ( the lex Licinia Mucia ) requiring all but citizens to leave Rome , an edict which provoked the Social War . In 92 BC he was elected censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus . Licinius Crassus was married to Mucia Tertia , younger daughter of the Consul Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur by his wife Laelia , daughter of Gaius Laelius Sapiens . They had two surviving children : Licinia Crassa Prima or Major married to the Praetor of 93 BC , Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica , the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and descendant of Scipio Africanus and Scipio Nasica , and by whom she had issue Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor , who married Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius , eventually Pontifex Maximus who adopted Licinia Crassa Major 's son , who then became known as Metellus Scipio . According to both Plutarch and Cicero , a Licinia , daughter of this man , was married to Gaius Marius the Younger . The marriage may have taken place around 95 BC , though the date is pure supposition by scholars , based on the known political alliance between the two fathers ( Crassus and Gaius Marius ) , the fact that men could not marry before they turned 14 , but that leading families tended to marry early to cement alliances . Nothing is known of Licinia after Marius the Younger 's death in 82 BC , although in the time of Caesar Amatius , a Pseudo-Marius , appeared in Rome claiming to be their son - Cicero seems to have accepted the possibility that he might indeed be a Marius , though he tried not to involve himself in a politically difficult situation . He is also noted by Cicero in De Oratore that Licinius Crassus was a friend of Marcus Vigellius .  - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC  7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.  - Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (c. 138 BC  78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro.

The early to mid-1960s are regarded as Toussaint's most creatively successful period. Notable examples of his work are Jessie Hill's \\"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\\" (written by Hill and arranged and produced by Toussaint), Ernie K-Doe's \\"Mother-in-Law\\", and Chris Kenner's \\"I Like It Like That\\".

Redding's version of the song was also recorded by the Rolling Stones on their second album. In 1964, \\"A Certain Girl\\" (originally by Ernie K-Doe) was the B-side of the first single release by the Yardbirds. The song was released again in 1980 by Warren Zevon, as the single from the album Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School it reached 57 on Billboard's Hot 100. Mary Weiss, former lead singer of The Shangri-Las, released it as \\"A Certain Guy\\" in 2007.

It significantly affected the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies and caused immense economic hardships for the regions. The primary focus of the Dust Bowl phenomena was in the Great Plains region. This area spans over a vast expanse of land, covering portions of multiple states in the United States and some parts of Canada.  The Dust Bowl primarily occurred in the following states: 1. Texas: In the panhandle and rolling plains regions found in the north and northwest part of the state. 2. Oklahoma: Particularly in the western half and the Oklahoma Panhandle. 3. Kansas: Primarily in the western third of the state, including areas like Garden City, Liberal, and Hutchinson. 4. Colorado: The southeastern corner of Colorado, including towns such as Lamar, Springfield, and Holly. 5. New Mexico: The northeastern part of the state, specifically in the area known as the High Plains. 6. Nebraska: The southern portion, which included towns such as McCook and Imperial. Additional areas affected to a lesser extent are parts of South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana in the United States, as well as the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Several factors contributed to the Dust Bowl, including a decade-long drought, poor agricultural practices, and economic depression during the 1930s. Following the expansion of agriculture in the Great Plains region during the early 20th century, farmers inadvertently eliminated much of the natural grasses that anchored the soil and protected it against wind erosion. In combination with a significant drop in rainfall, this led to severe dust storms that caused devastating damage to farmland, human health, and the economy. The impact of the Dust Bowl was felt on an extensive scale, prompting hundreds of thousands of individuals and families to abandon their homes and farms in search of better prospects elsewhere. This mass exodus, known as the Dust Bowl migration, led many to California and other western states, fundamentally altering the demographics and culture of those regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choices:  - pinworm sounds  - whooping sounds  - choanocyte sounds  - korotkoff sounds  A: A:","output":"The correct choice is Korotkoff sounds.  Turbulent sounds, at the onset of blood flow when the cuff pressure becomes sufficiently small, are called Korotkoff sounds. These sounds are observed and measured during the auscultatory method of determining blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer.  The auscultatory method involves a healthcare professional placing the stethoscope's diaphragm over the brachial artery in the patient's arm. They then inflate the sphygmomanometer's cuff until it compresses the artery and cuts off blood flow. Following this, the healthcare professional gradually releases the cuff pressure while listening for the Korotkoff sounds using the stethoscope. Korotkoff sounds consist of five different phases: 1. Phase One: The first appearance of faint, repetitive, clear tapping sounds (systolic blood pressure). As the blood flow starts to return through the compressed artery, it causes the wiry pulse to produce these sound waves. 2. Phase Two: Described as soft, murmur-like sounds or a \\"whooshing\\" noise, occurring as the blood flow gradually increases, and the artery is still partially compressed. 3. Phase Three: The sounds become crisper, louder, and have a more distinct thumping quality as the cuff pressure continues to decrease, and the blood flow becomes less restricted. 4. Phase Four: Characterized by the sound becoming muffled and cushion-like (diastolic blood pressure in children). This occurs when the arterial walls no longer generate a pulse wave due to almost no cuff pressure being present. 5. Phase Five: The complete disappearance of sound (diastolic blood pressure in adults). This signifies when the cuff pressure is fully released, and the blood flow returns to normal without any restrictions or turbulence. It is important to note that the other choices mentioned - pinworm sounds, whooping sounds, and choanocyte sounds - do not have any relation to blood pressure measurement or the sounds produced during this process. Pinworms are intestinal parasites that cause itching around the anus; whooping sounds are often associated with pertussis, or whooping cough, a respiratory infection; and choanocytes are specialized cells found in sponges, a type of marine organism. None of these options accurately describe the turbulent blood flow sounds heard when measuring blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: – Vikings star Adrian Peterson entered a no contest plea Tuesday, admitting no guilt, to a child injury charge, largely dispensing with the criminal case that eviscerated his football season and still threatens his NFL future.      Peterson has been mostly out of sight since a Montgomery County, Texas, grand jury indicted him in September on a single felony charge of injury to a child. He entered the no contest plea to a misdemeanor count of recklessly injuring his 4-year-old son last May while the Minnesota boy was visiting him at his home in a northern Houston suburb.      The 29-year-old running back smiled briefly as he stepped onto the courthouse steps after his plea in front of Judge Kelly Case, then turned somber. At the media microphones, he said, “I love my son more than any of you can imagine.”      His plea didn’t instantaneously resolve his status with the NFL and the Vikings. Through spokesman Brian McCarthy, the league issued a statement saying it is reviewing the court record, but had no timetable for determining Peterson’s playing future. Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman said he would talk about Peterson when “it’s appropriate to speak.”      Neither Peterson nor his attorney Rusty Hardin answered questions, but Peterson signed a few autographs for well-wishers as he made his way through the throng to a black Cadillac Escalade awaiting him and his small entourage of family members. Peterson has maintained that he was disciplining his son in the same physical manner he was raised, not criminally harming the child.      As a condition of his plea, Peterson will pay a 4,000 fine. He must perform 80 hours of community service, half of which will be in the form of a public service announcement. He is expected to take parenting classes.      He also remains under court supervision for two years, meaning he has to meet monthly with a probation officer and face random drug tests. Before an earlier drug test, Peterson admitted to having smoked a little marijuana. District Attorney Brett Ligon said that issue “goes away” with Peterson’s plea.      The running back also is free to travel to Minnesota.      If, however, Peterson is arrested in the coming two years, Ligon said the plea deal will be revoked and he will be prosecuted on the felony charge. Peterson “has a long way to go,” Ligon said.      Hardin: ‘A very good man’      The plea went down calmly and quietly in front of Case, taking less than 10 minutes. Spectators jammed into the back of the long courtroom couldn’t hear most of what was said up at the bench by the lawyers, the judge and Peterson.      The running back spoke softly, his arms at his sides.      In his remarks afterward on the courthouse steps, Ligon brought up the mother of Peterson’s child, saying she is “doing an excellent job” of raising the boy as a single parent, that she approves of the plea deal and that she wants her son to resume contact with his father.      For Ligon, the case wasn’t about sending Peterson to jail, but making him a better parent. Ligon said he hopes Peterson will do better, that he “never ducked what the incident was” and had taken responsibility.      Hardin called his client a “very good man” and a “very good father” who “wants to prove it” to society.      “Adrian wants to get on with his life and his relationship with his son,” Hardin said.      A tough case for fans, too      The ugly charge against Peterson proved a difficult one to confront for Minnesota fans accustomed to the running back’s spectacular talent on the field and fan-friendly, upbeat public persona off it. His comeback a couple of years ago from major knee surgery enhanced his stratospheric reputation for physical ability and resilience. ||||| CONROE, Texas (AP) — Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson avoided jail time on Tuesday in a plea agreement reached with prosecutors to resolve his child abuse case.

A judge presiding over Adrian... (Associated Press)      Peterson was indicted in September on a felony charge of injury to a child for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier this year in suburban Houston. The All-Pro running back says he never intended to harm his son and was disciplining him in the same way he had been as a child growing up in East Texas.      The boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and on one of his testicles, according to court records.      The case revived a debate about corporal punishment, which is on the decline in the U.S. but still widely practiced in homes and schools.      Under the agreement approved by Montgomery County state District Judge Kelly Case and announced during a scheduled court hearing, Peterson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault.      If convicted of felony child abuse, he could have faced up to two years in prison and a 10,000 fine.      A tentative trial date of Dec. 1 had been set in Peterson's case.      Peterson has been on paid leave from the Vikings under a special exemption from the NFL commissioner to take care of his legal problems. It was not immediately clear how the plea deal would affect his playing status.      Last month, a visiting judge denied a request by prosecutors to remove Case as judge in the case. Prosecutors had accused Case of being biased against them and wanted a new judge appointed.      The plea deal made moot a pending motion by prosecutors to revoke Peterson's 15,000 bond for alleged marijuana use.      Corporal punishment is legal in every state. The Texas Attorney General's Office notes that belts and brushes \\"are accepted by many as legitimate disciplinary 'tools,'\\" but \\"electrical or phone cords, boards, yardsticks, ropes, shoes, and wires are likely to be considered instruments of abuse.\\"      Texas law says the use of non-deadly force against someone younger than 18 is justified if a parent or guardian \\"reasonably believes the force is necessary to discipline the child or to safeguard or promote his welfare.\\"      ___      Follow Juan A.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? We went here for lunch the other day.  It was busy, and seemed like a lot of business people came here for lunch. I took that as a good sign, since they chose to come to Portofino's over several good options pretty close by.  Unfortunately, I don't agree with their choice.  Our waiter was friendly enough, kind of a low talker, but otherwise the service was fine. We had the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for an appetizer.  It was good, though I would have real issues with a restaurant that could mess THAT up.  For lunch, I ordered the Ravioli special, my husband had a chicken parmesan sub and my mom-in-law had a salad with salmon and their house dressing.    My meal bordered on gross.  It looked like they had taken all of the different ravioli left over from dinner the night before, put them on a plate, then smothered them in a creamy basil sauce with way too many olives and roasted red peppers, so that they were unrecognizable.  There was way too much going on on that plate.  I like all of the things separately, but together, none of the flavors were distinguishable when it was all together.  There were heart-shaped mushroom ravioli, huge round meat-pie ravioli, smaller round cheese ravioli, and square sausage ravioli.  Doesn't that sound like whatever they had left over was what went on the plate?  The sauce was really gross looking: vomit-like in color and texture.    The salad looked fresh, and got reviews of \\"good.\\"  Jim's sandwich was good as well, though he said he would get something else next time.  The table next to us ordered pizza, which looked good.  I'll probably try that if we go back.  The other thing about Portofino's that I didn't like, was the noise level.  Normally in a restaurant, even a busy one, I can concentrate on our conversation and not hear others (unless I was trying :) ).

There are no dance schools in Glenwood and Lauryn says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance. The next night, Brenda finds herself short of dancers. Russ asks Lauryn to dance, after having seen her graceful performance the previous night. Lauryn reluctantly agrees, and goes on stage. At first, new to the sexy routine, Lauryn looks foolish, but when Russ starts playing hip-hop music, Lauryn does a sexy hip-hop routine, and finds herself to be Ruby's new star.

News article: Stolen cell phone racks up 500,000 bill in 24-hours updated 1:52 PM EDT, Wed September 17, 2014 A stolen phone was used to rack up more than 500,000 charges with calls to Somalia. (CNN) -- Think your vacation cell phone bill is high? Then spare a thought for the Australian hit with more than 500,000 in charges for calls made when his device was stolen in Europe. The whopping figure came to light in a recent report by Australia's telecoms ombudsman, who received a complaint about the bill after the customer's phone provider insisted he pay it -- even though he'd reported the theft. Astonishingly, the calls -- including several to Somalia -- were made within a single 24-hour period, a fact that'll do little to reduce concerns about the high cost of roaming charges both in Australia and the rest of the world. The complaint about the bill was made by a man identified as \\"David\\" whose son had his phone stolen during a trip to Europe. \\"He reported the theft to local police and to his provider in Australia, but because of the time difference between the continents, the provider recorded the theft as having happened a day later than it occurred,\\" the ombudsman said in a report. \\"Back in Australia, his son's bill came to more than AUS570,000 (517,000) and listed calls to Somalia.\\" MORE: Do we need phones on planes? The story has a relatively happy ending: after the ombudsman stepped in, the phone provider eventually agreed to waive its demands. For many of us though, roaming costs remain a major pitfall of travel in an age when we're all carrying data-enabled device that, unless disabled, will rack up huge charges for overseas internet and email access. A 2011 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) identified Australia as one of the most expensive countries for data roaming charges. Of the 34 nations surveyed, Australia was the seventh most costly country of origin for average roaming charges, behind Poland, Japan, Israel, Chile, Mexico, the United States and Canada. Greece and Iceland were the cheapest. Mounting anger over the high cost of phone use abroad has led to efforts to rein in phone companies. In Europe, the European Union has placed a cap on roaming charges for customers traveling within the trading bloc. The European Parliament this year voted to scrap them altogether, pending approval from individual EU governments. ETNO, the European telecoms industry body, has complained it needs roaming revenues to maintain investment in mobile networks. Either way, it's clearly a talking point -- just as long as you're not talking on a long-distance line.

Possible answers: So people would know about the event, So people would go to the flyers, make new ones","output":"Based on the context, Remy posted flyers to advertise the event they were going to put on, primarily to inform people about the event and generate interest. There are several reasons why Remy might have chosen to do this, which are outlined below. 1. Raise Awareness: By posting flyers in various strategic locations, Remy aimed to capture the attention of their target audience and spread the word about their upcoming event. The more people who are aware of the event, the more attendees it is likely to attract. This tactic is particularly beneficial for a new event, which may not have a strong online presence or a recognizable brand. 2. Offer Accessible Information: With a flyer, potential attendees can easily find all the essential information about the event in one place, such as the date, time, venue, admission price, and any special attractions or performances. A well-designed flyer will not only be visually appealing but also provide a clear and concise overview of the event. 3. Generate Excitement: A well-executed flyer can help create a buzz around an event, particularly when appealing graphics and catchy slogans are employed. This excitement can be contagious, encouraging people to spread the word and convince others to attend too. In this way, the humble flyer can have a viral effect on potential attendees. 4. Increase Attendance: By distributing flyers throughout the local area, Remy hoped to reach a wide audience and entice them to attend the event. With a higher turnout, the event is more likely to be memorable and engaging for everyone involved. 5. Showcase Creativity: The process of designing, printing, and distributing flyers allows event organizers like Remy to express their creativity and set the tone for the upcoming event. A visually appealing flyer can help build anticipation for the event and create an image in people's minds of what they can expect on the day. 6. Create a Tangible Reminder: Unlike digital advertisements, which can be easily scrolled past and forgotten, physical flyers can be picked up and taken home by potential attendees. This means that the flyer will serve as a tangible reminder for the individual about the event, making it more likely that they will attend. To summarize, Remy posted flyers for their event to raise awareness, provide accessible information, generate excitement, increase attendance, showcase their creativity, and create a tangible reminder for their potential attendees. While digital marketing methods are becoming more popular, the traditional flyer remains a powerful tool for promoting events and attracting a large audience of engaged attendees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: One of my longest-running battles with my kids is about manners specifically,about whether it's necessary to send hand-written thank-you notes for gifts.I say yes,and my children have continued throughout their teens to write the notes.But they grumble that I'm out of step with the times. If a new BabyCenter poll is any guide,  _ .A surprisingly large number of parents still insist that their children practice such old-fashioned manners as putting pen-to-paper to say thank you,treating adults with respect and addressing adults as \\"Mr., Mrs.or Miss.\\"A majority of the 1,000 parents surveyed also said they insist at dinner that children keep napkins in their laps,ask to be excused from the table and refrain from talking with a full mouth. Among the reasons cited most often by parents,BabyCenter says,is that \\"the world is a more free-wheeling place,and they want to give their kids a stronger moral compass to guide them.\\"This thinking was affirmed by 64%of those surveyed.And 58%say they see so many badly behaved kids around them that they're determined to raise their children differently. This poses a particular challenge for parents who work outside the home and must find a sitter, nanny or other child-care provider who will insist on the manners they consider most important. Pediatrician Perri Klass wrote recently in the New York Times about her annoyance at a rude,demanding child who was among her longtime patients.Although she veiled her injunctions to the mother in euphemisms ,talking to her about \\"setting limits,\\"Dr.Klass wrote,\\"I do pass judgment on kids with bad manners and so does every pediatrician I know.\\"Rude kids make her wonder whether there is something wrong with the family,among other things,she says.\\"The whole 'manners' concept might seem a bit odd,\\"she says,\\"until you recast it as 'social skills' a hot-button child-development issue,as I wrote in a recent column.\\" Readers,what manners do you insist upon for your children? Has other kids' bad behavior led you to toughen your standards? Do the... Question: are the right persons to attend to the children while the parents work outside. Yes or no, is the answer \\"Those who focus on virtue\\"? A:","output":"In the contemporary world, there is an ongoing debate about the importance of instilling good manners and virtues, such as writing hand-written thank-you notes, in children. While some believe that these practices are old-fashioned and out of touch with the current times, others argue that they cultivate essential social skills needed for successful interpersonal interactions. According to a BabyCenter poll, a considerable number of parents are determined to enforce such manners in their children, aiming to provide them with a strong moral compass to navigate the increasingly free-wheeling world we live in. When it comes to ensuring that children are exposed to the right values while their parents work outside the home, the individuals responsible for their care, such as babysitters, nannies, or other childcare providers, need to have a clear understanding of and commitment to the morals parents deem essential. In this context, the answer to the question, \\"are the right persons to attend to the children while the parents work outside [those who focus on virtue]?\\" lies in the alignment of the caregivers' values with those of the parents. The importance of manners, or social skills, cannot be underestimated, as demonstrated in the anecdote shared by pediatrician Dr. Perri Klass. She points out that children with bad manners often receive judgment from professionals, and their behavior can even be seen as a reflection of issues within the family. By framing manners as social skills, the debate transcends old-fashioned concepts into a more relevant and pressing child-development concern. Maintaining high standards for children's behavior in response to their exposure to peers with ill-manners could contribute to a generation that values respect, empathy, and responsibility. For parents who seek to inculcate these values in their children while they work outside, the selection of caregivers that uphold them becomes crucial in reinforcing the desired virtues. To sum up, whether or not the right individuals to care for children while parents work outside are those who focus on virtue depends on the extent to which those caregivers prioritize and practice the same morals that parents consider essential. If there is alignment between the values, goals, and practices of both parents and caregivers, then the answer is \\"Yes.\\" However, it is critical to remember that open communication and a shared understanding between the parties involved leads to an environment conducive to the proper development of the child's moral compass and the desired cultivation of manners and social skills."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","output":"Regarding this point, I welcome the fact that the Commissioner believes that strengthening dialogue between legislatures is very useful and that neither she nor the Council representative oppose this consolidation of other institutions, which is largely necessary, I believe, under the Treaty of Lisbon. In this statement, the speaker is expressing their appreciation for the Commissioner's belief in the importance of enhancing communication and collaboration between various legislatures. They also acknowledge that both the Commissioner and the Council representative do not object to the strengthening and consolidation of other institutions, which is considered to be essential under the terms laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon is an international agreement signed by the European Union (EU) member countries in December 2007. It entered into force on December 1, 2009. The treaty aimed to streamline the functioning of the EU, to enhance its ability to act on the global stage, and to ensure the democratic participation of its citizens. Some of the most significant changes brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon include a more efficient decision-making process, a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the introduction of the European Citizens' Initiative. The consolidation of other institutions mentioned in the statement contributes to the EU's overall goal of promoting democratic participation and efficiency. By fostering a more in-depth dialogue between legislatures, the decision-making process is likely to be more informed, collaborative, and effective. Additionally, strengthening these institutions contributes to the EU's ability to make collective decisions and act more efficiently on the global stage. In summary, the speaker's statement demonstrates their support for the Commissioner's stance on improving dialogue between legislatures and consolidating other institutions as mandated by the Treaty of Lisbon. These actions are believed to enhance the efficiency, collaboration, and democratic participation within the European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Not only that but most teenagers are trying to learn how to be more like adults at the same time. With all of this going on, it isn’t unusual for teens to experience difficult emotions or even depression. Thus, it is important for you to consider whether your teen’s poor hygiene is a sign of something more serious. If a teen was bathing normally but has suddenly stopped, and if you have noticed other symptoms such as moodiness, changes in their school performance or social behavior, or if they have started using drugs or drinking alcohol, then it may be time to seek help from a doctor. There may be a logical reason behind why the teen isn’t showering, so you should spend some time reflecting on what those reasons might be instead of just assuming they are being lazy.  For example, there's a teen who has very long hair, maybe they aren’t showering because they don’t have time to do their hair afterward. In this case, you could purchase them a shower cap, or suggest that they take a bath on the days that they don’t want to wash their hair. Some people simply don’t need to wash their hair every day. Maybe the young person is having a hard time finding the time to shower. Many teens have a lot on their plates with school, friends, extracurricular activities, and chores. It could be that they feel they can’t find the time. If this is the case, maybe you can help them figure out a way to manage their time better, or even cut out one of their chores so they have 15 extra minutes to shower. Many times, teens rebel over little things simply to feel like they have some control over their lives. If you haven’t already done so, consider asking the teen why they don’t want to shower. Asking will hopefully help you figure out why they don’t want to shower. Additionally, it will also show your teen that you acknowledge that they are growing up and have opinions and thoughts of their own.  Hopefully, the reason they don’t want to shower will be a fairly straightforward one. For example, if the teen doesn’t like the smell of the products, then you can easily let them pick ones they do want.  On the other hand, if their reason for not showering is more philosophical (e.g. they don’t want to shower because they feel they should be natural, or something like that), then you’re going to have to do a bit more work. You’ll have to spend time educating them on the health implications of poor hygiene and hope that makes sense to them. If it comes to it, you may have to start revoking privileges. Summary:","output":"Teenage years involve significant hormonal shifts, body development, and personal growth, which can lead to difficult emotions or depression. If a teenager's hygiene habits suddenly deteriorate, it might signal a more serious issue. Observing additional symptoms like moodiness, changes in school performance, social behavior, drug use, or alcohol consumption might necessitate a consultation with a doctor. It is essential not to jump to conclusions and label the teen as lazy, but to instead consider potential reasons for their hygiene decline.  For instance, long hair might discourage showering due to time constraints, in which case offering alternatives like a shower cap or suggesting baths when hair washing is not needed can help. Another possibility is that the teenager's busy schedule, including school, friends, extracurricular activities, and chores, does not allow time for showering. In this scenario, offering time management assistance or reducing chores to create more personal time can be beneficial.  Engaging in a conversation with the teenager about their hygiene habits can demonstrate respect for their autonomy and help understand the reasons behind their choices. Providing alternative products if they dislike the smells or educating them on health implications if their reasoning is philosophical can encourage better hygiene practices. If necessary, privileges can be revoked to emphasize the importance of maintaining good hygiene."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lendl, a former world No. 1 from Czech Republic, is widely recognized as one of the greatest tennis players in the history of the sport. Having actively competed in professional tennis between 1978 to 1994, Lendl accumulated numerous accolades and achievements, cementing his legacy as a tennis icon. Ivan Lendl's illustrious career includes eight Grand Slam titles, which are distributed as follows: three French Open titles (1984, 1986, and 1987), two Australian Open titles (1989 and 1990), and three US Open titles (1985, 1986, and 1987). He also holds the unique distinction of reaching eight consecutive US Open finals between 1982 and 1989. Although he never won the Wimbledon Championship, Lendl was runner-up twice in 1986 and 1987. When Lendl began coaching Andy Murray in December 2011, the Scottish tennis star was already a top player but hadn't yet won a major tennis title. Lendl's appointment as Murray's coach marked a significant turning point in the latter's career. Through their collaboration, Lendl imparted vast experience, strategic insights, and mental strength to Murray, all of which contributed to a successful partnership. Under Lendl's guidance, Andy Murray achieved vital career milestones. In 2012, he won his first Grand Slam title by defeating Novak Djokovic in the US Open. That same year, he also claimed the Olympic gold medal, beating Roger Federer in the singles final held at Wimbledon. In 2013, Murray won the Wimbledon Championship, ending a 77-year drought for British men in the singles competition. This triumphant run at Wimbledon was followed by another in 2016. Although Lendl and Murray's coaching relationship faced interruptions, their partnership remained fruitful when they worked together. Their latest collaboration ended in 2017, with both parties deciding to go in different directions. Nevertheless, Ivan Lendl's impact on Andy Murray's career is indisputable, as his mentorship and experience were crucial drivers of the tennis player's numerous successes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The state-owned Severalmaz company handed diamonds weighing a combined 150,000 carats — or 66 pounds — to the Gokhran repository for inventory purposes, according to respected business daily Kommersant.      A file photo of rough diamonds. BAZ RATNER / Reuters, file      Citing sources close to the investigation, the paper said the same weight in diamonds was returned - but four of the biggest stones were missing and had been replaced by multiple smaller ones.      The missing diamonds reportedly including a 23-carat stone.      They were insured for a combined 500,000. That means their real market value was several million dollars, Sergei Goryainov of Rough & Polished, a diamond market analysis company, told NBC News on Thursday.      Neither Gokhran nor Severalmaz returned repeated requests for comment.      The Gokhran was created in 1920 as a storage facility for valuables confiscated by the victorious Bolsheviks from their enemies, including the Russian nobility, the tsar family and the Orthodox Church.      Today, it stores Russia's supplies of gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, pearls and amber. The size of Gokhran's stores is classified.      Despite its reputation as \\"Russia's Fort Knox,\\" the agency has fallen victim to inside jobs in the past. The first Gokhran embezzlers were executed a mere year after its founding. And in 2001, four senior employees were convicted of stealing 187 million worth of valuables from the repository. ||||| Alrosa Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world.      Four uncut diamonds have disappeared while being held at the State Precious Metals and Gems Repository (Gokhran) for sorting, Kommersant daily newspaper reported on Thursday, citing unidentified sources in the industry.      The precious stones were part of a bigger batch of diamonds submitted to Gokhran by Severalmaz mining company that extracts diamonds at a large mine in the northern Arkhangelsk region.      After being sorted by Gokhran, some of the diamonds were replaced with inferior ones while the four large ones went missing altogether. The minimum price of these diamonds was 500,000, a source familiar with the situation told Kommersant. One of the missing diamonds weighed 23 carats.      A state commission was created in order to investigate the incident.      Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world. The Russian state, together with the republic of Sakha own 43 and 25 percent of the company respectively. The vast majority of Russia's diamonds come from the republic of Sakha.      Since the 1950s, Gokhran has provided sorting and preliminary evaluation services for many diamond companies in Russia.

This article: Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, United Nations goodwill ambassador, and civil rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967).

Aside from home remedies, professional dermatological treatments such as laser therapy, chemical peels, and dermabrasion can also assist in reducing the appearance of cystic acne scars. While these professional treatments are more invasive and expensive, they can offer longer-lasting results and are typically more reliable compared to home remedies. In conclusion, the hypothesis that cystic acne scars are not that hard to alleviate is mostly valid, as numerous home remedies and professional treatments are available to reduce their appearance. However, it is essential to consider individual factors such as skin type, scar severity, and remedy effectiveness, as well as to conduct thorough research and exercise caution in choosing any home remedy treatments. The context highlights other crucial aspects, indicating that even natural remedies should be approached with caution due to potential risks and safety concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: Prevent snails in garden.","output":"Preventing snails in your garden can be a challenging task, especially since snails are determined creatures that can do significant damage to your plants. However, there are numerous methods to deter them from making a home in your garden, protect your plants, and eliminate them if they are already present. Here is a detailed outline of various strategies to prevent snails in your garden: 1. Physical barriers:    a. Copper tape: Create a barrier around the edges of your garden beds, pots or planters using copper tape. The copper reacts with the snail's slime, creating a mild electric shock that deters them from crossing the barrier.    b. Crushed eggshells or sharp gravel: Spread crushed eggshells, sharp gravel, diatomaceous earth, or similar materials around the base of plants. The sharp edges deter the snails from crawling over the barrier.    c. Raised garden beds: Build raised garden beds with slick vertical surfaces that snails find difficult to climb.    d. Snail-proof containers: For potted plants, opt for containers with smooth, slick surfaces with rolling rims that make it difficult for snails to gain access. 2. Biological control:    a. Introduce natural predators: Encourage birds, frogs, and ground beetles to your garden by providing them with shelter, water, and food sources. These predators can help control the snail population.    b. Nematodes: Use natural, non-toxic nematodes as a biological control agent to target snail eggs and juvenile snails. These microscopic worms can be watered on garden soil to help control the population of snails. 3. Trap and remove:    a. Beer traps: Bury shallow containers filled with beer or a fermented mix of sugar, water, and yeast in the soil, with the lip at soil level. Snails are attracted to the smell and will crawl in, where they will drown.    b. Trapping boards: Place flat boards or tiles on the ground near plants that are under attack. Snails will gather beneath the boards during the day, making it easy for you to collect and dispose of them.    c. Hand-picking: Go out in the early morning or evening with a flashlight to hand-pick snails from your plants and the garden. Dispose of them by placing them in a bucket of soapy water or relocating them far away from your garden. 4. Chemical deterrents:    a. Organic pellets: Use organic snail pellets, made from iron phosphate, that are safe to use around children, pets, and wildlife. These pellets break down into natural compounds that won't harm your plants or the environment.    b. Natural repellents: Apply homemade repellents made from garlic, hot pepper, or coffee grounds around the base of your plants to deter snails. 5. Cultural control:    a. Remove hiding places: Keep your garden clean and tidy by removing debris, piles of leaves, overgrown weeds, and other hiding spots for snails.    b. Watering habits: Water your garden early in the day to allow plants to dry out before nightfall. Snails are more active during wet conditions and in the evening, so minimizing their preferred environment can help keep them away.    c. Plant snail-resistant varieties: Choose plants that are less attractive to snails, such as those with strong smells, tough or hairy leaves, or that are toxic to snails. Examples include lavender, rosemary, and marigolds.    d. Crop rotation: Alternate planting locations of various plant groups to help minimize the buildup of snail populations that are attracted to specific plants. By utilizing a combination of these strategies, you can effectively prevent snails from invading your garden and ensure the health and productivity of your plants. Remember, a multi-pronged approach is often the most successful, so don't be afraid to use several of these methods in conjunction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Family and friends of the Indiana aid worker beheaded by ISIS extremists were joined by politicians and prominent figures in the Muslim community at a memorial service Sunday. Abdul-Rahman Kassig, the former Army Ranger who was 26 at the time of his death, was remembered for his commitment to aid work at Butler University two days after his funeral services. 'We're not here because of how he passed,' said Hazem Bata, executive director Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield. Humanitarian: Abdul-Rahman Kassig, the 26-year-old former Army Ranger, was remembered for his commitment to aid work at Butler University. 'We're because of how he lived. We're here because of the type of man he chose to be. We're here because of his selflessness.' Kassig landed in the hands of ISIS extremists last year while delivering aid to Syrians caught in the crossfire of a ghastly civil war. At the time he was working as part of Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, a relief organization he founded in 2012 and which suspended operations after his kidnapping. His parents learned of his capture last year, though the information was not made public at the time. When Kassig appeared in a beheading video of a British aid worker, his parents recorded a video pleading for his release to ISIS militants. Kassig, who converted to Islam and changed his name from Peter during his time in captivity, inspired the Muslim community to come to his family's side. Memorial: After speeches by politicians and members of the Muslim community, photos remember Kassig's life were shown. Comfort: At funeral services held Friday, friends spoke to Paula, Kassig's mother, who had pleaded with ISIS extremists for the release of her son. The Indianapolis Star reports that at a funeral service Friday, Muslim leaders denounced ISIS violence, citing the Quran's prohibition of Muslims killing other Muslims. 'The question is, is this Islam? Definitely not. Does this group belong to Islam? No, it does not. Islam is a religion of love, mercy and peace,' said Syrian Imam Shaykh Muhammad Al-Yaqoubi. 'Encouraging killing is not Islamic,' added Imam Al-Yaqoubi. At Clowes Hall at Butler on Sunday, public figures who hadn't known Kassig got up to speak about his legacy. 'It's the spirit of believing things can get better. That together we can make a difference,' said Indiana senator Joe Donnelly about Kassig's commitment to humanitarian work.

Q:Information:  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - A judge presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate.  - A running mate is a person running together with another person on a joint ticket during an election. The term is most often used in reference to the person in the subordinate position (such as the vice presidential candidate running with a presidential candidate) but can also properly be used when referring to \\"both\\" candidates, such as by saying Barack Obama and Joe Biden were running mates in 2008 and 2012.  - Carlos Gustave Spaht , I ( August 2 , 1906 - April 29 , 2001 ) , was a Louisiana judge best remembered for having lost the Democratic gubernatorial runoff election in January 1952 to fellow Judge Robert F. Kennon of Minden , the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana . Spaht 's unsuccessful running mate for lieutenant governor was future Governor John J. McKeithen of Columbia , the seat of Caldwell Parish in north Louisiana . McKeithen lost to then State Senator C.E. \`\` Cap '' Barham of Ruston , the seat of Lincoln Parish , also in north Louisiana .

I heard that After being stationed in the desert for 6 months Kai saw rain for the first time.  And I was wondering How would Kai feel afterwards? Available options: [+] hot from the summer sun; [+] dehydrated from the dry air; [+] refreshed in the cool rain;","output":"Kai, who had been stationed in the desert for six months, was quite accustomed to the harsh conditions he faced daily. The relentless summer sun and the dry air made it quite a challenge for him to stay adequately hydrated and comfortable. It was clear that the environment had taken its toll on him both physically and mentally. When Kai finally experienced rain for the first time after his extended desert stay, it must have been a truly astonishing and transformative moment. The unexpected sight and feeling of rain, along with the accompanying change in the atmosphere around him, would certainly evoke a range of emotions and reactions. First and foremost, Kai would most likely have felt an overwhelming sense of refreshment from the cool rain. After being exposed to the scorching sun and dehydrated air every day, the rain's cooling effect on his skin, as well as its ability to increase the humidity in the air, would have been incredibly revitalizing. There is something intrinsically soothing and calming about the feel of water droplets on one's skin and the sound of falling rain, which would have been a welcome sensory change for Kai, who had grown used to the dry, searing conditions of the desert. This refreshing experience would have brought relief to his body and mind, allowing him to unwind and relax momentarily. In addition to the refreshment and comfort brought on by the rain, Kai might also have been reminded of how his body had been struggling to cope with the desert's harsh conditions. Despite his best efforts to stay hydrated throughout his six-month desert deployment, his body would have adapted to the dehydrated environment in some way. It's possible that, as the rain presented a more familiar and forgiving environment, Kai could have recognized the physical toll that the extremes of heat and dryness had taken on him. This awareness might have made him feel even more grateful for the reprieve the rain offered and provided him with a newfound sense of appreciation for environments less extreme than the desert. Moreover, a sudden weather change as profound as this would also likely have sparked a sense of awe in an individual like Kai. Having grown accustomed to a seemingly relentless desert climate, the rare experience of rain would have been an extraordinary event. This may have prompted feelings of wonder and amazement, reminding him of the ever-shifting and surprising nature of weather and the world's various ecosystems. In summary, experiencing rain after six months of being stationed in the desert would have been an unforgettable, multifaceted experience for Kai. The cooling, rejuvenating rain would have provided much-needed refreshment to both his body and mind after grappling daily with the dehydrating heat of the desert. The sudden appearance of the rain could have also sparked a sense of awe and wonder at nature's vast and ever-changing beauty. Finally, in light of these experiences, Kai might have gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for the importance of staying hydrated and protecting his body, as well as a more profound respect for the planet's ever-changing and unpredictable weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What's the most logical way to complete this passage? A former West Point cadet has lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against members of R&B singer Patti LaBelle's entourage whom he accused of beating him as he waited for a ride outside a Houston airport terminal. In his lawsuit, Richard King alleged he was attacked without provocation by LaBelle's bodyguard and two others while waiting outside Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2011. King had just arrived in Houston, his hometown, while on spring break from West Point. After five days of testimony and 10 hours of deliberation, a federal jury in Houston on Tuesday night absolved Zuri Edwards, LaBelle's manager and son; Efrem Holmes, her bodyguard; and Norma Harris, her hairdresser. Raley said","output":"that King's actions on the night of the altercation played a significant role in the jury's decision. According to witness statements and security footage presented during the trial, King appeared to be visibly intoxicated and was seen acting aggressively toward other individuals at the airport terminal before the incident occurred. As he waited for his ride, King allegedly shouted obscenities and slurs, provoking a tense atmosphere among the bystanders. LaBelle's defense team argued that King initiated the confrontation by approaching the singer's vehicle and attempting to open its door. They claimed that her entourage reacted out of fear for LaBelle's safety and acted in self-defense, with no intent to cause King serious harm. The defense also presented evidence demonstrating that King had a history of excessive drinking, which may have contributed to his erratic behavior on the night of the alleged attack. Moreover, the defense argued that King's conduct that evening was unbecoming of a West Point cadet and highlighted his subsequent expulsion from the prestigious military academy, which was unrelated to this incident but nevertheless resulted in a considerable loss of reputation and potential career opportunities for King. In response to the jury's decision, Raley expressed disappointment but acknowledged the diligence with which the jurors considered the evidence presented. He maintained that King had suffered lasting physical and emotional consequences from the attack, including a traumatic brain injury that forced him to leave West Point and derailed his hopes of serving his country as an officer in the U.S. Army. Despite King's loss of the multimillion-dollar lawsuit, the case has drawn attention to the potential dangers faced by celebrities and their entourages. It has also raised questions about the responsibility that both high-profile figures and their security personnel have to avoid engaging in aggressive or violent behavior, particularly when faced with tense situations involving unpredictable individuals. As this case comes to its conclusion, it highlights the complexities of navigating the legal system and the task of reaching a fair and just decision in cases where both parties present compelling arguments. Jurors were faced with the challenging task of weighing King's claims of being an innocent bystander who was brutally attacked against the defense's portrayal of him as a belligerent individual whose aggressive behavior led to the altercation. Ultimately, the jury's decision in favor of LaBelle and her entourage signals the importance of examining the full context of an incident before casting judgment. This case serves as an important reminder that public figures and their associates must remain vigilant and continue seeking constructive ways to protect their safety in the face of potentially threatening situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage. Context: Platelet-activating factor (PAF) plays a significant role in fertility. Preimplantation stage embryos produce PAF (ePAF) which is required for development. PAF's mechanism of action is receptor-mediated and its presence has been reported in the developing mouse and human embryo. Exposure of preimplantation stage mouse embryos results in higher implantation rates. However, the effect of such treatment on live-birth rates and birth weights has not been reported. Therefore, the objective the study was to determine the effect of exposing preimplantation mouse embryos to PAF on subsequent birth rate and weight.\\", 'Two-cell stage preimplantation stage mouse embryos exposed to PAF (10(-7) M) for 15 min prior to intraoviductal transfer.', 'Preimplantation stage embryos were recovered from eCG/hCG primed BDF1 female mice. Embryos were exposed to synthetic PAF (10(-7) M) for 15 min. PAF-treated embryos were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant female CD-1 female mice. Superovulated and cultured BDF1 embryos not treated with PAF served as in vitro controls and naturally ovulated embryos with no collection/culture served as in vivo controls. Embryos were permitted to develop to term (18-21 days). The number of pups born per litter and litter weights subsequently were recorded.', 'A total of 160 BDF1 mouse embryos were collected, treated, and transferred (20 per CD-1 recipient) as described. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of pups born to the PAF treatment group (56/80; 70%) as compared to the control group (44/80; 55%). There was also a significant difference (P < 0.05) in litter birth weights between the PAF (1.31 g/litter) and controls groups (1.25 g/litter). There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in birth weights between the PAF treatment group and the in vivo group (1.51 g/litter). There was a significant difference in birth weights between the in vitro-control and in vivo groups (1.51 g/litter). There were no observational malformaties to pups born in any group. Answer: Brief exposure of preimplantation stage embryos to PAF will result in a significant increase of delivery rates (pups/litter) as well as birth weights. However, the increase of birth weight was significantly below that found naturally. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism of PAF's action in the preimplantation stage embryo and subsequent uterine development. Output:","output":"Part #1: Construct a question that is unambiguous.

Usage: \\"What was the result of exposing preimplantation mouse embryos to PAF for 15 minutes?\\" The passage provides a clear and unique answer, stating that brief exposure to PAF resulted in a significant increase of delivery rates and birth weights, but the increase in birth weight was significantly below that found naturally. Part #4: Construct a question whose answer uses text phrases from the passage. Usage: \\"What was the observed birth rate and birth weight difference between the PAF treatment group and control groups?\\" The answer can be found using text phrases from the passage: \\"There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of pups born to the PAF treatment group (56/80; 70%) as compared to the control group (44/80; 55%).

OPTIONS: [A]. Yes. [B]. No. Answer:","output":"Answer: [B]. No. Stalactites are formed through the slow deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in limestone caves. Soil, sand, and clay are not directly involved in the formation of stalactites.  Soil is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and organisms that support plant life. Sand is a granular material made up of finely divided rock and mineral particles, while clay is a fine-grained, naturally occurring earthy material comprised of tiny clay minerals. Although these materials can interact with limestone or other rock types in various geologic processes, they do not significantly contribute to the formation of stalactites. Stalactite formation typically begins when water containing dissolved calcium carbonate seeps through cracks and pores in a limestone cave's ceiling. As the water evaporates, it leaves behind mineral deposits that gradually accumulate and create the distinctive icicle-like formations we call stalactites. This process can take thousands of years, with the stalactites growing at a very slow rate. In summary, although soil, sand, clay, and limestone are all important components in various geological processes, it is not accurate to say that they directly form stalactites."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Kendall would not answer the phone when she saw it was Tracy calling.  Given the context: How would Kendall feel afterwards?  Possible answers: upset, giddy, full A:","output":"Determining Kendall's emotions in this situation requires careful interpretation of the context described. Here, Kendall avoided answering the phone when she noticed it was Tracy calling. This suggests that there is some element of discomfort, disagreement, or tension in their relationship which has lead Kendall to not want to engage with Tracy. Among the given options: upset, giddy, or full, the most fitting description of Kendall's emotional state would most likely be upset. The reluctance to answer a call generally implies a negative emotional state. People usually avoid confronting or interacting with others when they are in distress or upset. Kendall could be upset for several reasons. Perhaps she had a conflict with Tracy in the past, or maybe she was troubled by Tracy's opinions or actions. It could also be the case that Kendall is dealing with her own personal issues and felt like she could not handle a conversation with Tracy at the moment. There is also the possibility that Tracy’s call could represent or bring up something upsetting for Kendall, and thus, she avoided it to protect herself from additional distress. The term 'giddy' which typically means a state of excitable joy or elation wouldn't fit this context well because, in this case, there is a clear avoidance behavior in response to Tracy's call. If Kendall were giddy, she would be eager to answer the phone and engage in conversation, contrary to what is portrayed. 'Full' predominantly refers to satiation after consuming food, which doesn't align with the emotional scenarios surrounding interactions and communications over the phone. Therefore, given the indicators provided in the context, it would be logical to infer that Kendall likely felt upset after seeing that Tracy was calling and deciding not to answer the phone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the belief that a mirror facing the bed is bad because it can steal your soul, a feng shui concept or a common belief in China? Is there any scientific reason behind positioning of bed as claimed by feng shui? Does feng shui work? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choose your answer from: *no. *yes.","output":"The belief that a mirror facing the bed is bad could be attributed to both feng shui and common beliefs in China. Feng shui is a complex system of geomancy originating in China which is based on the concept of harmonizing the flow of energy or \\"chi\\" within a given space. In feng shui, mirrors are powerful objects, known to reflect energy and having the potential to multiply whatever they reflect. It is typically advised against placing mirrors directly facing a bed, as a reflection of oneself while sleeping is said to potentially lead to poor sleep, nightmares, or even attract negative energy to the individual. This belief is also commonly found in Chinese culture. The fear that a mirror could steal one's soul when placed facing the bed may be derived from folklore and superstition. In many cultures, mirrors are believed to possess mystical and supernatural properties, often acting as portals to other realms and having the ability to capture souls. Generally, placing a mirror facing the bed is regarded as bad luck in Chinese culture. As for the scientific reasons behind the positioning of the bed as claimed by feng shui, there is no concrete evidence or scientific research that supports these claims. However, it is worth mentioning that some feng shui principles may have positive psychological effects on a person's well-being. For example, creating a calm and organized bedroom environment may contribute to better sleep and overall mental health. Nonetheless, attributing these benefits to the specific positioning of objects, based on feng shui principles, remains unproven by scientific research. The questions above address different aspects related to feng shui and cultural beliefs in China, making the questions different from each other. The first question examines the origins of a specific belief, while the second asks for scientific validation behind feng shui.

Wearing curve-hugging black workout pants and a white tank top   Kim Kardashian  perches on a couch in the media room of  her  newly renovated Bel Air estate and sips Pedialyte through a straw. The makeup-free 36-year-old appears almost normal â certainly not like a mogul who  according to Forbes  banked 45.5 million the past year from a brand she built on self-Â­aggrandizement  shameless product peddling and nude selfies. At the epicenter of this unprecedented trajectory remains E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians  a living record of her happily debauched family â Kourtney  38; Khloe  33; Rob  30; Kendall  21; and Kylie  20; as well as matriarch Kris  61  and her ex Caitlyn Jenner  67 (who in 2015 transitioned from Bruce). On Sept. 24  a 90-minute special will celebrate the series' 10th unapologetic year. It's a head-scratching milestone for a show that    at  its  conception  offered viewers little more than a voyeuristic lens into the lives of a celebrity-adjacent family â but quickly became the mother ship for all their product extensions and the platform through which Kris and her five daughters ushered in the era of the reality celebrity as a brand. Keeping Up With the Kardashians now airs in 167 countries  boasts nine spinoffs to date and has ranked as E! Entertainment's top-rated series since 2010. And while it peaked in 2011 with 10.5 million viewers over two nights for  Kim 's fairy-tale wedding to Kris Humphries (they divorced after 72 days)  it still averages north of 2.1 million every Sunday in its 13th season. In 2015  E! agreed to a reported 80 million deal to keep the family through season 14. But that's a pittance compared to the fashion and lifestyle empire they've built from one boutique in the Valley. With a combined social media reach of 700 million-plus followers and five insanely profitable apps  the family mints millions from a hodgepodge of endorsement deals  paid appearances and can't-stay-in-stock products. And it all grew from a show that opened its pilot with these prophetic words from  Kim  (already notorious for the sex tape  she  made with  her  ex  Ray J  that was made public in 2007): \\"I hate you all.\\" Kim Kardashian (star  executive producer) I was going to [Pierce College]  and after school I would go work the cash register at our store  Dash. This all happened when I was 27 â¦ Kourtney Kardashian (star  executive producer) We had talked to producers about doing a show about the three of us running the store  Dash  where Khloe and I would do the day-to-day  and  Kim  would come in as a stylist. It didn't go anywhere. Ted Harbert (then-CEO of E! Networks) Just like anybody else  I knew of the family through [O.J. Simpson attorney] Robert Kardashian. There was a bit of the stuff with  Kim  hanging around Paris Hilton and  of course  the fun with Ray J [who made a sex tape with Kim]. That was sort of world news. Damla Dogan (senior vp development & programming  E!) They were just crossing over into pop culture territory  especially  Kim .  She  had a look that wasn't on TV at the time.  She  wasn't stick thin  and that was relatable.  Kim  I don't think any of us thought it would. Khloe Kardashian (star  executive producer) I don't think we knew what we were even saying yes to. Everything was just super-fast.  Kim  and my mom were steering the ship. We were just like  \\"Tell us where to be and we'll be there.\\" Kris The watercooler chatter from the first episode was all about [9-year-old] Kylie jumping on a stripper pole.  Kim  had one installed in my bedroom and our friend Robin Anton  who is the founder of The Pussycat Dolls  was just messing around  and Kylie hops up there  twirls around a couple times  and it became this thing.  Kim  When we would travel  I remember people calling mine  Kourtney  and Khloe's names and we thought they knew us from high school or something. We just didn't get it. Then they started chasing us down at the airport. That was the first time that we were like  \\"Oh my God.\\" Khloe In Armenia  I've never seen so many people. I got separated from  Kim  and everyone  and they all got in the van and left. I was like  \\"Hello? I'm still in the fucking crowd of people!\\" Everyone forgot about me and Erin Paxton  our audio mixer  took her boom and literally fished me back into our producer's van. Kris There was barely Twitter when we started. Ryan called  Kim  and said  \\"There's this thing called Twitter you might want to pay attention to.\\" The girls [began] embracing their audience and sharing their lives.  Dow Kim  sort of paved the way for the economic structure of native influencer marketing. Before the rise of the common man YouTuber in their bedroom  you had people like  her .  She  was the one who kicked down the door and got the brands to spend money in that area because  she  showed success. Brands noticed that when when you would pay a celebrity to send out a branded tweet  they were getting more click-throughs for the dollar  so it made more monetary sense. That's why that revolution started. Dow When  Kim  did the cover of CR [in 2013]  that's when  she  was anointed.

In August 2011   Kim  married NBA player Kris Humphries. The E! special of the 6 million wedding earned the network its highest ratings to date and more than 10 million in ad revenue.  Kim  There was all this attention on the wedding  and I thought maybe it was just the pressure of the show giving me this anxiety.

Are K-Dramas addictive?","output":"The following two questions are related but not exactly the same: 1. Why is drama so addictive? 2. Are K-Dramas addictive? The first question, \\"Why is drama so addictive?\\", seeks to understand the factors that make drama in general addictive to its viewers. This question encompasses drama as a whole, including all forms, formats, and cultures. It aims to investigate the psychological, emotional, and social aspects that contribute to the addictive nature of drama. Some reasons behind the addictiveness of drama include: a. Relatability: Humans are social beings, and through drama, we connect to the experiences and emotions of different characters. The relatability of these characters helps us understand ourselves and others in various situations. b. Emotional engagement: Watching drama engages our emotions, allowing the viewer to empathize with different characters. This emotional engagement can serve as an emotional outlet for the viewer. c. Suspense and climax: Dramas often involve a buildup of tension, suspense, and anticipation, followed by a satisfying resolution. These elements can release feel-good chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins in the viewer's brain, which can contribute to the addictiveness of drama. d. Escapism: Dramas offer viewers a chance to escape from their daily lives and immerse themselves in the world of the characters and their stories, which can become quite addictive. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Are K-Dramas addictive?\\", specifically asks about the addictiveness of Korean dramas (K-Dramas) in particular. K-Dramas have gained enormous popularity worldwide due to their unique blend of storytelling, characterization, cinematography, and cultural exploration. The addictive nature of K-Dramas may be attributed to some particular factors specific to this genre, such as: a. Unique storylines: K-Dramas offer fresh, innovative storylines that are different from typical Western television dramas. These storylines often showcase Korean culture, habits, ideals, and societal issues. b. Cultural fascination: For international viewers, K-Dramas serve as a gateway to understanding and experiencing Korean culture, such as traditional customs, language, fashion, and food. This cultural fascination can make K-Dramas more addictive. c. Well-developed characters: K-Dramas often include multi-dimensional characters with complex backstories, emotions, and growth. These well-developed characters can enhance the viewers' emotional engagement and attachment, increasing the addictive nature of the dramas. d. High-quality production: K-Dramas are known for their high production values, including striking visuals, engaging soundtracks, and attention to detail. This quality enhances the viewing experience and can contribute to their addictive nature. e. Limited episode count: K-Dramas typically have a predetermined limited number of episodes, unlike some Western dramas with open-ended seasons. This structure allows for well-paced and tightly-woven storytelling, with each episode packed with meaningful content that keeps viewers coming back for more. In summary, although both questions address the addictive nature of drama, the first question delves into the broader aspects of drama in general, while the second specifically explores the addictiveness of K-Dramas. Both questions share some commonalities but also highlight distinct differences in the factors that contribute to their respective forms of drama's addictive nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County.  The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.  In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member.

Pick from: i. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases.. ii. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases.. iii. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases.. iv. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases..","output":"The statement that correctly describes a relationship between the distance from Earth and a characteristic of a star is: iii. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. To further understand this relationship, we must first discuss a concept called \\"apparent brightness\\" or \\"apparent magnitude\\". Apparent brightness is a measure of how bright a star appears to be as seen from Earth or an observer's point of view. It is not an intrinsic property of the star but rather depends on the observer's location and the distance between the star and the observer. Apparent brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the Earth and the star. This relationship is governed by the Inverse Square Law, which states that the intensity of a physical quantity (such as starlight) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity. Mathematically, this can be represented as: Apparent Brightness ∝ 1 / (Distance)² Now, let's examine the four statements provided: i. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases: This statement is incorrect because the size (or radius) of a star is an intrinsic property and does not depend on its distance from Earth. ii. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases: This statement is also incorrect for the same reason mentioned in statement i – the size of a star is an intrinsic property and does not depend on its distance from Earth. iii. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases: This statement is correct based on the Inverse Square Law. As the distance between the observer (Earth) and the star decreases, the intensity of the starlight increases, making the star appear brighter. This statement accurately describes the relationship between the distance from Earth and the apparent brightness of a star. iv. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases: This statement is incorrect because it contradicts the Inverse Square Law. When the distance between the observer (Earth) and the star increases, the intensity of the starlight decreases, making the star appear less bright. So, the correct answer is statement iii.

The Fundamental Rights Agency is an EU body aimed at promoting and protecting the fundamental rights of individuals within the European Union. With the work program outlining key priorities and strategies to be followed by the agency, it is of utmost importance that a capable director is appointed without delay. By nominating a director promptly, the agency will be better equipped to begin its crucial work, ensuring adherence to and respect for the fundamental rights within the European Union. It is essential for the credibility of the institution and effectiveness of its functioning that a skilled leader is in place to coordinate and guide the agency. A timely appointment of the director will also ensure smooth operations and uninterrupted progress on the work program initiatives. This, in turn, will allow the agency to make significant progress in addressing human rights and equality matters, fostering a more inclusive and just society for EU citizens. Moreover, the director's role extends beyond managing the agency. They must effectively represent the institution in its engagements with other EU bodies, national governments, international organizations, and civil society. An early appointment is crucial to ensure a strong voice for the agency in these dealings.

Context: During the 20th century Valencia remained the third most populous city of Spain as its population tripled, rising from 213,550 inhabitants in 1900 to 739,014 in 2000. Valencia was also third in industrial and economic development; notable milestones include urban expansion of the city in the latter 1800s, the creation of the Banco de Valencia in 1900, construction of the Central and Columbus markets, and the construction of the Gare du Nord railway station, completed in 1921. The new century was marked in Valencia with a major event, the Valencian regional exhibition of 1909 (La Exposición Regional Valenciana de 1909), which emulated the national and universal expositions held in other cities. This production was promoted by the Ateneo Mercantil de Valencia (Mercantile Athenaeum of Valencia), especially by its chairman, Tomás Trénor y Palavicino, and had the support of the Government and the Crown; it was officially inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII himself.

These very tough kids often came directly from prison to my classroom. They often wanted to escape from the group home. They were society's \\"throwaway\\" kids--youngsters without families to love and care for them. They desperately needed to receive love. Then I found one thing more important for them. So, when a friend suggested an idea, I thought it would be a great program for my students. The plan was simple. We arranged that every Wednesday morning, I'd bring over my little crew, and they were supposed to clean the runs, wash dog and cat bowls, and feed the animals at our local animal shelter. Then came the risky part of the program. After doing their chores, the youngsters would earn the freedom to walk one of the dogs in the wooded area behind the shelter, where I couldn't even see them. We began the project. Each week, I carefully went over the list of students who had met the requirements. All that week, students worked hard to control their tempers and be cooperative. I emphasized how much the animals needed their love and care. As they served the animals, the youngsters were transforming before our eyes. Never before had they been considered contributing members of society. Yet now these kids begged to volunteer at the shelter. As we had planned, my students walked the dogs, unwatched, in the woods for up to half an hour. I impressed on each of them my trust and respect that they'd bring back the animal in their care safely and on time. Remarkably, I never lost a student or an animal. The world might not have needed or might have forgotten about my kids, but the animals didn't. these shining animals showed some very needy kids the way back home from heartbreak and abuse.

Investigators seek cause of deadly Philadelphia row house fire PHILADELPHIA – Fire officials planned to return to a charred block of row homes Sunday to investigate the cause of a blaze that killed three 4-year-olds and a baby and engulfed at least 10 residences. The fire erupted early Saturday and raced from row home to row home, leaving behind only charred frames. One witness said the blaze may have begun on a couch on a porch. Twin sisters Maria and Marialla Bowah were among the dead. Their father, Pennoh Davis, told WPVI-TV that they loved to attend Sunday school. \\"My little girls, they loved to play, loved to read, loved to draw and loved to sing,\\" Davis said. The girls' mother, Dewen Bowah, told police she was home with seven children and managed to get her three other daughters out before jumping from a second-floor window. But she couldn't save the twins, 1-month-old Taj Jaque and 4-year-old Patrick Sanyeah. The boys' mother wasn't in the home at the time. \\"We lost four precious lives,\\" Mayor Michael Nutter said Saturday. \\"Four little innocent children, in a horrific tragedy. I can only pray that their pain was not long and they did not truly feel and experience the intensity of this fire and flames.\\" Bowah and her three surviving daughters were taken to the hospital, but the extent of their injuries was not known. Jeff Boone told The Philadelphia Inquirer that he saw a couch on fire on the porch of a house about five doors down from his residence and heard children screaming. The flames spread across porches so fast, he said, that \\"it looked like someone had a flamethrower and just shot it all across.\\" Boone said he called 911 and bolted out of his house to try to save his neighbors. \\"I was running, screaming, telling everybody, \`Get up! Yo, get yo! Go!\\"' he said. Milton Musa told the newspaper his roommate woke him up and said their home was on fire. Once outside, Musa said, he saw two children hanging from a neighbor's window. \\"I could see they weren't strong, and I was afraid they'd fall to the cement,\\" Musa said. \\"So I went underneath them, let them fall on my back and carried them away.\\" He wiped away tears as he recalled the intense moments as the blaze swept through the neighborhood. \\"Everyone was running for their lives,\\" he said. \\"I've lost everything. My paperwork, my documents, my house. Everything.\\" About 100 firefighters responded to the blaze.

Here is the revised and detailed process: 1. Fertilization: The fusion of a sperm cell from the male and an egg cell (ovum) from the female. This event occurs in the female's fallopian tubes (in most cases) after sexual reproduction and results in the formation of a zygote. 2. Formation of an embryo (which you mentioned as \\"Embryo is C\\"): The zygote undergoes multiple divisions and develops into a multicellular organism called an embryo. 3. Embryo grows and develops into a fetus inside the woman's womb: The embryo further develops into a fetus, during which all major body structures and organ systems form. This stage of development takes place inside the woman's uterus. 4. The fetus is born: After a gestation period of about nine months, the fetus is delivered through the birth canal as a baby during childbirth. 5. Begins to grow and develop through infancy and childhood: Human growth and development continue in various physical, cognitive, and social aspects throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence. 6. In the teenage years, the human experiences puberty: Puberty is a stage in human development when the body undergoes various hormonal and physiological changes, which result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive maturity. 7. Reaches sexual maturity: This is the stage at which individuals become capable of reproduction, marked by the onset of menstruation in females and the production of mature sperm in males. 8. At 18, the human becomes an adult: This age is generally considered a legal milestone, where the individual gains various rights and responsibilities.

However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie.

Q:Information:  - Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With an estimated 90.5 million inhabitants , it is the world's 14th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976.  - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing.  - Wu (222280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). It previously existed from 220222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei, its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, Sun Quan, declared himself 'Emperor'. Its name was derived from the place it was based in  the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as \\"Wu\\". It was referred to as \\"Eastern Wu\\" or \\"Sun Wu\\" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called \\"Eastern Wu\\" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and \\"Sun Wu\\" because the family name of its rulers was \\"Sun\\". During its existence, Wu's capital was at Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), but at times it was also at Wuchang (present-day Ezhou, Hubei).  - Sun Quan (182252), courtesy name Zhongmou, formally known as Emperor Da of Wu (lit. \\"Great Emperor of Wu\\"), was the founder of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He inherited control of the warlord state founded by his elder brother Sun Ce in 200. He declared formal independence and ruled from 222 to 229 as \\"King of Wu\\" and from 229 to 252 as the \\"Emperor of Wu\\". Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Quan governed his empire mostly separate of politics and ideology, he is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he accommodated the wills of both his rivals but only when it benefited his state of Wu and never fully attempted to conquer his rivals, although most of historians would cite his lack of logistical resources to do so.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.  - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.  - A courtesy name (\\"zi\\"), also known as a style name, is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name. This practice is a tradition in East Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.  - Zhou Yu (175210), courtesy name Gongjin, was a military general and strategist serving under the warlord Sun Ce in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He continued serving under Sun Quan, Sun Ce's younger brother and successor, after Sun Ce died in 200 CE. Around late 208, the northern warlord Cao Cao led his forces south with the intention of conquering the Jiangdong region, where Sun Quan's territories were based. Zhou Yu, as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces, defeated Cao Cao at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. He then led Sun Quan's forces at the follow-up Battle of Jiangling and defeated Cao Cao's forces again. Zhou Yu's victories helped to solidify the survivability of Sun Quan's regime, which served as the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). He died in 210 at a relatively young age of 35 while preparing for a conquest of the Bashu region (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing).  - Yuan Shao (died 28 June 202), courtesy name Benchu, was a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He occupied the northern territories of China during the civil war that occurred towards the end of the Han Dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era. He was also an elder half-brother of Yuan Shu, a warlord who controlled the Huai River region, though the two were not on good terms with each other.  - Dong Zhuo (died 22 May 192), courtesy name Zhongying, was a politician and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He seized control of the capital Luoyang in 189 when it was in a state of turmoil following the death of Emperor Ling and a clash between the eunuch faction and some court officials led by General-in-Chief He Jin. Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Emperor Shao and instated Emperor Xian.  - Yuan Shu (died 199), courtesy name Gonglu (), was a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He rose to prominence following the collapse of the imperial court in 189.  - Liu Bei (161  10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu.  - Sun Ce (175200), courtesy name Bofu, was a military general and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was the eldest child of Sun Jian, who was killed during the Battle of Xiangyang when Sun Ce was only 16. Sun Ce then broke away from his father's overlord, Yuan Shu, and headed to southeastern China to establish his own power base there. With the help of several people, such as Zhang Zhao and Zhou Yu, Sun Ce managed to lay down the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period.  - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD).  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Huang Gai ( birth and death dates unknown ) , courtesy name Gongfu , was a military general serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty . He previously served under Sun Quan 's predecessors -- Sun Jian ( Sun Quan 's father ) and Sun Ce ( Sun Quan 's elder brother ) .  - Sun Jian (155191), courtesy name Wentai, was a military general and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He allied himself with Yuan Shu in 190 when warlords from eastern China formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who held the puppet Emperor Xian in his power. Although he controlled neither many troops nor much land, Sun Jian's personal bravery and resourcefulness were feared by Dong Zhuo, who placed him among Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Liu Biao as the most influential men at that time. After the coalition disbanded in the next year, China fell into massive civil war. In 191, Sun Jian was killed in battle during an offensive campaign against Liu Biao.  - Zhang Zhao (156236), courtesy name Zibu, was an official of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period.  - Cao Cao (155  15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals.

The sheets didn't fit on the bed but were just right for the cot, as the","output":"sheets were specifically designed for a smaller sleeping space, providing optimal comfort to the user. The choice of fabric, thread count, and patterns used were meticulously selected to suit the cozy dimensions of the cot, creating a snug, safe, and supportive environment for those resting within. The sheets, originally purchased for a standard bed, had been acquired with the intention of dressing the larger mattress and ideally providing a smooth, soft, and comfortable surface for the user to sleep on. However, upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the size of these sheets was not suitable for the bed in question. This discrepancy could have arisen due to various factors such as miscommunication, misunderstanding, or a simple mistake when purchasing the sheets. Despite the initial disappointment, the discovery that these sheets were a perfect match for the cot turned out to be a fortunate twist of events. In fact, this newfound usage brought a sense of silver lining to the situation, as the cot, which might have been overlooked or neglected in terms of providing optimal comfort, was now elevated in terms of design and functionality. By fitting the sheets perfectly on the cot, the individual was able to improve the appearance of the smaller sleeping space, making it more inviting and visually appealing. The use of matching sheets could also create a cohesive look and feel within the room, establishing a harmonious environment that promotes relaxation and wellbeing. Additionally, the perfect fit ensured that the user did not have to worry about loose edges, sliding corners, or any excessive fabric that could compromise the sleep quality or cause discomfort during the night. By adhering to the contours of the cot, the sheets also minimized the formation of creases, lumps, or bunching, which could be detrimental to a good night's sleep. In conclusion, despite the initial setback faced when the sheets did not fit the intended bed, the individual managed to find an alternative solution that was not only functional but also contributed positively to the overall aesthetics of the space. The sheets' compatibility with the cot transformed a potentially frustrating situation into an advantageous one, highlighting the importance of adaptability and open-mindedness in overcoming challenges and making the best out of any given circumstance."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

They both focus on preparation strategies to excel in the examination. I will provide a detailed answer to the common question of how to study and excel in the CA CPT. To study and excel in the CA CPT, follow these steps: 1. Understand the exam format: Before beginning your preparation, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the exam format. The CA CPT consists of multiple-choice questions divided into four sections: Fundamentals of Accounting, Mercantile Laws, General Economics, and Quantitative Aptitude. There is a total of 200 marks, and you must score a minimum of 100 marks to qualify. 2. Create a study plan: Develop a realistic and well-structured study plan that covers all the subjects, allocates ample time for revision, and includes time for breaks. Stick to your plan to maintain consistency in your studies. 3. Gather study materials: Collect relevant study materials, including textbooks, reference books, and sample papers from reliable sources. Online study material provided by the ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) can be very helpful, as well as materials provided by reputable coaching institutes. 4. Strengthen your basics: Focus on building a strong foundation in accounting concepts, economic principles, and mathematical techniques. As the CA CPT is an entry-level examination, a solid understanding of the basics is crucial for excelling in the test. 5. Regular practice: Practice regularly to improve your speed and accuracy. Solve sample papers and mock tests, timed, if possible, to familiarize yourself with the exam environment. Consistent practice will not only help you in identifying your weak areas but also build your confidence for the actual exam. 6. Stay up-to-date: To excel in the General Economics section, it is crucial to stay updated with the latest economic developments, policies, and government schemes. Regularly read newspapers, financial journals, and business magazines for this purpose. 7. Revise regularly: Revision is critical in retaining information and filling knowledge gaps. Dedicate a specific time for revision in your study plan and ensure to review all the subjects periodically. 8. Hone your time management skills: As CA CPT is a time-bound examination (4 hours), it is essential to manage your time efficiently. Allocate a specific amount of time for each section and practice answering questions quickly and accurately. 9. Seek help when needed: If you face any challenges in understanding a particular topic, seek help from your teachers, mentors, or peers. Joining a coaching institute or online study groups can provide additional support during your preparation. 10. Take care of your health: A healthy body and mind contribute to effective learning. Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and take breaks to prevent burnout. Ensure you get adequate sleep to help your brain retain information better. By following these steps, you can improve your chances of studying effectively and excelling in the CA CPT examination.

Christian's best friend and roommate is Julie Taylor (Rebekah Johnson), who also works as a waitress and barmaid at Lila's Restaurant. His other co-workers include Traci Levine (Amber Benson), a young woman who struggles to get by while hoping to become a famous actress, and Andrew (Khary Payton), another aspiring young actor and openly gay party animal who has been HIV-positive since he was 15 because of his promiscuous lifestyle in junior high school, but still remains in good health.

The Steelers scored first in the first quarter when Ben Roethlisberger found Xavier Grimble on a 20-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 lead. The Ravens closed out the first quarter with a Justin Tucker field goal from 41 yards out for a 7-3 lead. In the second quarter, Tucker kicked another field goal this one from 38 yards out to make the halftime score 7-6. In the third quarter, the Ravens moved into the lead when Joe Flacco found Steve Smith Sr. on an 18-yard touchdown pass with a successful two-point conversion to make it 14-7. The Steelers drew closer when Chris Boswell made a 36-yard field goal to make it 14-10. Though the Ravens moved back ahead by a touchdown when Tucker kicked a 46-yard field goal to make it 17-10. In the fourth quarter, Tucker kicked a 23-yard field goal to send the Ravens up by double digits and make the score 20-10. The Steelers eventually retook the lead with 2 straight touchdowns: Le'Veon Bell ran for one from 7-yards out followed by Roethlisberger finding Bell on a 7-yard pass to take the score to 24-20. The Ravens retook the lead when Kyle Juszczyk ran for a 10-yard touchdown to make it 27-24. However, the Steelers completed the comeback when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 4-yard pass to make the final score 31-27. With their four-game losing streak against the Ravens snapped, the Steelers improved to 10-5 and were awarded the AFC North division title. The team also won six games in a row for the first time since 2004. Question: Who scored fewer points in the first quarter? Answer:","output":"The team that scored fewer points in the first quarter was the Ravens. The game started with the Steelers taking an early lead when their quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, found Xavier Grimble for a 20-yard touchdown pass. This successful offensive play put 7 points on the board for the Steelers.  However, the Ravens managed to respond, albeit not in equivalent measure. Their kicker, Justin Tucker, was successful with a 41-yard field goal which gave the Ravens their first and only points in the first quarter. This field goal contributed 3 points to their score which made it a 7-3 game in favor of the Steelers at the end of the first quarter. Therefore, comparing the scores of both teams at the end of the first quarter, it is apparent that the Ravens with 3 points scored significantly less than the Steelers who had tallied 7 points. Football scoring rules dictate that a touchdown, like the one completed by the Steelers, is worth 6 points with an additional point added for a successful conversion kick, while a field goal, like the one completed by the Ravens, is worth only 3 points. Thus, in the first quarter, the Ravens ended up scoring fewer points than the Steelers."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Given the following context:  In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who suffered heart attacks in 1966 and again in 1971?

Summarize this article: America      After Tornadoes, States Now Brace For Flooding      i itoggle caption Gene Blevins/Reuters/Landov Gene Blevins/Reuters/Landov      The weather system that spawned tornadoes that killed at least 35 people this week throughout the South and Midwest is dumping heavy rain, triggering fears of major flooding.      After a slew of tornadoes that began overnight Sunday, forecasts for a third day of deadly twisters on Tuesday thankfully did not entirely hold up. Although there were reports of eight tornadoes in North Carolina, they caused only minor damage and no injuries. An additional four tornadoes were spotted in eastern and central South Carolina.      But there were no reports of fatalities, unlike with the tornadoes that ripped through Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, killing 35 people.      Flooding is now the overriding concern.      The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings and watches for large areas of the East and parts of the South, from New York to Alabama.      In the area of Fayetteville, N.C., there have already been reports of flash flooding as some drivers were stranded by rising water and had to be pulled from their vehicles. One person was reported dead in flash flooding in the Florida Panhandle. Flooding in Pensacola was being described by officials as \\"life-threatening\\" and of \\"historic\\" proportions.      Meanwhile, the cleanup has begun in states hard-hit by this week's storms      \\"We will overcome this,\\" Louisville, Miss., Mayor Will Hill said against a backdrop of hundreds of damaged buildings, including two hilltop churches pounded to rubble, The Associated Press reports. \\"We're going to work together.\\"      The AP adds: ||||| LOUISVILLE, Miss. (AP) — In the latest blow from a dayslong chain of severe weather across the South and Midwest, the Florida Panhandle and other parts of the Gulf Coast were hit with widespread flooding early Wednesday, with people stranded in cars and homes waiting for rescuers to find a way around impassable roads and others abandoning vehicles to walk to safety.

A dangerous storm system that spawned a chain of deadly tornadoes over... (Associated Press)      Fire rescue crews weren't able to respond to some calls for help because of road flooding in and around Pensacola, Escambia County spokesman Bill Pearson said.      \\"It's gotten to the point where we can't send EMS and fire rescue crews out on some 911 calls because they can't get there,\\" Pearson said. \\"We've had people whose homes are flooding and they've had to climb up to the attic.\\"      Some people left their flooded cars and walked to find help on their own. \\"We have people at the police department,\\" Officer Justin Cooper of the Pensacola Police Department said. \\"They walked up here and are hanging out until things get better.\\"      As much as 15 to 20 inches had fallen in Pensacola in a 24-hour period, National Weather Service meteorologist Phil Grigsby in New Orleans said Wednesday morning, with a few more inches expected. Grigsby said aerial rescues were planned, and the county moved boats and jet skis from the beaches to the streets to help. A portion of Interstate 10 was closed.      \\"We've seen pictures that people are posting with water halfway up their doors, front doors,\\" Grigsby said. \\"It's going to be a big cleanup, looks like.\\"      The widespread flooding is the latest wallop of a storm system that still packed considerable punch days after the violent outbreak began in Arkansas and Oklahoma. At least 35 people have been killed in that storms that started Sunday and spread from Oklahoma to North Carolina.      In Baldwin County on the Alabama Gulf Coast, crews had been rescuing stranded people since before midnight and some were in shelters Wednesday morning, said Mitchell Sims, emergency management director.      \\"As soon as we get a water rescue team in here, they're sent back out,\\" he said. \\"We're rescuing people from cars, from rooftops, from all over the place.      \\"I think we're gonna be dealing with this for days,\\" added Sims, who estimated that 12 to 17 inches of rain had fallen in 24 hours. \\"I don't know where the water's going to go. Everything is saturated.\\"      Over the past four days, the storms hit especially hard in places such as Arkansas' northern Little Rock suburbs and the Mississippi cities of Louisville and Tupelo. Arkansas, with 15 deaths after a tornado blasted through Sunday, and Mississippi with 12 deaths from Monday's storms, accounted for the brunt of the death toll.      \\"We will overcome this,\\" Louisville Mayor Will Hill said against a backdrop of hundreds of damaged buildings, including two hilltop churches pounded to rubble. \\"We're going to work together.\\"      Authorities in Louisville searched until dark Tuesday for an 8-year-old boy missing since Monday's large tornado that killed his parents and destroyed the home where they lived. Though searchers didn't rule out finding the boy alive, officials were describing the process as one of \\"recovery.\\"      After days of storm destruction, some didn't take any chances late Tuesday with yet more tornado watches.      Simon Turner and her 7-year-old son, Christopher, scrambled to a shelter in Tuscaloosa, Ala., after hearing that a tornado watch had been issued around that city.      Frightened by memories of a killer tornado that partly demolished Tuscaloosa three years ago, the Turners had opted for refuge in a school with a reinforced hallway. \\"We'll be here till they say it's OK to leave,\\" Turner said before the all-clear came.      The dead Monday included University of Alabama swimmer John Servati, who authorities say took shelter in the basement of a home when a retaining wall collapsed. Servati was a business major on the dean's list.      Some survived or died amid split-second decisions.      William Quinn, 25, and others dove under the gap beneath a house in Mars Hill, Miss., seconds before a tornado blew heavily damaged the home and sheared off the roofs of nearby poultry houses. He called his decision \\"a spur of the moment thing.\\"      But in the southern Tennessee community of Fayetteville, a married couple was killed Monday in a tornado after returning to their mobile home after mistakenly believing the danger had passed, a neighbor said. Authorities identified the victims as John Prince, 60, and his wife Karen, 44.      \\"We pulled up, and were in shocked seeing our own home. But then we saw Karen's father, and he said 'John and Karen are gone — They didn't make it,'\\" recalled neighbor Tiffani Danner. She had left and came back to find her own home destroyed as well.      Darrell Haney, in a home nearby, thought that community was out of the woods when TV switched from tornado warnings back to regular programming — then suddenly cut back to a possible tornado.      Haney quickly plucked up two grandchildren and huddled in a bathroom with his wife, daughter and son-in-law. Almost immediately, he said, a tree crashed into a front room where one of the children had been sleeping. The roof was lifted off of the master bedroom.      \\"The house is being torn apart around you, and we're just crying out, 'God protect us,'\\" Haney said. \\"Because at that point you're totally hopeless and helpless.\\"      Elsewhere, Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe visited several homes Tuesday that were damaged by a deadly twister, stopping at one location where three members of a family were killed. Three of Arkansas' 15 deaths were a father and two daughters and Beebe spoke to survivors, including two of the man's other daughters.      \\"It was kind of heartbreaking those two little girls that I talked to that lost two of their siblings and their dad,\\" Beebe said afterward. \\"That's utter destruction up there ... and these people need to know that folks care about them.\\"      ___      Associated Press writers Jack Elliott Jr. in Jackson, Miss., Jay Reeves in Kimberly, Ala., Erik Schelzig in Fayetteville, Tenn., and Christina Huynh in Ferndale, Ark., contributed to this report. Michael Hempen of AP Radio in Washington also contributed. ||||| Story highlights Storms caused 38 deaths since Sunday; 67-year-old woman killed in Florida      Tornado that struck Mayflower and Vilonia, Arkansas, Sunday was an EF-4      Alabama official: Residents scrambled to rooftops as water rushed in      National Weather Service: The rainfall at Pensacola's airport set a record      From building-crushing hurricanes to killer sinkholes, Gulf Coast residents have seen a lot. But even these battle-tested veterans of the weather wars are marveling at torrential rains that washed out bridges and roads, sent chest-high water into homes and forced major military bases to shut down Wednesday.      \\"We've seen flooding before, but never flooding that washes the back of a house away,\\" said CNN iReporter Matt Raybourn of Pensacola, Florida. \\"There are no words for what we are seeing here.\\"      The rushing waters reduced some streets to rubble, gouged huge gashes in others and left stretches of many others submerged, including parts U.S. 98, the main east-west route along the coast. It was closed in several places between Fort Walton Beach and Panama City. Abandoned cars sat half-submerged along the highway.      Along the coast, water pushed ashore by wind-driven waves and unusually high tides lapped at sand dunes as red flags warned swimmers to stay out of the water.      There was one drowning death tied to the flooding, Florida officials said. The victim, a 67-year-old woman, drove or was swept into a drainage ditch Tuesday night, Escambia County spokeswoman Kathleen Castro said.      In Alabama, waters rushed in so fast that residents climbed on top of furniture and waited on rooftops to be rescued, said Reggie Chitwood, deputy director of emergency management in Baldwin County.      \\"The waters rose at a historical level. ... People had to scramble,\\" Chitwood told CNN's \\"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\\"      In a neighborhood north of Pensacola, a creek overran its banks, inundating homes and forcing residents to retreat to their attics to await rescue, Escambia County spokesman Bill Pearson said.      Rescuers were reaching the residents on state Fish and Wildlife boats and personal watercraft normally used to patrol the county's beaches, he said. The National Guard was also on the way.

As much as 18.9 inches of rain fell over 24 hours in Alabama and Florida, according to the National Weather Service.      At Pensacola's airport, an estimated 15.55 inches of rain fell on Tuesday -- the largest amount to fall in a single calendar day since officials started tracking rainfall in 1880, the National Weather Service said.      It was all the result of a slow-moving and massive storm system that sucked up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico for days before dumping it back onto land in a series of thunderstorms, said CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray.      Satellites captured an image of the water vapor held aloft by the storm tracing a huge sideways 'S' shape across much of the country.      As the storm crept up the eastern seaboard Wednesday afternoon, heavy rains caused flooding in the Washington area.      In Baltimore, the edge of a street buckled in a landslide that sent cars tumbling into a ravine. No one was injured, the city's transportation department said.      In Perdido Key, Florida, iReporter Steve Olensky described the storm as a \\"hurricane and tornado all in one.\\" \\"It was blowing and blowing, the rain was coming. It was just incredible,\\" said Olensky, whose 22-foot boat vanished in the storm. \\"We've been through (hurricanes) Ivan and Katrina, and we've never seen anything like this.\\"      There's one major difference between this week's storms and a hurricane, Pensacola resident Cindi Bonner told CNN.      \\"You have time to prepare for a hurricane,\\" she said. \\"This was not something that anyone had prepared for.\\"      Damage to bridges, disruption to military bases      Many roads in the city of Gulf Shores, Alabama, were \\"totally flooded,\\" the city said on Twitter. At least three heavily used bridges in Escambia County, Florida, had been badly damaged or destroyed, said Pearson, the county spokesman.      Naval Air Station Pensacola, Eglin Air Force Base and Hurlburt Field, another Air Force installation, were closed to all but essential personnel, the installations said on their Twitter and Facebook accounts.      In nearby Baldwin County, Alabama, the Fish River reached historic flooding levels, according to the National Weather Service.      Most government offices in the Florida Panhandle were closed Wednesday, as were many schools. Pearson said emergency officials were urging businesses to stay closed as well and were asking motorists to stay off the roads.

Tens of thousands remained without power in the South, where suspected tornadoes tore through homes and businesses late Monday.      Officials revealed new details Wednesday about the powerful tornado that struck the Arkansas towns of Mayflower and Vilonia.      The twister was rated an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage scale, with an estimated peak wind speed between 180 and 190 mph, the National Weather Service said. It was on the ground for 41.3 miles on Sunday and was responsible for 15 deaths, officials said.      In addition to the Florida flooding death, police in Athens, Georgia, said a driver was killed Wednesday when storm winds toppled a tree onto a car.      Authorities in Mississippi confirmed another death from storms that struck Monday.      At least 38 people have been killed since Sunday in storm-related deaths in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Florida and Georgia, according to a CNN tally of state reports.      The storm could bring heavy rains and possibly thunderstorms to Jacksonville, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Atlanta, the National Weather Service said.      Heavy rain will be the norm.      Flooding could be a concern in the New York City area on Thursday. Forecasters say rainfall could total up to four inches, with heavier amounts in some areas. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      The worst flooding in Florida in a generation — more than 2 feet of water in 26 hours, by one rain gauge — left drivers stranded overnight and into Wednesday, the latest pummeling from the monster storm system lumbering across the country.      Tornado warnings were posted in the morning in Florida, Alabama and North Carolina, and authorities reported two storm-related deaths in Georgia. The risk for tornadoes later in the day was highest from South Carolina to Washington, D.C., forecasters said.      They said that Wednesday would probably be the last day of the severe-weather threat from the storm system, which has killed 38 people in eight states in a relentless eastward push of wind and water.      On Tuesday, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle got the worst of it. At least one person was killed, a man in Florida whose car got stuck in rising water. He called for help, but the water was moving too quickly, authorities said.      Five inches of rain fell on Pensacola, Fla., in a single hour, from 9 to 10 p.m. Tuesday — more than during the entirety of Hurricane Ivan, which rolled through in 2004, said Kevin Roth, lead meteorologist for The Weather Channel.      “It went on and on and on. It was relentless,” Cheryl Clendenon, who was stranded in her home in Pensacola Beach until a friend picked her up, told NBC News. “I used to like the sound of rain to help me get to sleep, but this was like Chinese water torture. It just did not stop.” |||||","output":"A severe weather system in the South and Midwest of the U.S., that previously sparked tornadoes which claimed 35 lives, has now resulted in heavy rain forecasts, prompting fears of major flooding. After a series of tornadoes, further predictions for a third day of deadly twisters did not entirely come to pass, with reported tornadoes in North Carolina and South Carolina causing minor damage and no injuries. However, major flood warnings have been issued for the East and parts of the South. In Fayetteville, N.C., reports of flash flooding have already emerged.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Kansas carries on with new members, new songs “Miracles Out of Nowhere,” a documentary film released in 2015, illuminated one of pop music’s least likely success stories: the rise of home-grown progressive-rock band Kansas from heartland obscurity to million-selling, arena-filling superstardom. For countless lovers of the group’s biggest hits — “Carry on Wayward Son” from 1976, “Dust in the Wind” from 1977 — the film lovingly and candidly chronicled the hard-working band’s journey to household-name status. Longtime fans, however, knew that was only half the story. Omitted from “Miracles” — purposely intended as an uplifting saga, according to drummer Phil Ehart — were the rougher waters into which Kansas sailed after 1980: creative and philosophical conflicts, substance-abuse issues, personnel changes, and the fickle tides of taste, all contributing to a turbulent few decades. In particular, singer Steve Walsh departed in 1981, followed in 1983 by guitarist and chief songwriter Kerry Livgren; Walsh returned in 1985, then retired from the stage in 2014. Through it all, Kansas stayed the course. Now comprising founders Ehart and guitarist Rich Williams, long-serving members David Ragsdale on violin and guitar and Billy Greer on bass, and two relative newcomers, keyboardist David Manion and singer Ronnie Platt, the band has just completed a new album, “The Prelude Implicit,” due in September. Recently we caught up with Ehart by phone in Atlanta, checking in before Kansas plays the historic Cabot in Beverly on Friday. Q. The album you’ve just completed is the first one Kansas has ever made without either of the key writers of your early years, Kerry Livgren and Steve Walsh. How did you approach writing new material this time? A. Your question was also my question: How in the heck are we going to do this? Let’s just say the material was written by the guys in the band. Obviously there are some members who wrote more than others, but it is a collective effort from the producer, Zak Rizvi, and the band. You always have to be careful when you’re talking about material that hasn’t come out yet — I get tired of hearing somebody go, “Let me tell you, this is the best album we’ve ever made.” The only thing that’ll ever tell anybody creating anything whether it’s the best they’ve ever done will be the test of time, and you can’t judge things now like you did in the ’70s and ’80s, because these days, albums don’t sell like they used to. I will just tell you that we’re very proud about what we’ve done, we’re very excited about what we’ve done, and the rest is up to the fans. Q. Kansas has spanned a variety of styles over the years, from sophisticated songs like “Song for America” and “Closet Chronicles” to more mainstream fare like “Play the Game Tonight” and “Fight Fire With Fire,” just sticking to your current set list. What direction emerged this time? A. It’s very progressive — or, as our fans call it, prog. This is a very prog record. It is very complex, some of the most difficult tracks — maybe the most difficult tracks, in spots — that we’ve recorded. It’s very lyrical, very melodic, but that’s what we wanted to get back into: that progressive material that always set Kansas apart as an American band. Q. A frontman is a fundamental part of a group’s identity and chemistry. How did Ronnie Platt come into the picture? A. Ronnie came into the picture out of necessity. We didn’t want to turn backward: “Let’s get a singer who sounds exactly like Steve, so we can do all the old stuff.” This was very calculated: Let’s get a great singer that we can forge ahead with. Steve was an incredible singer; let’s find another incredible singer. Q. Why did you end ‘Miracles Out of Nowhere” with the band at the pinnacle of success? Were you reluctant to dwell on latter days? Is there another film to be made? A. Those are the questions that I had to ask myself, because I had to sell it to the other guys. How am I going to cover a 40-year span with all these different guys, and all the ups and downs? And it just kind of came to me: Well, I don’t really have to. With anybody telling a life story, there are certain roads that people just aren’t going to want to do down. You go, I’m just not going to tell that story, because it sucks. The story I wanted to tell was those [first] five albums. That was not only the heyday; it was a miracle. Once we reached the pinnacle, it was no longer uplifting. It wasn’t even fun. It was a bunch of men arguing with each other. I’ve seen a lot of documentaries about bands like that, where they become bitter and downtrodden. Who wants to sit through that? And when I talked to the guys, as soon as I said, I want you to know that if we’re going to do this, I don’t want to talk about drugs, I don’t want to talk about drinking and all the stuff that went on in this band that actually hurt a lot of the guys . . . as soon as I said that, boy, everybody was up for it.

The reviewer's actions: The statement \\"I do not love this at all\\" further reinforces the negative perspective. Moreover, the fact that the reviewer gave the CD away indicates dissatisfaction with the product. 3. Criticism of the style: The reviewer expresses that the product does not represent what they believe folk and Bruce are about, implying that the product failed to meet their expectations in terms of genre and style. 4. Criticism of the arrangements: The reviewer argues that the arrangements detract from the \\"spareness\\" that defines the folk music genre.

Background: William Roy \\"Link\\" Lyman (November 30, 1898 - December 28, 1972), also sometimes known as Roy Lyman, was an American football player and coach. Lyman was born in Nebraska and raised in Kansas. He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team in 1918, 1919, and 1921. He played professional football as a tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs (1922-1925), the Frankford Yellow Jackets (1925), and the Chicago Bears (1926-1928, 1930-1932, and 1933-1934). Context: In September 1922, Lyman left Lincoln, Nebraska, to play professional football for the Canton Bulldogs. The Bulldogs were coached by Guy Chamberlin, an All-American out of Nebraska, who invited Lyman to join the team. With Lyman and Pete Henry as its star tackles, the 1922 Canton Bulldogs compiled a 10-0-2 record, shut out nine of twelve opponents, outscored all opponents 184 to 15, and won the NFL championship.  Lyman returned to the Bulldogs the following year. The 1923 team had another undefeated season (11-0-1), shut out eight of twelve opponents, outscored all opponents by a combined total of 246 to 19, and won its second consecutive NFL championship. After the season, Lyman was selected as a first-team All-Pro player by the Canton Daily News and a second-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye magazine.  In August 1924, Cleveland jeweler Samuel Deutsch bought the Canton Bulldogs and moved the team to Cleveland where they became the Cleveland Bulldogs during the 1924 NFL season. The Bulldogs compiled a 7-1-1 record, outscored opponents by a total of 229 to 60, and won their third consecutive NFL championship. After the 1924 season, Lyman was selected as a first-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye and a second-team All-Pro by the Green Bay Press-Gazette.  In July 1925, Lyman and four of his teammates (Pete Henry, Rudy Comstock, Ben Jones, and Harry Robb) bought the team for 3,500 and moved it back to Canton. Lyman played seven games for the 1925 Bulldogs and then finished the season playing four games for the Frankford Yellow Jackets. Lyman was reunited with Guy Chamberlain who was then Frankford's head coach. After the 1925 season, Lyman was selected as a first-team All-Pro on the team selected by NFL Commissioner Joseph Carr; he was also selected as a second-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye. Question: Did Lyman receive any awards while playing with the Bulldogs?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Link Lyman received several awards while playing with the Bulldogs. He was recognized for his performances during the 1923, 1924, and 1925 seasons, being selected for All-Pro honors by various publications and even the NFL Commissioner. In 1923, after the Canton Bulldogs secured their second consecutive NFL championship, Lyman was chosen as a first-team All-Pro player by the Canton Daily News and a second-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye magazine. Following the 1924 season, when the team had become the Cleveland Bulldogs, Lyman received first-team All-Pro honors from Collyer's Eye and second-team All-Pro recognition from the Green Bay Press-Gazette. Finally, at the end of the 1925 season, Lyman was chosen as a first-team All-Pro by NFL Commissioner Joseph Carr, and he was also named a second-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye once more.

Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, emerged in part as a reaction against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by \\"youthful exuberance and desire for recognition\\". The leading Britpop bands, \\"Blur and Oasis[,] exist[ed] as reactionary forces to [grunge's] eternal downcast glare.\\"  Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States in the spring of 1992.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota.  - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota.  - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota . South Dakota has 82,447 miles of highways , roads and streets ; 5,905 bridges . The SD DOT is responsible for 7,830 miles of the roadway system .

People, towns, high schools, and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back alumni and former residents. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet and, most often, a game of American football, or, on occasion, basketball, ice hockey or soccer. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring the school's marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming Queen (and at many schools, a Homecoming King). A dance commonly follows the game or the day following the game. When attached to a football game, Homecoming traditionally occurs on the team's return from the longest road trip of the season. The game itself, whether it be football or another sport, will typically feature the home team playing a considerably weaker opponent. The game is supposed to be an \\"easy win\\" and thus weaker schools will sometimes play lower division schools.  - The Quad is an approximately quadrangle on the campus of the University of Alabama located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Home to most of the university's original buildings, this portion of the campus remains the geographic and historic center of the modern campus. Originally designed by noted English-born architect William Nichols, construction of the university campus began in 1828, following the move of the Alabama state capital from Cahaba to Tuscaloosa in 1826. The overall design for this early version of the campus was patterned after Thomas Jefferson's plan for the University of Virginia, with its Lawn and Rotunda. Following the destruction of the campus during the American Civil War, a new Quad emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines. Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts. In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts. \\"Our brain has billions of body cells . These send signals through the spinal cord  to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries  or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part.\\" Tavella says. \\"Our system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines.\\" The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp  and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain. Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands.\\" The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair.\\" He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from.

They later moved to London, UK. Three of the members went on to form DragonForce. Their rather unusual musical style has often been labeled as \\"blackened power metal\\". Hypothesis: Demoniac got it's name from the Bible.","output":"Based on the given context, we cannot definitively say that Demoniac got their name from the Bible. While it is possible that the name could be inspired by biblical references, there is no specific mention of the source of the band's name in the provided information. To draw a more conclusive hypothesis, we would need to consider additional data points or gather further information about the band's inspirations or motivations behind the name. There might be several other reasons contributing to the choice of the band's name, such as personal experiences, literary influences, cultural references, or even a combination of various elements. In the realm of heavy metal music and its subgenres, band names often reflect the overall theme, sound, or aesthetic the members wish to portray. This is particularly true in black metal, which commonly features themes related to darkness, evil, and the occult. Given that Demoniac has been labeled as \\"blackened power metal,\\" it is possible that their name might allude to these themes instead. However, without more evidence, we cannot definitively identify the main inspiration behind their name. In summary, while it is plausible that Demoniac's name might have been inspired by the Bible, there is not enough context to conclude that this is the case. Further investigation would be necessary to explore the origin of the band's name and identify the primary source of inspiration behind it."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Chung Dong-young (born July 27, 1953 in Sunchang County, North Jeolla) is a politician and was the United New Democratic Party candidate for President of South Korea in 2007.  - The 17th South Korean presidential election took place on 19 December 2007 .

Movie title: Teza Context: Teza, which means morning dew in Amharic, tells a story of hope, loss, and reminiscence through the eyes of an idealistic, young intellectual, displaced from his homeland of Ethiopia for many years. The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Where are the tourists standing?
