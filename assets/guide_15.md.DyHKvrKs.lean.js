This article: The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \\"fugitive\\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first of the \\"Grand Tunes\\", Cavaradossi's \\"Recondita armonia\\" with its sustained high B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody. The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\".

's too long and unfocused .","output":"To analyze the sentiment of the movie review sentence, we first need to break down the phrasing and key language that helps to understand the reviewer's emotions towards the movie. The sentence provided is: \\"It's too long and unfocused.\\" 1. \\"too long\\": The reviewer uses the phrase \\"too long,\\" suggesting that the movie's duration was excessive in their opinion. This indicates a negative sentiment, as it implies that the movie could have been improved by shortening it, possibly making it crisper and more engaging. 2. \\"and unfocused\\": The word \\"unfocused\\" points to another potentially negative element in the movie, as it might suggest that the plot lacked direction, coherence, or a clear purpose. This may have led the reviewer to feel unsatisfied or frustrated with the narrative, contributing further to a negative sentiment. Conclusively, the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"It's too long and unfocused\\" is primarily negative. Both the aspects mentioned in the review— the excessive length and lack of focus— are unfavorable, and it appears that the reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with the movie. However, this is just one sentence, and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's overall sentiment towards the movie, taking the entire review into account might provide deeper insights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When you walk into a room where a blind person is waiting, saying something right away will alert them to your presence. Being quiet until you’re right next to the person might make them feel as though you just snuck up out of nowhere, which isn’t comfortable for anyone.  Say your name so they know who you are. If the person offers a hand to shake, go ahead. It might not be intuitive, but you should always say something when you're about to leave. Don't just assume the person will be able to hear you walking out. It's impolite to walk away without saying anything, since you’ll leave the person talking to air. This is frustrating and embarrassing. If it seems as though the person could use some assistance, the best thing to do is ask instead of just assuming they require your help. Just politely say, \\"would you like me to help?\\" If the answer is yes, ask what they'd like you to do. But if the answer is no, it's impolite to insist. Many blind people are perfectly capable of getting around without help.  If they say they’d like assistance, do only what is asked, and no more. It’s common for well-meaning sighted people to “take over” and end up hurting more than they’ve helped. In some situations, there's really no need to even ask. For example, if everyone's sitting around a table and the blind person is already seated, you don't need to walk up and ask if there's anything you can do. Be sensitive to the situation and don't make assumptions. Many people who don't have experience around the blind aren't sure how to address the blind person, so they instead address his or her companion. In a restaurant, for example, it's common for servers to ask the person seated next to a blind person if they would like more water, a menu, and so on. Blind people can hear just fine, and there's absolutely no reason not to address them as you would anyone else. ” Your inclination might be to disrupt your normal speech habits and try to find ways around saying words like \\"look\\" and \\"see.\\" It’s okay to use these common words when not using them would sound awkward. It could make a blind person more uncomfortable for you to talk to them in a way that's different from how you'd talk to other people.  For example, you can say “It’s really nice to see you\\" or \\"It looks like rain tonight.\\" However, don’t use words like “look” and “see” when to do so would be impossible for the person. For example, if the person is about to collide with something, it’s more helpful to say “Stop!” instead of “Watch out!” Guide dogs are highly trained animals that enhance the lives and safety of blind people. Blind people rely on their guide dogs to navigate, and that's why you shouldn't call or pet one.  If the dog becomes distracted, this could create a dangerous situation. Don’t do anything that could take up the dog’s attention. If the person invites you to pet the dog, its OK to do so, but don't touch the dog otherwise. Asking a lot of questions or making a big deal about someone being blind is impolite. Blind people have already answered these questions. Every day they encounter situations and places that cater to people who are sighted. You can help a blind person feel more comfortable by being sensitive to this and just talking with them in a normal way.  One common myth people often ask blind people about is whether they have a heightened sense of hearing or smell. Blind people have to rely on these senses more than sighted people do, but it's not true that they have super powers when it comes to hearing and smell, and it's rude to assume that. The person may not want to talk about why they are blind. (For example, it could have been due to a scary accident that is very painful to remember.) If they bring it up, it's fine to keep asking more questions and continue the conversation, but don't call attention to it otherwise. What is a summary?","output":"When interacting with blind individuals, it is essential to be considerate and respectful. Announce your presence when you enter a room. Offer assistance only if needed and respect their preferences and boundaries. Address the blind person directly instead of speaking to their companion or caretaker, and maintain normal speech patterns without avoiding common phrases. Be cautious not to distract guide dogs and avoid touching them unless invited. Be sensitive to questions or assumptions about the individual's abilities or personal experiences. Treat blind individuals with respect and courtesy, ensuring that your interactions prioritize their comfort and dignity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Last week, my granddaughter started kindergarten, and I wished her every success. But part of me didn't. I actually wanted her to fail in some ways because I believe that failure can be good for our learning process. Success is proving that you can do something that you already know you can do, or doing something correctly the first time, which can often be a problematic   victory. First-time success is usually a fluke  . First-time failure, by contrast, is expected to be the natural order of things. Failure is how we learn. In Africa they describe a good cook as \\"She who has broken many pots.\\" If you've spent enough time in the kitchen to have broken a lot of pots, probably you know a fair amount about cooking. I once had dinner with a group of cooks, and they spent time comparing knife wounds and burn scars. They knew how much credibility   their failures gave them. I earn my living by writing a daily newspaper column. Each week I am aware that one column I write is going to be the worst column. I try my best every day. I have learned to cherish that column. A successful column usually means that I am discussing my familiar topic, writing in a style I am used to or saying the same things as anyone else but in a fancy way. My younger daughter is a trapeze artist. She spent three years putting together a show, and she did it successfully for years. There was no reason for her to change it but she did anyway. She said she was no longer learning anything new and she was bored. And if she was bored, there was no point in subjecting (......) her body to all that stress. She risked failure and great public embarrassment in order to feed her soul. My granddaughter is a perfectionist. She will feel her failures, and I will want to comfort her. But I will also, I hope, remind her of what she learned, and how she can do better next time. I hope I can tell her, though, that it's not the end of the world. Indeed, with luck, it is the beginning.   Question: Why did the author want his granddaughter to fail?   Options: (A) Success is boring though beneficial. (B) She would learn more from failure. (C) It's impossible to do everything successfully. (D) He wanted her to be strong enough to face hardships. Output:","output":"B"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Solve this problem.","output":"To find the value of 'n' in the given equation 161 = 27*n - 4*n, you would first need to consolidate the terms involving 'n' on one side of the equation. The equation can be simplified by combining the 'n' terms: 161 = 23*n This simplification comes from subtracting 4*n from 27*n which equals 23*n.  Now, to isolate 'n', you would need to divide both sides of the equation by 23 since this is the coefficient of 'n' in the equation (a coefficient is a number multiplied by a variable). This step is necessary in order to solve for our unknown, 'n'.  n = 161 / 23  If you perform that division, you get that n = 7. So, the solution to the equation 161 = 27*n - 4*n is n = 7. This means that when you substitute 7 for 'n' in the original equation, the equation is true.  To quickly check this, you can substitute 'n' with 7 in the left-hand side of the equation: 27*7 - 4*7 = 161 From this, we find that indeed, 7 is the correct value of 'n' which satisfies the initial equation 161 = 27*n - 4*n."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: the most unpleasant things  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence is definitely negative. The sentence mentions \\"the most unpleasant things,\\" which clearly indicates a negative emotion or experience associated with the movie. The use of the word \\"unpleasant\\" suggests that the viewer found certain aspects of the movie distasteful, annoying, or otherwise objectionable. Furthermore, the fact that these are described as \\"the most\\" unpleasant things implies that these aspects stood out as particularly bad or undesirable in the viewer's opinion. In the context of a movie review, it is important for viewers to express their opinions to provide an accurate representation of the film's quality. Negative reviews can help potential viewers understand if certain aspects of a movie make it unsuitable for their tastes, while positive reviews can encourage people to watch the film. Since this given sentence is a negative statement, it would be helpful to potential viewers who would like to avoid a negative experience with the film being discussed. However, it is important to note that a single negative or positive statement does not necessarily represent the overall tone or sentiment of the entire review.

Q: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: John and Keith were playing football - the game was rough to say the least. They both got hurt. After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up. The physician found that John had inflammation, but Keith didn't have any inflammation.  Who would have dilated blood vessels near the wound, John or Keith?  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Answer:","output":"John would have dilated blood vessels near the wound, as he has inflammation which is the body's response to infection or injury and involves the dilation of blood vessels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Rushmore Context: Max Fischer (Schwartzman), an eccentric 15-year-old, is a scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a private school in Houston. He is both Rushmore's most extracurricularly active and least scholarly student. He spends nearly all of his time on elaborate extracurricular activities, not at all bothered how it affects his grades. He also has a feud with the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim. Herman Blume (Murray) is a disillusioned industrialist who finds his operation of a multimillion-dollar company to be tedious. He is upset that his marriage is failing and the two sons he's putting through Rushmore are impolite and obnoxious brats spoiled by their mother. Herman comes to like Max, and the two become good friends. Max is proud of Herman's success while Herman is interested by Max's arrogant persona. Rosemary Cross (Williams) is a widowed teacher who arrives at Rushmore as a new first grade instructor. She joined Rushmore after the death of her husband, who was also a former Rushmore student. Max quickly develops an obsession with Rosemary and makes many attempts at pursuing her. While she initially tolerates Max, Rosemary becomes increasingly worried by his obvious infatuation with her. Along the way, Blume attempts to convince Max that Rosemary is not worth the trouble, only to fall for Rosemary himself. The two begin dating without Max's knowledge. After Max attempts to break ground on an aquarium without the school's approval, he is expelled from Rushmore. He is then forced to enroll in his first public school, Grover Cleveland High. Max's attempts to engage in outside activities at his new school have mixed results. A fellow student, Margaret Yang, tries to befriend Max, but he acts hostile towards her. Rosemary and Blume attempt to support him in his new school.

As far as murder mystery films go, it just doesn't get any better than this one.

I particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one's running time.

Hide Caption 36 of 37 ||||| The network of political appointees reports to Rick Dearborn, left, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, according to administration officials. At center is Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)      The political appointee charged with keeping watch over Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and his aides has offered unsolicited advice so often that after just four weeks on the job, Pruitt has shut him out of many staff meetings, according to two senior administration officials.      At the Pentagon, they’re privately calling the former Marine officer and fighter pilot who’s supposed to keep his eye on Defense Secretary Jim Mattis “the commissar,” according to a high-ranking defense official with knowledge of the situation. It’s a reference to Soviet-era Communist Party officials who were assigned to military units to ensure their commanders remained loyal.      Most members of President Trump’s Cabinet do not yet have leadership teams in place or even nominees for top deputies. But they do have an influential coterie of senior aides installed by the White House who are charged — above all — with monitoring the secretaries’ loyalty, according to eight officials in and outside the administration.      This shadow government of political appointees with the title of senior White House adviser is embedded at every Cabinet agency, with offices in or just outside the secretary’s suite. The White House has installed at least 16 of the advisers at departments including Energy and Health and Human Services and at some smaller agencies such as NASA, according to records first obtained by ProPublica through a Freedom of Information Act request.      These aides report not to the secretary, but to the Office of Cabinet Affairs, which is overseen by Rick Dearborn, a White House deputy chief of staff, according to administration officials. A top Dearborn aide, John Mashburn, leads a weekly conference call with the advisers, who are in constant contact with the White House.      The aides act as a go-between on policy matters for the agencies and the White House. Behind the scenes, though, they’re on another mission: to monitor Cabinet leaders and their top staffs to make sure they carry out the president’s agenda and don’t stray too far from the White House’s talking points, said several officials with knowledge of the arrangement.      “Especially when you’re starting a government and you have a changeover of parties when policies are going to be dramatically different, I think it’s something that’s smart,” said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser. “Somebody needs to be there as the White House’s man on the scene. Because there’s no senior staff yet, they’re functioning as the White House’s voice and ears in these departments.”      [Bannon vows daily fight for ‘deconstruction of the administrative state’]      The arrangement is unusual. It wasn’t used by presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton. And it’s also different from the traditional liaisons who shepherd the White House’s political appointees to the various agencies. Critics say the competing chains of command eventually will breed mistrust, chaos and inefficiency — especially as new department heads build their staffs.      “It’s healthy when there is some daylight between the president’s Cabinet and the White House, with room for some disagreement,” said Kevin Knobloch, who was chief of staff under Obama to then-Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.      “That can only happen when agency secretaries have their own team, who report directly to them,” he said. “Otherwise it comes off as not a ringing vote of confidence in the Cabinet.”      The White House declined to comment about the appointees on the record, citing the confidentiality of personnel matters and internal operations. But a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that instead of holding agencies accountable, the appointees technically report to each department’s chief of staff or to the secretaries themselves.      “The advisers were a main point of contact in the early transition process as the agencies were being set up,” the official said in an email. “Like every White House, this one is in frequent contact with agencies and departments.”      The advisers’ power may be heightened by the lack of complete leadership teams at many departments.      The long delay in getting Trump’s nominee for agriculture secretary, former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue (R), confirmed means that Sam Clovis, who was a Trump campaign adviser, and transition team leader Brian Klippenstein continue to serve as the agency’s top political appointees.      “He and Brian Klippenstein are just a handful of appointees on the ground and they’re doing a big part of the day-to-day work,” said Dale Moore, the American Farm Bureau Federation’s public policy executive director.      Every president tries to assert authority over the executive branch, with varying degrees of success.      The Obama White House kept tight control over agencies, telling senior officials what they could publicly disclose about their own department’s operations. Foreign policy became so centralized that State Department and Defense Department officials complained privately that they felt micromanaged on key decisions.      After then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. made some political gaffes, Obama aides wanted to install a political aide at the Justice Department to monitor him. But Holder was furious about the intrusion and blocked the plan. During his tenure as defense secretary, Robert M. Gates pushed back against a top official the White House wanted at the Pentagon to guide Asia policy, wary of having someone so close to the president in his orbit.      Former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a Trump adviser, said the president needs to dispatch political allies to the agencies to monitor a bureaucracy that’s being targeted for reduction.      “If you drain the swamp, you better have someone who watches over the alligators,” Gingrich said. “These people are actively trying to undermine the new government. And they think it’s their moral obligation to do so.”      At the Transportation Department, former Pennsylvania lobbyist Anthony Pugliese shuttles back and forth between the White House and DOT headquarters on New Jersey Avenue SE, according to an agency official. His office is just 20 paces from Secretary Elaine Chao’s, the official said.      Day to day, Pugliese and his counterparts inform Cabinet officials of priorities the White House wants them to keep on their radar. They oversee the arrival of new political appointees and coordinate with the West Wing on the agency’s direction.      The arrangement is collegial in some offices, including at Transportation and Interior, where aides to Chao and Secretary Ryan Zinke insisted that the White House advisers work as part of the team, attending meetings, helping form an infrastructure task force and designing policy on public lands.      Tensions between the White House and the Cabinet already have spilled into public view. Mattis, the defense secretary, and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly were caught unaware in January by the scope of the administration’s first travel ban. The president has been furious about leaks on national security matters.      Trump does not have long-standing relationships or close personal ties with most leaders in his Cabinet. That’s why gauging their loyalty is so important, said officials who described the structure.      “A lot of these [Cabinet heads] have come from roles where they’re the executive,” said a senior administration official not authorized to publicly discuss the White House advisers. “But when you become head of an agency, you’re no longer your own person. It’s a hard change for a lot of these people: They’re not completely autonomous anymore.”      Many of the senior advisers lack expertise in their agency’s mission and came from the business or political world. They include Trump campaign aides, former Republican National Committee staffers, conservative activists, lobbyists and entrepreneurs.      At Homeland Security, for example, is Frank Wuc o, a former security consultant whose blog Red Wire describes the terrorist threat as rooted in Islam. To explain the threat, he appears on YouTube as a fictional jihadist.      Matt Mowers, a former aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) who was Trump’s national field coordinator before landing at the State Department as senior adviser, said through a spokesman that he “leads interagency coordination” among the White House, agencies and the National Security Council and “coordinates on policy and personnel.”      Mowers sits at the edge of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s seventh-floor suite, dubbed Mahogany Row. But neither Tillerson nor his chief of staff are his direct boss.      Many of the advisers arrived from the White House with the small groups known as “beachhead teams” that started work on Jan. 20. One of the mandates at the top of their to-do list now, Bennett said, is making sure the agencies are identifying regulations the administration wants to roll back and vetting any new ones.      [Trump establishes task forces to eliminate ‘job killing regulations’]      At the Pentagon, Brett Byers acts as a go-between between Mattis’s team and the White House, largely on “bureaucratic” matters, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues.      Career officials who work near the “E” ring offices occupied by senior Pentagon staff, suspicious that Byers is not directly on Mattis’s team, came up with the Soviet-era moniker “commissar” to describe him, someone familiar with their thinking said.      Elsewhere, resentment has built up. Pruitt is bristling at the presence of former Washington state senator Don Benton, who ran the president’s Washington state campaign and is now the EPA’s senior White House adviser, said two senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.      These officials said Benton piped up so frequently during policy discussions that he had been disinvited from many of them. One of the officials described the situation as akin to an episode of the HBO comedy series “Veep.”      [How James Inhofe is upending the nation’s energy and environmental policies]      Trump’s approach may not be so different from Abraham Lincoln’s. Coming into the White House after more than a ­half-century of Democrats in power, Lincoln worked swiftly to oust hostile bureaucrats and appoint allies. But he still had to deal with an Army led by many senior officers who sympathized with the South, as well as a government beset by internal divisions.      Gettysburg College professor Allen C. Guelzo described Lincoln as “surrounded by smiling enemies,” which prompted him to embed his friends into army camps as well as some federal departments.      “I think that presidents actually do this more than it appears,” said Guelzo, adding that Lincoln dispatched Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army Montgomery Meigs to circulate among the Army of the Potomac to pick up any negative “doggerel” or insults officers made about him.

Trump was criticized for being slow to denounce a wave of anti-Semitism, did not mention Jews in his statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day and appointed Steve Bannon, who has been accused of making anti-Semitic comments, as his chief strategist.      But Trump ultimately denounced anti-Semitism and relates to American Jews by emphasizing that his daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, are Jewish.      Trump has taken some actions that signal he holds a strong pro-Israel stance. Before he took office, he denounced a U.N. resolution criticizing Israeli settlements on disputed land, condemned the Iranian nuclear deal and pledged to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He also appointed a U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who supports Israeli settlements.      But since taking office, he has cautioned President Benjamin Netanyahu to \\"hold off\\" on building new Israeli settlements, tempered his promise to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to visit the White House.      During Trump's time in office so far, encompassing a little less than two months, American Jews have given him a 31% job approval rating -- 11 percentage points below his overall average of 42% during the same period.      This below-average rating of the Republican president is not unexpected. The dominant predictor of how an American rates the president is partisan orientation, and Jews tilt heavily Democratic -- 64% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party (Jan. 20-March 15 data), while 29% identify with or lean toward the Republican Party.      Trump's 31% approval rating among Jews thus reflects this underlying partisan tilt, given that overall 84% of Republicans approve of Trump, compared with 10% of Democrats.      In the last year of his administration, Jewish job approval of President Barack Obama was 65%, about 13 points above his overall national adult average of 52%. This 13-point differential between Jewish and overall Obama approval was the same as observed across his entire administration.      So far, Trump's approval rating among Jewish Democrats -- the significant majority of all Jews -- is little different from his rating among Democrats overall: Both are very low. Trump's approval among the small number of Jewish Republicans in Gallup's samples so far during his term also appears little different from Republicans in general.      This suggests that Jews are reacting to Trump along party lines in about the same way as other partisans.      Trump has a significant opportunity to boost his image among Jews, Americans and the world. During the campaign, Trump talked about using his negotiating skills, and those of Kushner, to reach a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. If Trump accomplishes what his predecessors could not by negotiating a peace deal, this could certainly affect his approval rating not only among American Jews but among all national adults. ||||| By Dan Alexander, Chase Peterson-Withorn, Jennifer Wang and Daniela Sirtori-Cortina      The presidency has its perks, especially for someone with the business empire of Donald Trump. Since the election, initiation fees at his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, reportedly doubled to 200,000, penthouses in his Las Vegas tower are going for record prices, and guests paid as much as 18,000 a night to stay in his new Washington, D.C., hotel during the inauguration. Yet despite all of that, Forbes estimates that the president is worth 3.5 billion -- 200 million poorer today than he was before the election and 220 spots lower, to number 544, on our worldwide rankings.      That's because, at its core, the Trump Organization is still a midtown Manhattan real estate firm, albeit one with tentacles around the globe. Forty percent of Donald Trump's fortune is tied up in Trump Tower and eight buildings within one mile of it. What happens in that micromarket does more to affect the net worth of Donald Trump than anything else in the world. Lately, the neighborhood has been struggling (relatively speaking). Net operating profits have fallen at Trump Tower. Nike, the lone tenant at the Trump-owned Niketown, just signed a reported 700 million deal in December for a spot a few blocks south, suggesting its days at its current location may be numbered.      Trump’s cash pile took a hit as well. Public records show that he donated 66 million to his presidential campaign, 19% of its total budget. Ten days after he won the election, he settled a lawsuit over Trump University, which prosecutors say swindled millions from its students, for an additional 25 million. Assuming Trump sold off all of his stocks during last year’s campaign, as he has claimed, the president likely missed out on the “Trump rally” that has lifted the stock market roughly 10% since his election. The average billionaire saw his or her wealth grow by 16% since last year's Billionaires list; Trump's fell by 22% over that same time period.

In downtown Manhattan, the real estate market is experiencing something of a resurgence, driving up the value of Trump’s iconic 40 Wall Street tower by an estimated 18 million. Forbes estimates that the president’s favorite weekend getaway, Mar-a-Lago, is worth 25 million more since the election, partially thanks to a steady stream of headlines about the property that have given it more exposure than any realtor ever could. And the overall hotel market is up, fueling an estimated 97 million increase in the value of Trump’s hotel management and licensing business, even though the Trump Organization has promised to do no new foreign deals.

A former reality show contestant whose study of societal collapse inspired him to invent a bow-and-arrow-cum-survivalist multi-tool. A pair of healthcare industry lobbyists. A lobbyist for defense contractors. An “evangelist” and lobbyist for Palantir, the Silicon Valley company with close ties to intelligence agencies. And a New Hampshire Trump supporter who has only recently graduated from high school.      These are some of the people the Trump administration has hired for positions across the federal government, according to documents received by ProPublica through public-records requests.      While President Trump has not moved to fill many jobs that require Senate confirmation, he has quietly installed hundreds of officials to serve as his eyes and ears at every major federal agency, from the Pentagon to the Department of Interior.      Unlike appointees exposed to the scrutiny of the Senate, members of these so-called “beachhead teams” have operated largely in the shadows, with the White House declining to publicly reveal their identities.      While some names have previously dribbled out in the press, we are publishing a list of more than 400 hires, providing the most complete accounting so far of who Trump has brought into the federal government.      The White House said in January that around 520 staffers were being hired for the beachhead teams.      The list we obtained includes obscure campaign staffers, contributors to Breitbart and others who have embraced conspiracy theories, as well as dozens of Washington insiders who could be reasonably characterized as part of the “swamp” Trump pledged to drain.      The list is striking for how many former lobbyists it contains: We found at least 36, spanning industries from health insurance and pharmaceuticals to construction, energy and finance. Many of them lobbied in the same areas that are regulated by the agencies they have now joined.      That figure is almost certainly an undercount since we only included those who formally registered as lobbyists, a process increasingly avoided by many in Washington.      During the campaign, Trump said he would have “no problem” banning lobbyists from his administration. But they have nonetheless ended up in senior roles, aided by Trump’s weakening of Obama-era ethics rules that modestly limited lobbyists’ role in government.      The White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.      There are many former congressional staffers, several top officials from the George W. Bush administration, and even a handful of holdovers from the Obama administration. The list also includes at least eight staffers drawn from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that forged close ties to the new administration during the transition.      Much about the role of the beachhead teams at various federal agencies is unclear. But close observers of the early weeks of the Trump administration believe they have taken on considerable influence in the absence of high-level political appointees.      “If the public and Senate is in the dark about a team created without a Senate confirmation process, no one will be permitted to shed light on who is hopelessly conflicted or who is obviously unqualified — and who is both,” said Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.      The beachhead team members are temporary employees serving for stints of four to eight months, but many are expected to move into permanent jobs. The Trump administration’s model is based on plans developed but never used by the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Mitt Romney.      “The beachhead teams involve people with considerable authority over the federal government,” said Max Stier, the CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that advises presidential candidates on smooth transitions. “We need clarity about what they’re doing and what their role is going to be.”      The Obama administration also hired temporary staffers after the inauguration. But Trump has brought in many more, Stier said.      The new list of names was provided to us by the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency. We received additional names from other federal agencies in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. At least a few people on the list have changed agencies or left the administration, including, for example, the young Department of Housing and Urban Development staffer who was fired after his anti-Trump writings during the campaign came to light.      Here is a run-down of some of the Trump hires.      The Breitbart wing      Curtis Ellis was a columnist for WorldNetDaily, a website best known for its enthusiastic embrace of the false notion that President Obama was born outside the United States. A column headlined the “The Radical Left’s Ethnic Cleansing of America” won Ellis an admiring interview with Steve Bannon, now Trump’s top aide. He is a longtime critic of trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.      Ellis was hired Jan. 20 as a special assistant to the secretary at the Labor Department. Asked about his role in a brief phone interview Tuesday, he said: “Nothing I can tell you.”      Jon Perdue, a self-described guerrilla warfare expert and fellow at a little-known security think tank, wrote a book called “The War of All the People: The Nexus of Latin American Radicalism and Middle Eastern Terrorism.” He is also a onetime contributor to Breitbart.      Perdue was featured on CNBC’s reality series “Make Me a Millionaire Inventor” for his invention, the Packbow, which Perdue came up with while studying “collapsed societies, and what people who lived in those societies came up with to either defend themselves or to survive.” It’s a bow and arrow that doubles as a compass, tent pole, walking stick, spearfishing rig, and water purification tablet receptacle.      Perdue was hired as a special assistant at the Treasury Department. The agency didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.      John Jaggers ran the Trump campaign in Maryland and Virginia, where he made headlines for endorsing the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was “very, very sick and they’re covering it up.” As he put it last August: “The woman who seeks to be the first female president of the United States wears a wool coat at every single thing. Have you ever stopped to wonder why? It’s a big deal, folks.”      Jaggers was hired Jan. 20 as senior adviser at the General Services Administration, which oversees tens of billions of dollars of government procurement every year. But records show he left the job on March 3. He declined to comment.      Swamp denizens, including health care lobbyists hired by HHS Secretary Tom Price      Alexandra Campau, hired at the department of Health and Human Services, was formerly a lobbyist in Washington for the law firm Cozen O’Connor. According to disclosure records, her firm’s clients included a licensee of insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Fresenius Medical Care, a German company that specializes in medical supplies for renal dialysis.      Timothy Clark, a senior adviser to HHS Secretary Tom Price, ran his own political consulting firm in California. His past clients included PhRMA, the powerful trade group that represents the pharmaceutical industry.      Keagan Lenihan, also a senior adviser to Price, was a director of government relations at McKesson Specialty Health, a firm that supports independent health providers. Disclosure records show Lenihan directly lobbied HHS. For Lenihan, the new post represents a return trip through the revolving door between government and the private sector, and a reunion with an old boss. Before registering as a lobbyist, she was a senior legislative assistant for Price, when the now-HHS secretary was in Congress.      Asked about the three HHS staffers, an agency spokeswoman said: “We are not confirming or commenting on personnel at this time.”      Justin Mikolay, hired at the Department of Defense, was previously a registered lobbyist for Palantir. His title at the tech firm was “evangelist.” Mikolay lobbied for the “procurement/deployment of the Palantir Government software platform” throughout intelligence and defense agencies, according to disclosure records.      Mikolay was a speechwriter to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta between 2011 and 2013, according to his LinkedIn profile. Mikolay also previously served as a speechwriter for current Secretary of Defense James Mattis. He declined to comment.      Chad Wolf, a Bush-era Transportation Security Administration official turned lobbyist, is currently serving as an adviser to the TSA at the Department of Homeland Security. His clients have included defense and homeland security contractors.      Reached Tuesday, Wolf declined to comment. George Rogers, CEO of Wolf’s lobbying firm, Wexler Walker, told ProPublica that Wolf is currently on unpaid leave.      As we’ve previously reported, lobbyists for the construction industry trade association and financial services firm TransAmerica are on the team at the Department of Labor.      Trump campaign vets — including very young ones      The list also includes what appear to be dozens of former Trump campaign staffers, including several who graduated from college last year. One, Danny Tiso at the Department of Labor, graduated from high school in 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked for the Trump campaign in New Hampshire.      Seth Harris, who was on the first Obama-Biden transition team and later became a top Labor Department official, said it’s not uncommon to bring in campaign staff to agencies — “as long as there are senior political people to direct the junior people.”      “This is how you incorporate the people who are your strongest supporters into the government,” he said. “There are plenty of junior jobs in the government that these people can do — public-affairs jobs, special assistant jobs.”      Reporting was contributed by Robert Faturechi, Jesse Eisinger, Alison Gregor, Jessica Huseman, Lauren Kirchner, Alec MacGillis, Clifford Michel, T.

Here is a goal: how to keep fish from sticking to the pan Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? pick from the following. (A). use a fish spatula to flip (B). try to soak the fish for two days in salt water, and then cook in a wok.","output":"Both methods A and B have their merits, but after analyzing the possible outcomes, I can conclude that using a fish spatula to flip (method A) makes more sense to accomplish the goal of keeping fish from sticking to the pan. Here's a detailed explanation of why method A makes more sense: 1. Proper flipping technique: A fish spatula is a specially designed kitchen tool with thin slots and an angled shape to get underneath the delicate pieces of fish easily. Using a fish spatula to flip ensures you don't damage the fish during the cooking process, whereas flipping fish with other utensils can cause the fish to break apart or stick to the pan. 2. Appropriate cookware: Before cooking the fish, it is crucial to choose the right pan. Non-stick, stainless-steel, or cast-iron pans can be used, but it is necessary to make sure the pan is well heated with a thin layer of oil before adding the fish. Although cooking in a wok (method B) is possible, it may not be the optimal solution to prevent sticking, and using a wok can sometimes cause uneven cooking. 3. Proper preparation: Drying the fish thoroughly before seasoning helps ensure that it does not stick to the pan. This reduces the chances of moisture reacting with the oil and allowing the fish to adhere to the surface of the pan. In method B, soaking the fish in saltwater for two days might keep it moist, defeating any efforts to prevent sticking. 4. Heat and timing: Timing and heat play a vital role in preventing fish from sticking to the pan. Fish must be cooked at the right temperature to form a crust that helps it release from the pan easily. Generally, starting with high heat and then lowering the temperature after adding the fish works best. In addition, waiting for the fish to cook until it is ready to release easily from the pan ensures a perfect flip. 5. Application of oil or non-stick spray: A thin layer of oil spread evenly over the heated pan using a paper towel will prevent sticking. Non-stick sprays used in moderation are another option and can be used for both non-stick and stainless-steel pans. This step ensures a barrier between the fish and the surface of the pan that can help avoid sticking. In conclusion, using a fish spatula to flip the fish during cooking (method A) makes more sense to achieve the goal of keeping fish from sticking to the pan. This method focuses on the proper use of kitchen tools, proper fish preparation, appropriate cookware, and effective heat management. It is also more practical and less time-consuming than soaking fish in salt water for two days and cooking in a wok."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: A week after Election Day, three Republican governors mentioned as 2016 presidential candidates — Bobby Jindal, John Kasich and Bob McDonnell — each stopped by the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino to meet privately with its owner Sheldon Adelson, a man who could single-handedly underwrite their White House ambitions.      Planning a presidential campaign used to mean having coffee with county party chairs in their Iowa or New Hampshire living rooms. The courting of Adelson, a full four years out from 2016, demonstrates how super PAC sugar daddies have become the new must-have feature for White House wannabes.      Text Size -      +      reset Allen on 2016, donors Video: POLITICO on Super PACs      (Also on POLITICO: Megadonors seek low profiles)      And prospective candidates from both parties are wasting little time schmoozing potential super PAC funders.      Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is meeting with big donors in Los Angeles this week and has a fundraiser scheduled for next Monday in the Washington suburbs. Vice President Joe Biden, Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) have been meeting with big donors, leaving the impression that they’re ready to run.      “A group of five people could contribute 10 million each and finance a substantial primary campaign for a candidate,” said former South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges. “So there is probably more of an effort right now focused on trying to look at those people who are capable of being very large donors, rather than soliciting or developing the network of bundlers that were out there in the past.”      (PHOTOS: Republicans, 2016: In full swing)      Hodges, a Democrat, is co-hosting the fundraiser for O’Malley’s leadership PAC in Chevy Chase, Md., on Monday. He also raised money earlier this year for the PAC fronted by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and said he’d probably help other Democrats “who want to get out there and test the waters” by meeting with donors. “It’s an important part of a process.”      And it’s becoming more important, as demonstrated by the 2012 Republican primaries — the first since federal court decisions allowed super PACs to accept unlimited cash — which proved that a single super-rich supporter can essentially float an entire campaign. While the GOP establishment desperately tried to rally around eventual nominee Mitt Romney, super PACs funded by Adelson, Foster Friess and Jon Huntsman Sr. extended the challenges of Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman Jr. respectively, before a pro-Romney super PAC obliterated the field.      And in 2016 — with open primaries in both parties and the power of super PACs firmly established — the biggest donors are being courted earlier than ever. Not only are entreaties coming before most of the donors are anywhere close to choosing sides, none of the suitors are willing to discuss their plans publicly.      (See also: Dem super PACs jump on 2014, 2016)      Santorum is privately telling friends that he’s running again, POLITICO has learned. Friess, a retired mutual fund guru who donated 2.2 million to a pair of super PACs credited with helping lift Santorum to a surprise win over Romney in the Iowa caucuses, said, “Right now, I’m certainly still in his camp, but four years is a long way away.”      Adelson — a Las Vegas casino billionaire whose family donated a record 84 million or more to GOP outside groups, including 20 million each to the super PACs devoted to Romney and Gingrich — has signaled that he is undeterred from his weak 2012 return on investment and plans to continue giving big. ||||| WASHINGTON -- Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson vowed to spend as much as 100 million to defeat President Barack Obama and help the GOP take control of Congress. According to two GOP fundraisers with close ties to the Las Vegas billionaire, he made good on that promise -- and then some. Adelson ultimately upped the ante, spending closer to a previously unreported 150 million, the fundraisers said.      Adelson, a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign and domestic policies, has said that his humongous spending was spurred chiefly by his fear that a second Obama term would bring \\"vilification of people that were against him.\\" As that second term begins, Adelson's international casino empire faces a rough road, with two federal criminal investigations into his business.      This coming week, Adelson plans to visit Washington, according to three separate GOP sources familiar with his travel schedule. While here, he’s arranged Hill meetings with at least one House GOP leader in which he is expected to discuss key issues, including possible changes to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the anti-bribery law that undergirds one federal probe into his casino network, according to a Republican attorney with knowledge of his plans.      During the election, Adelson told Politico that the Justice Department investigation, and the way he felt treated by prosecutors, was a primary motivation for his investment in Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other GOP candidates. He put his money where his mouth was. The two GOP fundraisers, both with strong ties to Adelson, said that the casino mogul dished out close to 150 million, including between 30 million and 40 million to the Karl Rove-founded Crossroads GPS and at least 15 million to grassroots efforts with financial links to Charles and David Koch. Among other major beneficiaries of Adelson’s largess were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which received almost 5 million from Adelson, and the Republican Jewish Coalition, which got the bulk of its 6.5 million budget from him, the fundraisers said.      All of these are non-profit groups, which -- unlike the super PACs that raked in 54 million in funds from Adelson and his wife -- are not currently required to disclose their donors. Adelson’s public spending spree, larger than any other donor's in the last election, was made possible by two high court rulings in early 2010 that allowed corporations, unions and individuals to write unlimited checks to outside groups for political ads and other activities backing candidates      The two fundraisers who provided information to The Huffington Post represented separate groups that each received seven-figure checks this year from Adelson. The fundraisers learned details of Adelson’s spending plans about a month prior to the election: one heard of them in a talk with the casino owner himself, while the other didn’t indicate if his information came from Adelson or a top aide to the billionaire. Both requested anonymity to protect their ties to Adelson and because they were not authorized to speak publicly about his giving.      Adelson’s hefty support for Rove’s GPS made sense, said a third fundraiser who knows both men, because of their long-standing links. Adelson forged good ties with Rove after he served as deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush and this year they bonded further. Rove spent much of the last night of the Republican National Convention hanging out in a skybox suite with Adelson and other politicos and friends, and Rove also provided the casino mogul occasional advice on potential donations -- at least once undercutting another group seeking Adelson funding, said the two GOP fundraisers.      Rove, who also provided advice in 2008 to the Adelson-backed dark money group Freedom’s Watch, was just one of several GOP politicos with shadow party links that Adelson schmoozed and brainstormed with in Tampa. Long known as a hands-on donor who likes to immerse himself in details, Adelson had a crowded convention schedule. For instance, he spent time one afternoon meeting with leaders of several groups that he’d either already helped, or was considering writing more big checks to for their electoral drives.      Among the political heavies Adelson met with that afternoon were Sean Noble, a leading operative for the Koch brothers, and Carl Forti, a key political strategist for both Crossroads GPS and its affiliate American Crossroads. Forti is also a strategist for pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future, which received 20 million from Adelson and his wife Miriam, an Israeli-born doctor.      Earlier in the year, Adelson indicated at different times that he planned to spend about 100 million or “as much as it takes” to defeat Obama and help Republicans in Congressional races. Adelson’s personal wealth has been pegged at 20.5 billion by Forbes, making him one of the world’s richest men and enabling him to open his checkbook wide without worrying much about his bottom line.      Adelson’s largess appeared to have an impact on Romney’s campaign strategy. After Adelson publicly suggested that Romney sometimes waffled in his stances and wasn’t as ideologically consistent as his original pick, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, he and Romney met in late May in Las Vegas. Shortly afterwards, the casino owner’s first 10 million donation to Romney’s allied super PAC arrived.      Not long after their meeting, Romney restated his support for one of Adelson’s top priorities -- his fervent backing of Israel’s conservative government and his opposition to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Romney’s first foreign trip after his meeting with Adelson included a late July visit to Israel, which included a Jerusalem fundraiser that Adelson famously attended.      Now after what was largely a disappointing election for Adelson, his Las Vegas Sands casino empire could be facing heightened legal and political headaches. His sprawling operations are still mired in two wide-ranging federal criminal probes. Neither probe is said to be focused on Adelson’s conduct.      The Sands did not return several phone calls seeking comment for this piece.      In one inquiry, federal officials are looking into potential money laundering by two shady high rollers at his Las Vegas casinos. Settlement talks with Justice officials were under way in late October, according to the Wall Street Journal.      The money laundering investigation, led by the U.S. attorney for Los Angeles, is probing whether the casino broke the law by failing to report to the government millions of dollars of potentially laundered funds that two gamblers transferred to its casinos.      One of the two gamblers, Ausaf Umar Siddiqui, is being probed about over 100 million of his transactions through the casinos. Separately, he was arrested in 2009 and pleaded guilty to accepting illegal kickbacks in his job as an executive with Fry’s Electronics in California. He is now serving a six-year jail term.      The other big gambler in the probe is Zhenil Ye Gon, a Chinese-born Mexican-based businessman, who reportedly transferred 85 million to Sands casinos several years ago. Ye Gon was indicted in 2007 for dealing in illegal drugs, but the charges were dismissed in 2009.      Meanwhile, another inquiry by Justice and the SEC has been under way for about two years. It involves allegations that Adelson’s lucrative casinos on the Chinese island of Macau may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by paying bribes to Chinese officials to expand its operations there. The lion’s share of Sands' corporate revenues now come from Macau, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal, and a Singapore casino.      Among the payments that Justice has been probing are 700,000 that went to a local attorney, Leonel Alves, who was hired by the Sands Chinese subsidiary while he was a government legislator in Macau. The Justice probe apparently grew out of a wrongful termination lawsuit by Steven Jacobs, the former president of the Sands operation in Macau who has been cooperating with Justice.      Jacobs' suit alleged that he was fired after numerous clashes with Adelson over \\"Adelson’s illegal demands.\\" Adelson has flatly rejected Jacobs’ allegations and has said that \\"none of what he says is true and he can't prove it.\\"      A Sands spokesman has said repeatedly that the company has been cooperating with Justice and has done nothing wrong.            Ryan Grim contributed reporting      Also on HuffPost: ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In this article, three Republican governors who were considering running for president in 2016 met with Sheldon Adelson, a very rich man and owner of a big hotel and casino. They met because he could give them a lot of money to help their campaigns to become president. This shows how important it is for people who want to be president to have the support of rich people who can donate a lot of money to their campaigns. This has become even more important because of a court decision that allowed groups called super PACs to accept a lot of money from rich donors.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride. I still tear up every morning when I awaken and see her sleeping beside me. Peace According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Because there was a time, not so very long ago -- a time remembered vividly by many living Americans -- when the sign would not have raised eyebrows, much less warranted national headlines.

For those who commented on The Patriot as being accurate, (Which basically satanised the English), it was interesting to see this film. By all accounts this was the bloodiest war that Americans have ever been involved in, and they were the only nationality present. It was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not paint America as either martyrs or saviours. All in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict, and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. This was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"To determine the sentiment of this review, let's analyze its content step-by-step: 1. The review starts by comparing this film to another film (\\"The Patriot\\") and noting that the historical accuracy is appreciated since it doesn't demonize the English.     - This is a positive sentiment towards the film's accuracy. 2. The author highlights the fact that it shows Americans in a brutal war in which they were the only nationality involved.     - This part seems neutral, merely stating a fact about the content of the film. 3. The reviewer then remarks that the film is refreshing in its portrayal of historical accuracy and not painting America in a purely positive light.     - This is another positive sentiment about the film's approach to storytelling. 4. The review emphasizes the film's portrayal of the horrors of war and how violence begets more violence.     - This sentiment is neutral but might be seen as leaning towards positive, as it acknowledges the film's ability to convey the grim realities of war. 5. The reviewer remarks that this is not a film where you cheer any side, but instead pity and loathe all the characters involved.     - This statement is somewhat mixed, as it could be seen both as a positive sentiment (pity and loathing can be powerful emotional responses to the film's content) and a negative sentiment (since it implies the characters are not likeable). Considering these points, the sentiment of this review is mixed but leans towards positive. The review praises the film for its historical accuracy and unflinchingly honest portrayal of the brutality of war, while also acknowledging that it doesn't evoke cheering for any side."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The visual arts contribute nearly 90 million to the country's GDP and provide employment to almost 18,000 people, according to the Department of Arts and Culture. But the craft sector is even more significant when it comes to generating income. The sector contributes about 985 million annually to GDP and employs approximately 38,000 people. South Africa's government is trying to build on these areas with its Public Art Program. Minister of Arts and Culture Paul Mashatile has announced a number of partnerships with local community leaders and artists in a bid to stimulate creativity in communities and help beautify areas. Overall, the program is projected to create 5,000 short-term jobs between 2013 and 2015. One person who is well-aware of the economic potential South African design has to offer is Trevyn McGowan. The company she started with her husband, \\"Source,\\" is all about finding local designers and getting them started in the global market. \\"Our design industry is ready,\\" says McGowan, who's also the founder of the Southern Guild -- a stable of local talent creating design art and investment pieces. \\"A cool market, but in a commercial environment.\\" Design legacy. Her goal is to stimulate the industry and the majority of the work is happening in Woodstock. The regeneration of the area is one of the reasons that the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design has crowed Cape Town the World Design Capital -- a title the city will hold until the end of the year. Past title holders that have received recognition for driving urban development through design include Finland's capital city Helsinki and Seoul in South Korea. Cape Town is the first city on the African continent to have been given the title, which was first bestowed on Torino in Italy in 2008. But has the title led to real benefits for the city? \\"There has been a fantastic response,\\" says Otten. \\"There has been an uplifting of the city as people are really making public spaces better.\\" But there is a sense that the real benefits won't be immediately obvious. \\"I think this is far more intrinsic and deeper than anybody anticipates and it's only going to be in years to come that we really see the critical impact that world design capital has had on Cape Town,\\" says McGowan. \\"It's all very well to want the proof right here and right now but for a young industry, we're really are doing the best we can and the legacy that's going to be left behind after the year is over.\\" This longer-term perspective is also on the mind of Alayne Reesberg, CEO of World Design Capital Cape Town -- the body which implements the requirements of the World Design Capital organization. \\"There has been added impetus in 2014 for South African policy-makers to talk about design,\\" she says. \\"City, provincial and national government agencies are convening on design issues and the WDC title has really accelerated those conversations.\\" As the end of 2014 comes into sight, and with it the close of Cape Town's reign as World Design Capital, citizens will hope the year in the spotlight will have a lasting impact on the city's public spaces.

What are highlight points for this article?","output":"In Cape Town, old workshops and warehouses are being turned into creative spaces for artists, designers, and musicians. This is happening especially in the Woodstock neighborhood, where places like the Old Biscuit Mill have been transformed into busy retail areas with craft stores, art markets, theaters, and restaurants. The arts and crafts sector is important to South Africa's economy, providing jobs and contributing to the country's GDP. Because of this regeneration, Cape Town was named the World Design Capital for 2014, and the city hopes that this title will have a lasting impact on its public spaces."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Once there is a boy in London.

Information:  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - New Ireland Province, formerly New Mecklenburg, is the most northeastern province of Papua New Guinea.  - Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Lihir Island (a.k.a. Niolam Island) is the largest island in the Lihir group of islands, 22 km long and 14.5 km wide, in Papua New Guinea's New Ireland Province. It consists of a complex of several overlapping basaltic stratovolcanoes rising 700 m above sea level. While the volcanoes are not currently active, geothermal activity is still present. The island is in what was the forearc basin associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North Bismarck Plate. Subduction stopped about 10 million years ago with the collision of the Ontong Java plateau with the subduction zone.  - Subduction is a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced or sinks due to gravity into the mantle. Regions where this process occurs are known as \\"subduction zones\\". Rates of subduction are typically in centimeters per year, with the average rate of convergence being approximately two to eight centimeters per year along most plate boundaries.  - Lihir Island Airport is an airport in Londolovit on Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea . The airport has a short unpaved runway long enough to handle a small jet . All flights leave at approximately 4 - 7am . The airport has significantly upgraded its facilities , which now includes air conditioning , x-ray machines and a renovated waiting area . It is assumed that this is because of the introduction of a new international flight to Cairns , Australia , operated by Airlines PNG .  - The North Bismarck Plate is a small tectonic plate located in the Bismarck Sea off the northeast coast of New Guinea.  - Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania (and occasionally Australasia) extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji.  - The Pacific Plate is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. At , it is the largest tectonic plate.  - Papua New Guinea (PNG  Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.  - A forearc is the region between an oceanic trench and the associated volcanic arc. As such, forearc regions are found at convergent margins, and include any accretionary wedge and forearc basin that may be present. Due to tectonic stresses as one tectonic plate rides over another, forearc regions are sources for great thrust earthquakes   - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is a huge oceanic plateau located in the south-west Pacific Ocean, north of the Solomon Islands. The OJP was emplaced 120 Ma with a much smaller volcanic event 90 Ma. Two other south-west Pacific plateaus, Manihiki and Hikurangi, now separated from the OJP by Cretaceous ocean basins, are of similar age and composition and probably formed as a single plateau and a contiguous large igneous province together with the OJP. When emplaced this Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi plateau covered 1% of Earth's surface and represented a volume of of basaltic magma. This \\"Onotong Java event\\", first proposed in 1991, represents the largest volcanic event of the past 200 million years, with a magma emplacement rate estimated at up to /year over three million years, several times larger than the Deccan Traps. The smooth surface of the OJP is punctuated by seamounts such as the Ontong Java Atoll, the largest atoll in the world.  - In 2000 it had a population of 254,158. it had a population of 364,145, giving it an annual growth rate of 2.1% over a nine-year period. The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first European to see it was Captain John Moresby in 1873.

Entailment in linguistics and logic is when the truth of one statement or proposition guarantees or brings about the truth of another statement. In this case, both sentences are making contradictory claims about the subject's level of professionalism.

The negative assertion \\"not very\\" indicates that the subject falls short of what is expected or considered to be professional. On the other hand, the second sentence states that \\"it looks very professional.\\" This suggests that the subject does, indeed, meet or exceed the standards of professionalism in appearance. The positive assertion \\"very\\" emphasizes the high degree of professionalism demonstrated by the subject. Since these sentences express conflicting opinions on the same subject, the truth of one sentence does not guarantee or bring about the truth of the other.

He gave his life for his children.","output":"No, the word \\"give\\" is not used in the same way in these two sentences. The context and meaning of \\"give\\" differs significantly in each sentence. Let's discuss each one separately to understand the variations. 1. \\"This material doesn't give.\\" In this sentence, \\"give\\" is used to describe the flexibility or elasticity of a material. It means that the material does not stretch, bend, or change shape easily when force or pressure is applied to it. In this context, \\"give\\" acts as an intransitive verb expressing an inherent property or quality of the material. The sentence is discussing the material's capacity to stretch or expand. 2. \\"He gave his life for his children.\\" In this sentence, \\"gave\\" (the past tense form of \\"give\\") is used to describe the act of sacrificing or relinquishing something valuable for the benefit of others. \\"He\\" refers to a person who sacrificed his life (a valuable and ultimate sacrifice) for the well-being or protection of his children. In this context, \\"give\\" acts as a transitive verb, indicating an action that has a direct object, which is \\"his life\\" in this case. The focus here is on the act of self-sacrifice for the benefit of others. In conclusion, the two sentences use the word \\"give\\" in different ways, with distinct meanings and contexts. In the first sentence, \\"give\\" describes the lack of flexibility or elasticity of a material, while in the second sentence, \\"give\\" denotes the act of sacrificing or relinquishing something valuable for the benefit of others.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"The region of France would classify mangas under which term?\\"  Context: \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of European comics studies and French theory, the term \\"mangas\\" would be classified under \\"les littératures dessinées,\\" which translates to \\"drawn literatures.\\" This term encompasses various forms of comics and graphic narratives, including manga, which originated in Japan but has gained significant popularity in France and other European countries. The term highlights the combination of visual and textual elements that characterize manga, similar to other forms of comics and graphic novels.

Three days later, Soviet militsiya officer Arkady Renko (William Hurt) investigates the discovery of their bodies a short distance from the skating rink. All have been shot in the chest and mouth; their faces and fingerprints have been completely removed. Renko is left anxious and paranoid when the KGB refuse to take over the investigation. Renko enlists the help of Professor Andreev (Ian McDiarmid) to reconstruct their faces. At a weekend getaway at the dacha of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy (Ian Bannen), Renko makes the acquaintance of the American sable importer Jack Osborne (Lee Marvin) and his girlfriend Irina Asanova (Joanna PacuÅa). During his investigation, Renko crosses paths with William Kirwill (Brian Dennehy), a New York detective who is in the Soviet Union investigating the disappearance of his brother James. Renko is eventually able to piece together the victims' identities: James Kirwill, and two young Russians who were friends of Irina. He discovers that the three were busy constructing a chest for Osborne. Renko's suspicion of Osborne mounts over time, during their polite but tense conversations in social settings. When Irina is attacked by a KGB officer who attempts to inject her with a fatal overdose, Renko saves her. Nursing her back to health in his apartment, they begin an affair. Kirwill finally locates the barn where the three victims were building Osborne's chest. It was designed to smuggle six sables out of the country and to break the Soviet monopoly on their fur, potentially earning Osborne millions. Irina stubbornly continues to believe that her friends are alive. Osborne had promised to smuggle them out of Soviet Union in return for their work; he tells Irina that they were successfully freed.

She is looking for interesting rocks, and a foot down into the soil, discovers a fossilized fish skeleton. From this discovery, the woman is able to determine that OPTIONS: (I) the mountain used to be underwater (II) some bears in mountains eat fish (III) some fish can climb mountains (IV) sometimes rain can move fish to high spaces","output":"The fossils of a water animal or plant can indeed provide crucial information about the environmental history of a region. If the woman on the mountain finds a fossilized fish skeleton, it could have significant implications for understanding the geographical history of the location. Option I: The mountain used to be underwater This is the most likely explanation for finding a fossilized fish skeleton on a mountain. Geological processes, occurring over millions of years, often lead to the formation of mountains through tectonic activity. Likewise, the Earth's crust experiences several shifts during its existence, causing areas formerly under an ocean or sea to rise and become mountains. The presence of fish fossils would suggest that the area was once covered in water and likely part of a marine ecosystem. The fish lived and died in that environment, and their remains became encased in sediment, eventually forming a fossil. As uplifting of the Earth's crust occurred, the area that once was a marine habitat rose and turned into a mountain. Option II: Some bears in mountains eat fish While it's true that some bears, especially grizzly bears and black bears, eat fish as part of their diet, the presence of a fish skeleton buried underground on a mountain would not necessarily be indicative of this behavior. Bears typically chase and catch fish in water bodies like rivers or lakes, but their feeding activities wouldn't lead to the fossilization of fish many years later. Therefore, this option cannot be concluded merely from the discovery of the fossil. Option III: Some fish can climb mountains There are no known fish species that can climb mountains, as fish are adapted to live and thrive in aquatic environments. While certain fish, like the Pacific salmon, may swim long distances and up waterfalls to reach their mating sites, none of them possess the capability to climb mountains in the traditional sense. The presence of a fossilized fish skeleton on a mountain would not support this theory. Option IV: Sometimes rain can move fish to high spaces Although it's true that extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, can occasionally transport fish to unprecedented heights, it's unlikely that this would result in the fossilization of fish on a mountain. Moreover, these events are rare and the conditions required for fossilization would not typically be met in such cases. Hence, finding a prehistoric fossilized fish skeleton would not point to rain moving fish to high spaces. In conclusion, the woman's discovery of the fossilized fish skeleton on the mountain suggests that option (I) the mountain used to be underwater is the most plausible explanation. This indicates that the region underwent significant geological and environmental changes in the past, resulting in the mountain's formation and preserving the remains of the once-marine ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Hi I like this game but I didn't know how to install the games CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE GAMES THANK YOU.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of   your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints   due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take action that helps to bring back the heartbeat and breathing.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Question: \\"What are three causes of the Arawak's population decline?\\" Answer: \\"Oppression by the Spanish, European diseases and suicide\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, this answer is correct.

With an estimated 400,000 residents, the Okanagan Country spans from the Thompson Plateau near Grindrod, British Columbia in the Okanagan to the Okanagan Highland near Douglas County, Washington in the Okanogan. The largest city in the Canadian portion is Kelowna, with 117,312 residents as of 2011, while the largest city in the American portion is Omak, with 4,881 residents as of 2011. The region took its current name in honor of the Okanagan term, \\"uknaqín\\". The mild climate and close proximity to lakes, rivers and mountainous regions make the Okanagan Country an outdoor recreational destination. The region's economy is dominated by the primary industries of agriculture and forestry, although economic diversification has also occurred with retirement communities and recreational tourism. The American portion is considered to be more remote than the Canadian division, with approximately 10 percent of the population.  - Yale - East was a provincial electoral district in the British Columbia legislature that appeared only in the 1894 , 1898 and 1900 elections .

Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores.  - Niko Nirvi ( born 1961 ) is a long - term major icon in the Finnish gaming world . He is well known for writing computer game reviews since the 1980s in MikroBitti , C = Lehti and the computer game yearbooks that were predecessors of the Pelit magazine . He has worked for the latter since its founding in 1992 , and holds a column in addition to making reviews and other reports . Nirvi began his career as a game reviewer in 1986 on pages of MikroBitti . He had made a bet with his friend that he could get his review published in the magazine . He sent two reviews , Zoids and Uridium and the former was published ( they already had one Uridium review ) . Nirvi wrote reviews and a regular column about new games for Mikrobitti and became the \`\` game editor '' of the magazine . He also wrote reviews for C = Lehti . When Pelit , that concentrated solely on gaming , was founded by the same publisher , Nirvi joined its ranks as an editor , and has written a regular column for each issue . Trademarks of his are signing with \`\` Nnirvi '' or a variation , and never showing his face in the magazine . Photos of him are always either covered or edited in a way that the face is unrecognizable . His personal picture in his articles is usually a gaming or movie character whose face is blurred ( for example Master Chief ) while the rest of the crew 's articles feature their real faces . Wallu 's drawings of Nirvi depict him as a bearded man with Spock 's Vulcan ears . According to Nirvi , his avoidance of publicity started in 1988 , when a MikroBitti reader asked for a photograph of him , which Nirvi instantly declined , and this avoidance has strengthened ever since . Nirvi 's style is typically humorous , and sometimes unorthodox . Some of Nirvi 's most unconventional reviews were published in C = Lehti . The review of Domark 's motorboat game Hydra was written as a nursery rhyme from the beginning to the end . The review of Battle Island contained just two words : '' Paska Commando - klooni . \`\` ( '' shitty Commando clone \`\` ) .  - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \\"departments\\".

Question: What is Maurice's profession? Movie title: Venus Movie plot: The plot concerns Maurice Russell, an elderly actor who finds himself increasingly attracted to his friend Ian's grand-niece Jessie while simultaneously finding himself in deteriorating health due to prostate cancer. Maurice's friend describes the grand-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego VelÃ¡zquez. Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as \\"yodelling\\") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname \\"Venus\\". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have. The plot comes to a head when Jessie becomes involved with a boy. The two young lovers...

Richards IV was convicted of rape, the wealthy heir to the du Pont family fortune was spared prison by a Delaware court in 2009 because he would \\"not fare well\\" behind bars, according to court documents CNN obtained Tuesday.  Richards is a great-grandson of the chemical magnate Irenee du Pont.  He received an eight-year prison sentence in 2009 for raping his toddler daughter, but the sentencing order signed by a Delaware judge said \\"defendant will not fare well\\" in prison and the eight years were suspended.  Richards was placed on eight years' probation and ordered to get treatment and register as a sex offender, the documents show. He was also prohibited from having contact with children under 16, including his own children.  The documents were never sealed, yet the ruling managed to go unnoticed until March, when Richards' former wife, Tracy Richards, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Superior Court on behalf of their children alleging \\"personal injuries arising from the childhood sexual abuse.\\" The 11-page suit alleges that not only was their daughter abused, but Richards abused their son, too. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages.  While he was convicted of raping his daughter, Richards has never been charged with sexually molesting his son, according to Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Delaware attorney general's office.

Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has called on fans to use social media to name and shame anyone caught throwing coins following incidents during the club's last two home games against Newcastle and Liverpool. The Eagles will upgrade their security measures this weekend for the visit of Arsenal in the hope that they can put a halt to the incidents seen in the last fortnight. As well as more cameras situated around the ground, some stewards will wear body cameras in attempt to get a clearer view of potential culprits. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has called on the club's supporters to name and shame via social media. Newcastle players celebrate their opener at Selhurst Park as Fabricio Coloccini is struck in the face. Crystal Palace have vowed to ban anyone found guilty of throwing coins from the ground for life. Coloccini played the full 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw but John Carver raged he could have been blinded. And Pardew insists that fans should upload pictures of rule-breakers to social media. 'The incident with Chelsea in Paris gives you the strength of social media. So if any fans are next to someone [behaving inappropriately] then film them. Let's have a picture of them and we'll try and do our best to find them. 'We represent society at all levels, we get all types of our society here and we can't control their behaviour to a degree. 'All we can do is put on the best environment and most children-friendly environment we possibly can. We've got the best atmosphere in the country and we don't want to lose that with silly little incidents that have come, and I don't want to keep going on about it. 'Those few citizens that are letting us down, we need to reel them in and point them out to us.' The south London club have launched investigations in two separate incidents of objects being thrown onto the pitch. Coloccini points to the coin thrown at him (left) as Papiss Cisse celebrates his 10th goal of the season. Stewards look for any objects thrown on to the pitch at Selhurst Park as one finds a coin on the turf. The first saw Newcastle defender Fabricio Collocini hit with a coin during the 1-1 draw last week as the Magpies celebrated going ahead, the second occurred after Daniel Sturridge equalised for Liverpool in last Saturday's FA Cup tie. And the Eagles have invested in upgrading their CCTV equipment following the incidents that marred both matches ahead of Saturday's visit of Arsenal. The club are also exploring tactical security measures they can take when opposition scores to prevent further incidents.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The rubbing alcohol will preserve the body of the insect and prevent it from decaying, drying out, or breaking into pieces. The jar should be larger than the insect, but not unnecessarily so. If you put a small insect in a large jar, you’ll waste rubbing alcohol.  Most rubbing alcohol is a 70% solution—this should work well for preserving your insects. Stronger rubbing alcohol—at 80 or 85%--is also appropriate, as some insects are better preserved with a stronger alcohol.  Examples of insects that should be preserved in stronger alcohol include: spiders, scorpions, earthworms, and small insects including lice and silverfish.  Make sure that the glass jar has a tight-fitting lid, and does not have any cracks. Keep in mind that soft-bodied insects are most commonly preserved in alcohol. The insect could come from anywhere: a window inside your house, the environment near where you live, or even from a nearby spider’s web. You’ll want to preserve an insect that is still in decent shape. If the insect has been dead for days and is already decaying and breaking apart, preserving it will be less effective. You can also trap insects yourself through a variety of methods: for example, catching moths and butterflies in a butterfly net. While some would object to the ethics of killing insects simply to preserve them, traps are an effective way to make sure you have dead insects available. When preserving insects, it’s important to know which specific species you are dealing with. This is an especially important part of the procedure if you are preserving insects for scientific purposes. The label should include: the genus and species of the insect, the date and location on which the insect was found, and the name of the collector. Tape the completed label to the outside of the alcohol-filled jar. There are many helpful websites that can help you identify the dead insect. Start by checking BugGuide.net or InsectIdentification.org. If these sites aren’t helpful, try to contact a local entomologist. Be delicate, and handle the insect carefully: its body will be very fragile and could easily be crushed. It’s best if you handle the insect with forceps or a pair of tweezers, as your fingers could break or damage part of the insect. If the insect has a stinger (bees, wasps) or is otherwise poisonous, wear latex gloves when handling the body. Only do this once the body of the insect has settled to the bottom of the jar. Pour the rest of the alcohol in slowly. If you pour too fast, the liquid may damage or break the insect’s body.  Close and seal the jar, then store it in a safe location. If you’re planning on starting a large insect collection, it may be prudent to dedicate an entire tabletop to the jars. Store the insect jars far from food, children, and animals.","output":"The article provides detailed instructions on how to preserve insects in rubbing alcohol, emphasizing the selection of appropriate insects, the use of the correct alcohol strength for specific species, proper handling and labeling, and safe storage to maintain the specimens in good condition and prevent potential hazards."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Questions: Billy often eat hamburgers, but he did not always have then with cheese.  Billy are cheeseburgers more often than some people, but less often than others.  You could say that it was something he did only when? Options: - occasionally - seldom - hardly ever - infrequently - never Answer:","output":"The most appropriate answer to the question based on the given information is: occasionally.  Explanation: Firstly, it is important to analyze the information given about Billy's eating habits. We know that Billy often eats hamburgers, which means he has them on a regular basis. However, he does not always have them with cheese. Additionally, it is mentioned that Billy eats cheeseburgers more often than some people but less often than others, which signifies that his consumption of cheeseburgers falls somewhere in the middle when comparing his eating habits with others. Now, let's decipher each of the given options: 1. Occasionally: This term suggests that something happens from time to time, but not very regularly or frequently. It is not a completely rare event but also not a daily habit. 2. Seldom: This term indicates that something happens very infrequently or barely ever. It implies rarity or an extremely low frequency of occurrence. 3. Hardly ever: Very similar to seldom, this term means that something happens very rarely or almost never. 4. Infrequently: This term refers to an event happening at irregular intervals or not occurring often, indicating a lower frequency. 5. Never: This term implies that something does not happen at all or has a zero frequency of occurrence. Out of these given options, \\"occasionally\\" seems to be the most suitable answer based on the information provided about Billy's cheeseburger-eating habits. Since he does not always have hamburgers with cheese, but still enjoys cheeseburgers more often compared to some people, it can be concluded that he eats them on an occasional basis. Neither too frequent nor very rare, this choice falls right in the middle, aligning with our understanding of Billy's preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The discovery of the wreckage, first spotted by a Nepalese army helicopter Friday, followed days of intense search involving U.S. and Nepalese aircraft and even U.S. satellites.      The U.S. relief mission was deployed soon after a magnitude-7.8 quake hit April 25, killing more than 8,200 people. It was followed by another magnitude-7.3 quake on Tuesday that killed 117 people and injured 2,800.      The second quake was centered between Kathmandu and Mount Everest, and hit hardest in deeply rural parts of the Himalayan foothills, hammering many villages reached only by hiking trails and causing road-blocking landslides. ||||| KATHMANDU The wreckage of a U.S. military helicopter lost on an earthquake relief mission in Nepal was found on Friday high on a mountainside, with all eight on board presumed dead, U.S. officials said.      A U.S. search team identified the wreckage as that of the missing Marines UH-1Y Huey helicopter deployed after the Himalayan state was hit by a massive earthquake last month that killed more than 8,000 people.      Crash debris was found 8 miles (13 km) north of the town of Charikot near dense forest and rugged terrain.      \\"It was a very severe crash. We believe there were no survivors,\\" said John Wissler, lieutenant general of the U.S. Marines.      The Huey went missing while it was distributing aid on Tuesday, the day a strong aftershock hit Nepal and killed more than 100 people.      Six Marines and two Nepali soldiers were on board when it went missing, after the crew was heard over the radio saying the aircraft was experiencing a fuel problem.      U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter mourned the loss of the Marines, and a Pentagon spokesman said U.S. officials were in touch with the families.      \\"This tragedy is a reminder of the vital but dangerous role that American servicemembers play in delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,\\" Carter said in a statement.      The Huey, an iconic helicopter dating back to the Vietnam War era, was completely destroyed, Nepal's top defence ministry official said earlier on Friday.      \\"As the helicopter has broken into pieces and totally crashed there is no chance of any survivors,\\" Nepal's defence secretary Ishwori Prasad Paudyal.      HUNDREDS IN SEARCH      After a three-day search the Huey was spotted near the village of Ghorthali at an altitude of 11,200 ft (3,400 m), an army general told Reuters earlier, as helicopters and Nepali ground troops converged on the crash site.      \\"It was found on a steep slope,\\" Major General Binoj Basnet said. U.S. and Nepali teams investigated the site on Friday in an attempt to determine the cause of the crash.      On Saturday, U.S. and Nepalese aircraft plan to get their rescue team back up to the site to collect the bodies and begin identification of the charred remains.      The area's tallest peak soars to more than 7,000 metres (23,000 ft). Hillsides are cloaked with lush forest that made it hard to find the chopper even though it came down just a few miles from Charikot, the capital of Dolakha district that lies half a day's drive to the east of Kathmandu.      An army base in the town has been serving as a hub for operations to airlift and treat those injured in the two earthquakes, and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala flew in on Thursday for an on-the-spot briefing.      The first quake, which struck on April 25 with a magnitude of 7.8, has killed 8,199 people. The death toll from a 7.3 aftershock on Tuesday has reached 117, with many victims in Dolakha.      The combined toll is approaching the number of just over 8,500 who died in an earthquake in 1934, the worst natural disaster on record to hit Nepal.      Some 76,000 more have been injured, while hundreds of thousands of buildings, including ancient temples and monuments, have been damaged or destroyed. Nearly three weeks after the first quake, aftershocks continue to rattle the country.      Nepal mobilised 600 soldiers to search for the missing Huey.      Two more U.S. Hueys, two MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor planes, and Nepali and Indian choppers had been involved in the search for the helicopter, which was part of a joint task force sent in by the United States to provide assistance at Nepal's request.      U.S. officials said the crash would not affect ongoing relief operations.      \\"We will continue to stand by Nepal as long as they need our help,\\" Wissler told reporters.

The wreckage of the helicopter that disappeared this week while delivering aid near the Chinese border in Nepal was found on Friday morning.      Six US marines and two Nepali soldiers were on board. Three bodies have so far been recovered.      Tuesday's 7.3-magnitude quake killed at least 110 people.      It came as Nepal was reeling from the devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake of 25 April which killed more than 8,000 people and injured many more.      The editor of the Nepal Times, Kunda Dixit, said the helicopter wreckage was found 56km (35 miles) from Kathmandu.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The helicopter was delivering aid to the badly-hit village of Charikot      The helicopter went missing in the hours after the second quake.      Although the cause of the crash is not yet known, a nearby Indian helicopter heard radio chatter about a possible fuel problem, said Pentagon spokesman Steve Warren.      The marines had been working in the vicinity of Charikot, a village that was hit hard by the first quake, a spokesman for the US Pacific Command said.      The helicopter had been flying from Kathmandu airport as part of the US Operation Sahayogi Haat, which means \\"helping hand\\" in Nepali.      More than a dozen US military aircraft have been deployed to help carry out deliveries to areas cut off by the earthquakes.      Two Nepalese army helicopters were deployed in the search for the missing UH-1Y Huey helicopter, as well as 400 troops on the ground. |||||Summary:","output":"A big earthquake happened in a country called Nepal.

A weight lifter is in a gym, and he lifts a barbell. he","output":"takes a few deep breaths, preparing for his next move. After successfully lifting the barbell and holding it for a moment, the weight lifter steadily brings the barbell back down to the safety of the squat rack or bench press, depending on the specific exercise he was performing. This action is an important component of proper weightlifting technique, as it allows the individual to maintain control over the weights, minimizing the risk of injury. Once the barbell is securely back on the rack, the weight lifter will likely take a few moments to catch his breath and evaluate his performance during the lift. He may check his form in a mirror or video recording, analyze any potential areas for improvement, and make mental notes for future reference. This brief period of reflection is crucial in the ongoing process of honing one's skills and increasing strength. Next, the weight lifter might choose to adjust the weight on the barbell based on his assessment of the previous lift. If he found the weight too easy, he may decide to add more weight plates to the barbell to further challenge himself. Conversely, if the previous lift was too challenging or his form was compromised, he may decide to reduce the weight. Either way, these adjustments serve to tailor the exercise to the individual's specific needs and goals. Assuming he has more sets remaining in his workout routine, the weight lifter would then typically rest for a predetermined period of time - often anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes - depending on the intensity of the exercise and his personal training program. Taking adequate rest between sets is important for allowing muscles to recover and for helping to prevent injury. During his rest period, the weight lifter might choose to stay active by stretching, hydrating, or intermittently performing other exercises targeting different muscle groups. This approach can maximize the efficiency of the workout and helps to maintain an elevated heart rate throughout the session. After the rest interval has passed, the weight lifter will return to the barbell to perform another set of the same exercise – again following proper form and technique to ensure both the effectiveness and safety of the movement. Once the weight lifter has completed all his planned sets for that particular exercise, he may then move on to the next exercise in his workout routine, repeating the process of lifting, evaluating, adjusting, resting, and staying active until all exercises have been completed. Lastly, when the weight lifter has finished his entire workout, he should take some time to cool down by performing gentle stretches or light cardio exercises. This cool-down period aids in muscle recovery, prevents injury, and promotes overall well-being. In conclusion, the most logical next event after a weight lifter lifts a barbell would be to safely lower the barbell back onto the rack, assess his performance, adjust the weight if necessary, rest for an appropriate interval, perform another set or move on to the next exercise, and finally, cool down once the workout is complete. By following this structured approach, the weight lifter can optimize his training results and minimize the risk of injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He said he was awakened at the crash site and saw their corpses on the ground. ||||| CARACAS, Venezuela -- Former major league players Luis Valbuena and Jose Castillo were killed in a car crash caused by highway bandits who then robbed them, officials said Friday.      The 33-year-old Valbuena and 37-year-old Castillo died late Thursday when their SUV crashed as it tried to veer around an object on the road, Yaracuy state governor Julio Leon Heredia said on his Twitter account.      Officials said some bandits place or throw objects on highways to force vehicles to stop or crash so they can rob the occupants. Heredia said four people have been detained after being found with property of the athletes.      Valbuena and Castillo were teammates on the Cardenales de Lara team in the Venezuelan winter league and were returning from a game in the capital when the crash occurred en route to the city of Barquisimeto.      Third baseman Carlos Rivero was in the car and survived, according to the website BeisbolPlay.

League president Juan Jose Avila told Union Radio that he was evaluating the possibility of forbidding players to travel in private cars to move between games, saying if the players had been on the team bus, \\"nothing would have happened to them.\\"      Venezuelan teams tend to travel in buses protected by security forces.      Dozens of Venezuelans waited in line outside a chapel in the state of Lara on Saturday, hoping to bid farewell to Valbuena. Castillo was moved earlier in the morning to a different central-west state.      Retired Cardenales player Robert Perez and Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera were both in attendance.      Rivero, the crash's lone survivor, visited the chapel wearing dark sunglasses and bearing a small bruise on his forehead.      Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. ||||| Luis Valbuena, the charismatic, bat-flipping third baseman who played an integral part on the Astros 2015 Wild Card team, died in a car accident following a winter ball game in his native Venezuela on Thursday along with former Astro Jose Castillo.      The news was confirmed by the Cardinals of Lara, a Venezuelan winter ball team for whom both men played a game on Thursday. Valbuena was 33 and Castillo was 37.      According to reports in Venezuela, the car transporting Valbuena and Castillo hit a rock in the road. Four men were arrested in connection with the accident, Julio Leon Heredia — the governor of Yaracuy — announced Friday afternoon.      Heredia told meridiano.com that the four men were found with some of Valbuena and Castillo's belongings. It is customary, Heredia said, for criminals or gangs to place large rocks in the middle of the street in hopes of either stopping or overturning vehicles to rob those inside.      We are so very deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former Astros players Luis Valbuena and Jose Castillo. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones. https://t.co/DsFivc3KgH pic.twitter.com/DQazSdUlZr — Houston Astros (@astros) December 7, 2018      Neither Valbuena nor Castillo was wearing a seatbelt. Both were ejected from the vehicle, according to on-site reports.      \\"The Astros family lost two young men yesterday, entirely too soon,\\" the organization said in a statement Friday morning. \\"During his two seasons in Houston, Luis was an extremely popular player with his teammates and the Astros staff. He was a productive player on the field and played a key role in the Astros run to the postseason in 2015. Off the field, he was a warm and friendly presence to all who interacted with him. Jose's time with the Astros was brief, but he also had a positive impact on those around him. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends.\\"      Former major league infielder Carlos Rivero survived the accident. The car was driven by Rivero's chauffeur, who also survived according to BeisbolPlay.com. The car was bound for Barquisimeto — a city in northwest Venezuela.      “This is a very sad day for our sport as we mourn the deaths of Luis Valbuena and José Castillo,\\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \\"It is clear by all the stories today that they loved baseball and made an impact on their teammates and the Clubs they represented. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to their families, friends and fans, particularly those in their native Venezuela.”      Acquired in a trade that sent Dexter Fowler to the Cubs, Valbuena appeared in 132 games and hit a career-high 25 home runs during the Astros’ 2015 season, the first under manager A.J. Hinch and the franchise’s first postseason appearance since 2005.      A versatile defender who played both first and third base, Valbuena became known for his pronounced bat flips following any successful plate appearance — even walks — and infectious smile which permeated the clubhouse.      Tributes poured in from Valbuena’s former Astros teammates on Friday morning. Jose Altuve, a Venezuelan, posted pictures of both men on Instagram with a Spanish caption saying “I can’t believe what’s going on.”      On Twitter, pitcher Collin McHugh called him “such a huge piece of our success story. Part of a lengthy Instagram post in Spanish from Marwin Gonzalez read “You left this world without an enemy because your principles, your kindness and your charisma would not let you have it.”      Absolutely devastated by the news of Luis’ passing. He was such a huge piece of our success story with the @astros...but more than that, he was a husband, father, teammate and friend. Rest easy, brother pic.twitter.com/WiVx0e1h6O — Collin McHugh (@Collin_McHugh) December 7, 2018      In a statement, Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow called Valbuena one of “the happiest players in baseball.”      “I will miss Luis’ banter, smile, genuine love for his teammates, and, of course, the bat flips,” Hinch said in a statement. “He was a beloved person whether he was on our team or across the field. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the lucky ones who could call him a teammate or friend.”      Valbuena slashed .224/.310/.438 in 2015 and started each of Houston’s six postseason games at third base. He hit a home run in the team’s Game 5, season-ending loss to the Royals in the American League Division Series.      In 2016, Valbuena seemed destined for another career season before sustaining a season-ending hamstring injury. In the 90 games prior to the injury, which required surgery, Valbuena knocked 13 home runs and hit .260.      Valbuena played 222 career games as an Astro.      “Luis was always smiling and was one of the happiest players in baseball,” Luhnow said. “He provided joy to his teammates and our fans. He helped our franchise turn a corner in 2015 and provided many cherished memories. We will forever remember him.”      The Angels signed Valbuena as a free agent following the 2016 season. He played all of 2017 and part of 2018 in Los Angeles before he was designated for assignment and released in August.      Castillo was a veteran of five major league seasons who ended his career with the Astros. The infielder, played 15 games in Houston before leaving for the Mexican League following the 2008 season. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Former Major League Baseball players Luis Valbuena and Jose Castillo were killed in a car crash in Venezuela on December 6, 2018.

Movie title: Source Code Movie plot: U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), last aware of being on a mission in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train[6] to Chicago, at 7:40 am. To the world around him â including his traveling partner Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and the bathroom mirror â he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit, leaking oil.

Wet your skin with warm water and gently rub it with a brush, gentle scrubber, or exfoliating product, such as an exfoliating cleanser. Rinse your skin with cool water and then pat it dry. Exfoliating will remove dead skin cells that would otherwise clog your razor. Dip your clean fingers into a jar of pure coconut oil and then rub your fingers together. The heat and friction of your fingers will soften the oil, making it easy to spread on the skin you're planning to shave. Let the oil sit on your skin for a few minutes before you begin to shave. If you're shaving your face or armpits, you'll only need a coin-sized amount of coconut oil. You'll need more to shave your legs, especially if the skin is very dry. Although you could shave with just the pure coconut oil on your skin, you'll get a smoother shave if you apply moisturizing shaving cream.

If you're shaving short hairs, you may want to skip the shaving cream since pure coconut oil will be enough to moisturize the fine hairs. the hair with a sharp razor.

News article: Photo      About this time, many spouses and children, including those who are grown, are hurrying to buy or create a gift for Mother’s Day.      I am here to say that my family can stand down this year. It may be too strong of a word to say I’m “boycotting” the whole thing, but I’m having second thoughts. So they shouldn’t worry about taking me out to brunch (with a crowd of other mothers) at a restaurant that has raised its prices for the day.      Not that there aren’t aspects of the holiday I don’t enjoy. One year, my girls (with help from my husband) gave me a ring with their names engraved on it. It’s the only piece of jewelry I wear regularly, besides my wedding ring. And when my children were in preschool, I delighted in their efforts to serve me breakfast in bed without spilling the juice. I still treasure their little handmade gifts — Who doesn’t tear up, at an imprint of a toddler handprint on a card for Mom? — and I look forward to their creations this year.      Nevertheless, I can’t help but see Mother’s Day is a bit of a relic, a holdover from a time when most mothers didn’t work outside the home, and most fathers helped out less with the housework and the children.      Insure.com, an insurance Web site, compiles a “Mom’s Value” index, computing the annual value of jobs done by mothers, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, if the family had to pay someone else to do them. (Example: “Cleaning up,” 5,135; Haircuts, 320; taking care of the children, 20,072.)      It’s entertaining to think that way, and certainly stay-at-home spouses deserve credit for all that they do. But most families I know work as a partnership. Sometimes, it’s the mother who stays home with the children, but it’s increasingly the father (and for male same-sex couples, it’s always a dad). Often both halves of the couple work outside the home, and they muddle through the household duties like grocery shopping, cooking, laundry and cleaning as best they can — together. Both are exhausted, much of the time.      The last thing my husband needs, after flying across the country on a business trip, is to feel guilty because he didn’t have time to buy me a bouquet of pricey, short-lived roses for a contrived holiday (although it’s true that I am, in fact, the family’s chief “summer activity planner” — valued at 7,704).      Even the founder of the modern American Mother’s Day, Anna Jarvis, eventually turned against the holiday. According to History.com, her efforts led to establishment of the holiday in 1914 — but she later disowned her creation. “Jarvis would later denounce the holiday’s commercialization and spent the latter part of her life trying to remove it from the calendar,” the site says.      Perhaps when my children are grown and living on their own, I’ll feel differently. I won’t be spending as much time with them. So I’ll likely jump at the chance to have brunch with them or receive flowers (or even a text message) from them.      But right now, what we really need in my family is a day off together, without an expensive agenda. To sleep late, read the paper, maybe go for a bike ride — if we feel like it. I know my children love me, because they show me their feelings on a regular basis, not just on one day a year.      What do you think? Do you think Mother’s Day is outdated? ||||| Yet The Fiscal Times projected 18 billion would be spent on Mother's Day last year. Folks are spending around 150 per mother on anything from cards and flowers to, according to Esquire's 50 Best Gifts To Buy for Mother's Day suggestions, perhaps this 180 Donna Karan robe or this 395 Tory Burch satchel?      Mother's Day has become to moms what Christmas is to kids: A perversion of the simple joy of honoring loved ones.      Lest I come across a bitter Mommy Scrooge, my husband has hit Mother's Day out of the park since my oldest—six—was tiny. Last year he corralled our three kids and managed to whip up homemade chocolate waffles and a goat cheese tart while I slept in. The day concluded with a picnic at a local winery (with 100 other moms and their families).      But I still think it's a stupid holiday and men—but especially women—are worse for it. For some men—obviously this isn't universal—like birthdays and anniversaries, it offers another opportunity for him to screw up. Not because he's inept but because he misunderstands or misjudges the magnitude of this holiday to the mothers in his life and nearly always under-delivers.      Most women don't want brunch with a crowd of strangers. They want their work as a mother, their joy as a mother, their pain as a mother, to be recognized, acknowledged and honored in a genuine and consistent way. According to Salary.com, the average stay at home mom works 94 hours a week. If she could collect a salary—doing a range of 6.2 hours of laundry and 14 hours of cooking and the like—she would earn around 113,568 per year. In addition to her 40-hour work week, a working mom puts in 58 hours' worth of household and childcare jobs a week, like 6 hours worth of a being a psychologist and 4.2 hours of janitorial work. If she collected a paycheck for the latter work, she would earn 67,435 per year.      Most moms would rather have dad take the kids on a walk so she can prepare dinner in peace or another set of hands during the evening homework crunch every day, rather than one day of, So honey, it's all about you today, you want pancakes or waffles in bed?

Adam was playing tag football when one of his friends tagged him a bit too hard and caused him to tumble and fall. He noticed when he fell, he got a pretty bad cut in his knee. He decided to ignore the injury for now and keep playing. Later when he got home he realized the area of the cut was warm and swollen  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will the blood flow to the area of an inflamed injury have increased or decreased?  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. A:","output":"Given the circumstances described in the paragraph, it can be inferred that the blood flow to the area of the inflamed injury – in this case, Adam’s wounded knee – will have increased. This increase in blood flow is a part of the body's inflammatory response, an integral part of the innate immune system that occurs in response to injuries or infections. When a wound occurs, such as the cut on Adam’s knee, the cells in the damaged tissue release chemicals in response to the incident. These chemicals serve several functions, one of which includes causing the nearby blood vessels to dilate or expand. The dilation or expansion of blood vessels, in turn, facilitates an increase in blood flow to the injury site. The increased blood flow to the injured area gives rise to noticeable signs of inflammation. One of these signs of inflammation includes redness, which results from the rush of blood to the damaged tissue. Added to this redness, the area may also feel warm or slightly heated, another result of the increased blood flow. Another sign is swelling, or edema, which is caused by accumulation of fluid, cells, and cellular debris. Furthermore, the chemicals that were released by the damaged cells also attract white blood cells - in particular a type called neutrophils - to the wound. These cells play a critical role in the immune response to injury by not only moving towards the concentration of the released chemical signals, but also by traversing the walls of the blood vessels, a process known as diapedesis, to enter the site of the injury in the tissue. Once at the site, these cells engage in the process of phagocytosis, ingesting and breaking down the pathogens or debris present at the site. This action helps to prevent infection and promotes wound healing. Ignoring all other potential complications, the warmth, redness, and swelling described in the paragraph could be seen as the body's natural and healthy response to the knee injury. However, it is always recommended to clean and cover a wound like a cut to prevent any potential infection. So, based on the body's innate process to protect itself against harm, the blood flow to the area of Adam's inflamed injury will have increased."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Ashley Collman. PUBLISHED:. 09:48 EST, 4 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:54 EST, 4 November 2013. What started off as an innocent student tradition where upperclassmen men would present freshman women with a red rose and peck on the cheek at midnight has turned into something more debauched and, in some ways, dangerous. Full Moon on the Quad is a Stanford University tradition started in the late 1800s that went out of style for many years before being resurrected in the 1980s with the addition of binge drinking. On the first full moon on the school year, students get drunk and many dress up in costume or body paint to lock lips with as many people from midnight to 1am. This year it was held on October 22 instead of the full moon because of a conflict with homecoming. Welcome to college: On the first full moon of the school year, students at Stanford University participate in a 120-year-old tradition where freshman make out with upperclassmen on the quad. 'If you are single and want to make out with people, you just go up and kiss them,' senior Molly Vorwerck told ABC News. 'Usually they are people you know or know of - rarely a stranger. A lot of people are pretty tipsy and have a really good time.' Modern additions to this 'orgy of interclass kissing' (as it's been described in the New York Times) include a same-sex area and a bingo game where different kinds of students make up the different boxes: a pair of twins, a red head, someone who got a 2,400 on the SAT. The goal of the game is to get five in a row or all of the boxes for a blackout. The middle box is always the Stanford mascot - the Tree. This year's mascot, Calvin Studebaker, estimated that he kissed 566 people - a new record. 'Never kiss the Tree,' alumna Amanda Ach warned in the Times. 'He's like Patient Zero.' The number one issue for administrators is that the tradition occurs during flu season and that the mass exchange of saliva could spark an outbreak. Every year they attempt to educate the students on proper safety measures to ward off the cold or something worse like meningitis. 'We tell them, \\"Don't floss beforehand, don't brush, don't do anything that could create microabrasions in your gums for germs to get in.\\"' said Michelle Lee Mederos, an educator who graduated in 2011. 'And we have tables where we offer mints and little Dixie cups of mouthwash.' Modern spin: Full Moon on the Quad has become much more debauched since being revamped in the late 1980s. This year's event happened on October 22 due to a conflict with homecoming. Students kissed outside the school's old student union building, right. But for Dr William Schaffner, professor and chair of preventative medicine at Vanderbilt University, the real problem is not the spread of disease. 'The. emphasis on permission and mutual consent is absolutely critical. The. actual health hazard is probably very, very small and would be difficult. to measure,' Dr Schaffner said. 'Certainly if we have impaired males, who tend to get more aggressive, and females tend to get more submissive or accommodating, that's where the issues come up with the drinking and morning after regrets. ' The school has only cancelled the event once - in 2009 when many East Coast schools were dealing with an outbreak of swine flu. The tradition continued on an unofficial basis. Francisca Gilmore was a freshman that year and attended the event. She says she's gotten strep throat twice from participating. 'The repercussions were brutal, and I wish I had done better on the Econ 1A final I took later. But I think in the long run, getting to tell people I've kissed over 50-plus people in a night is worth it,' she said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is about a tradition at Stanford University called \\"Full Moon on the Quad.\\" It started a long time ago when older students would give red roses and little kisses to the new students. But now, it has changed a bit. Students at the university now have a big party with lots of kissing, and sometimes they drink alcohol too. They do this event on the first night with a full moon during the school year. Some people think that this tradition can be dangerous because it can cause sickness from all the kissing. The school tries to help keep students safe by giving them ways to stay clean, like mouthwash and mints. They also want to make sure that everyone at the event feels safe and that all the kissing is allowed only if both people want to. Dr. Schaffner, a professor from Vanderbilt University, thinks the danger from getting sick is small, but says the focus should be on making sure everyone is behaving safely and properly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: On 23 April 2014, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was reported to be considering a new rule that will permit ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier net neutrality position. A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband, according to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, permit fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving net neutrality. On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality. On 16 January 2015, Republicans presented legislation, in the form of a U.S. Congress H.R. discussion draft bill, that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers. On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying (\\"with some caveats\\") Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015. Adoption of this notion would reclassify internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and, according to Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, ensure net neutrality. The FCC is expected to enforce net neutrality in its vote, according to the New York Times.","output":"Title: \\"The Evolution of Net Neutrality: FCC Decisions, Municipal Broadband, and Legislative Actions\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the episode's premises, specifically regarding the character of Miranda and the concept of ugliness causing insanity. They also mention that the episode is slow, inconsistent, and too talky. The confusion about Kolos' ambassador role and the Federation's relationship with the Medusans further reveals their dissatisfaction. This indicates a negative sentiment towards the episode.  However, there are some slightly positive aspects in the review as well. The reviewer appreciates a specific part within the episode, where Kolos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience, which they seemed to enjoy. Also, they express their love for the show overall and admit that they will continue watching it, even if an episode may not be their favorite. Additionally, the reviewer implies that they might be willing to purchase the episode for a low price if it is available as a used copy. Overall, the sentiment in this review can be described as mixed with a leaning towards negative, as the negative points in the review outnumber the few positive aspects. The viewer's dissatisfaction with the episode's premises, inconsistency, pacing, and character roles overshadows their appreciation for a specific scene and the show's overall status."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

Q: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Article: From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \\"fit in\\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places.

Solve 222*o = 35634 - 45402 for o.. What is the answer??","output":"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old. 1. We have an equation: 222 times a letter \\"o\\" equals (35634 minus 45402). 2. First, let's find out what 35634 minus 45402 is. Since 45402 is a bigger number, we'll subtract 35634 from it:     45402 - 35634 = 9768. 3. Now, we have another equation: 222 times \\"o\\" equals 9768. 4. To find out what \\"o\\" is, we need to divide 9768 by 222. 5. So, 9768 divided by 222 equals 44. 6. Therefore, the value of \\"o\\" is 44.

Can you tell me the answer to when was the first refrigerator invented and by whom??","output":"The history of the refrigerator can be traced back to the invention of artificial refrigeration systems, which have significantly evolved over time. The first cooling devices were simple and less efficient, with improvements made as our understanding of refrigeration principles developed.  The invention of the refrigerator is attributed to several inventors over an extended period of time. However, the first functioning vapor-compression refrigeration system was developed by a British inventor, Dr. John Gorrie, in 1844. Dr. Gorrie was a physician primarily interested in cooling systems to help his patients suffering from yellow fever. He initially focused on developing an ice-making machine by using air-cycle refrigeration. In the following years, other inventors made crucial contributions to the development of the refrigerator. A major leap was taken by James Harrison, a Scottish-born Australian journalist and engineer. In 1851, Harrison opted for the vapor-compression refrigeration technique to create a functional ice-making machine. His invention worked using ether in a closed-cycle, as the refrigerant, and a compressor to move it. Within a few years, Harrison's machine received critical acclaim and multiple patents for his ice-making and commercial refrigeration technology. In 1876, the German engineer Carl von Linde took the technology further by being the first to substitute volatile liquid ether with safer, liquefied ammonia gas. Von Linde's system became the foundation of modern refrigeration technology. Ammonia-based refrigeration systems became popular in industrial and commercial establishments, further boosting the development of refrigerators. Eventually, the domestic refrigerator market began to grow, and manufacturers in the United States started producing household refrigerator systems. One of the earliest electric household refrigerators was produced by the General Electric company in 1911, which introduced the Kelvinator, featuring an automatic control system. Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd then patented the Einstein-Szilárd type of refrigerator design in 1930. This design employed no moving parts and was based on the absorption principle using only a heat source. The Freon era began in the 1930s as a result of a collaboration between the American engineer Thomas Midgley Jr., chemist Charles Kettering, and the Frigidaire company. Freon, a chlorofluorocarbon-based (CFC) refrigerant, served as a less toxic option than previous liquid refrigerants. The invention of Freon contributed significantly to the popularization of household refrigerators. In summary, the invention of the refrigerator is the result of several inventors, extensive research, and technological advancements over the years. However, it was Dr. John Gorrie who first invented an air-cycle refrigeration machine in 1844, with multiple inventors and engineers following this milestone to continuously improve the technology that shapes the modern refrigerator we know today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"Who was Demetrius child?\\"  Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

Here is a news article: Lack Of Deep Sleep May Set The Stage For Alzheimer's      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Oregon Health & Science University Courtesy of Oregon Health & Science University      There's growing evidence that a lack of sleep can leave the brain vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease.      \\"Changes in sleep habits may actually be setting the stage\\" for dementia, says Jeffrey Iliff, a brain scientist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.      The brain appears to clear out toxins linked to Alzheimer's during sleep, Iliff explains. And, at least among research animals that don't get enough solid shut-eye, those toxins can build up and damage the brain.      Iliff and other scientists at OHSU are about to launch a study of people that should clarify the link between sleep problems and Alzheimer's disease in humans.      It has been clear for decades that there is some sort of link. Sleep disorders are very common among people with Alzheimer's disease.      For a long time, researchers thought this was simply because the disease was \\"taking out the centers of the brain that are responsible for regulating sleep,\\" Iliff says. But two recent discoveries have suggested the relationship may be more complicated.      The first finding emerged in 2009, when researchers at Washington University in St. Louis showed that the sticky amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's develop more quickly in the brains of sleep-deprived mice.      Then, in 2013, Iliff was a member of a team that discovered how a lack of sleep could be speeding the development of those Alzheimer's plaques: A remarkable cleansing process takes place in the brain during deep sleep, at least in animals.      What happens, Iliff says, is \\"the fluid that's normally on the outside of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid — it's a clean, clear fluid — it actually begins to recirculate back into and through the brain along the outsides of blood vessels.\\"      This process, via what's known as the glymphatic system, allows the brain to clear out toxins, including the toxins that form Alzheimer's plaques, Iliff says.      \\"That suggests at least one possible way that disruption in sleep may predispose toward Alzheimer's disease,\\" he says.      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Oregon Health & Science University Courtesy of Oregon Health & Science University      To know for sure, though, researchers will have to study this cleansing process in people, which won't be easy.      Iliff studied the glymphatic system in living mice by looking through a window created in the skull. The system also involved a powerful laser and state-of-the-art microscope.      With people, \\"we have to find a way to see the same sort of function, but in a way that is going to be reasonably noninvasive and safe,\\" he says.      The solution may involve one of the world's most powerful magnetic resonance imaging machines, which sits in a basement at OHSU. The MRI unit is so sensitive, it should be able to detect changes that indicate precisely when the glymphatic system gets switched on in a person's brain, says Bill Rooney, who directs the university's Advanced Imaging Research Center.      When humans enter deep sleep, and toxin removal begins, there should be a particular change in the signal coming from certain salt molecules. That would indicate that fluid has begun moving freely through the brain.      In young, healthy brains, the signal should be \\"robust,\\" Rooney says, indicating that the toxin removal system is working well. In the brains of older people, and those who are likely to develop Alzheimer's, the signal should be weaker.      Rooney and Iliff have received funding from the Paul G. Allen Foundation to test their approach. They hope to begin scanning the brains of participants within a year.      One challenge, though, will be finding people able to fall asleep in the cramped and noisy tunnel of the magnetic resonance machine.      \\"It's a tricky thing because it's a small space,\\" Rooney says. \\"But we'll make people as comfortable as possible, and we'll just follow them as they go through these natural stages of sleep.\\"      If Rooney and Iliff are right, the experiment will greatly strengthen the argument that a lack of sleep can lead to Alzheimer's disease. It might also provide a way to identify people whose health is at risk because they aren't getting enough deep sleep, and it could pave the way to new treatments.      \\"It could be anything from having people exercise more regularly, or new drugs,\\" Rooney says. \\"A lot of the sleep aids don't particularly focus on driving people to deep sleep stages.\\" ||||| So the brain has this large pool of clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid. We call it the CSF. The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain, and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the CSF, which gets dumped, along with the waste, into the blood. So in that way, it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system, doesn't it? But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain, they don't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF. Instead, there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process. You can see that in these videos. Here, we're again imaging into the brain of living mice. The frame on your left shows what's happening at the brain's surface, and the frame on your right shows what's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself. We've labeled the blood vessels in red, and the CSF that's surrounding the brain will be in green. Now, what was surprising to us was that the fluid on the outside of the brain, it didn't stay on the outside. Instead, the CSF was pumped back into and through the brain along the outsides of the blood vessels, and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels, it was actually helping to clear away, to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain's cells. If you think about it, using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution, because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it's packed full of cells, so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system. Yet the blood vessels, they extend from the surface of the brain down to reach every single cell in the brain, which means that fluid that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume, so it's actually this really clever way to repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels, to take over and replace the function of a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels, to make it so you don't need them. And what's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells. This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain. ||||| Scientists Discover Previously Unknown Cleansing System in Brain      Newer Imaging Technique Brings ‘Glymphatic System’ to Light                  A previously unrecognized system that drains waste from the brain at a rapid clip has been discovered by neuroscientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The findings were published online August 15 in Science Translational Medicine .      The highly organized system acts like a series of pipes that piggyback on the brain’s blood vessels, sort of a shadow plumbing system that seems to serve much the same function in the brain as the lymph system does in the rest of the body – to drain away waste products.      “Waste clearance is of central importance to every organ, and there have been long-standing questions about how the brain gets rid of its waste,” said Maiken Nedergaard, M.D., D.M.Sc. , senior author of the paper and co-director of the University’s Center for Translational Neuromedicine . “This work shows that the brain is cleansing itself in a more organized way and on a much larger scale than has been realized previously.      An artery in the brain of a mouse. The green shows cerebrospinal fluid in a channel along the outside of the artery.      “We’re hopeful that these findings have implications for many conditions that involve the brain, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease,” she added.      Nedergaard’s team has dubbed the new system “the glymphatic system,” since it acts much like the lymphatic system but is managed by brain cells known as glial cells. The team made the findings in mice, whose brains are remarkably similar to the human brain.      Scientists have known that cerebrospinal fluid or CSF plays an important role cleansing brain tissue, carrying away waste products and carrying nutrients to brain tissue through a process known as diffusion. The newly discovered system circulates CSF to every corner of the brain much more efficiently, through what scientists call bulk flow or convection.      Maiken Nedergaard and Jeffrey Iliff      “It’s as if the brain has two garbage haulers – a slow one that we’ve known about, and a fast one that we’ve just met,” said Nedergaard. “Given the high rate of metabolism in the brain, and its exquisite sensitivity, it’s not surprising that its mechanisms to rid itself of waste are more specialized and extensive than previously realized.”      While the previously discovered system works more like a trickle, percolating CSF through brain tissue, the new system is under pressure, pushing large volumes of CSF through the brain each day to carry waste away more forcefully.      The glymphatic system is like a layer of piping that surrounds the brain’s existing blood vessels. The team found that glial cells called astrocytes use projections known as “end feet” to form a network of conduits around the outsides of arteries and veins inside the brain – similar to the way a canopy of tree branches along a well-wooded street might create a sort of channel above the roadway.      Those end feet are filled with structures known as water channels or aquaporins, which move CSF through the brain. The team found that CSF is pumped into the brain along the channels that surround arteries, then washes through brain tissue before collecting in channels around veins and draining from the brain.      How has this system eluded the notice of scientists up to now?      The scientists say the system operates only when it’s intact and operating in the living brain, making it very difficult to study for earlier scientists who could not directly visualize CSF flow in a live animal, and often had to study sections of brain tissue that had already died. To study the living, whole brain, the team used a technology known as two-photon microscopy, which allows scientists to look at the flow of blood, CSF and other substances in the brain of a living animal.      While a few scientists two or three decades ago hypothesized that CSF flow in the brain is more extensive than has been realized, they were unable to prove it because the technology to look at the system in a living animal did not exist at that time.      “It’s a hydraulic system,” said Nedergaard. “Once you open it, you break the connections, and it cannot be studied. We are lucky enough to have technology now that allows us to study the system intact, to see it in operation.”      First author Jeffrey Iliff, Ph.D. , a research assistant professor in the Nedergaard lab, took an in-depth look at amyloid beta, the protein that accumulates in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. He found that more than half the amyloid removed from the brain of a mouse under normal conditions is removed via the glymphatic system.      “Understanding how the brain copes with waste is critical. In every organ, waste clearance is as basic an issue as how nutrients are delivered. In the brain, it’s an especially interesting subject, because in essentially all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, protein waste accumulates and eventually suffocates and kills the neuronal network of the brain,” said Iliff.      “If the glymphatic system fails to cleanse the brain as it is meant to, either as a consequence of normal aging, or in response to brain injury, waste may begin to accumulate in the brain. This may be what is happening with amyloid deposits in Alzheimer’s disease,” said Iliff. “Perhaps increasing the activity of the glymphatic system might help prevent amyloid deposition from building up or could offer a new way to clean out buildups of the material in established Alzheimer’s disease,” he added.      In addition to Iliff and Nedergaard, other authors from Rochester include Minghuan Wang, Yonghong Liao, Benjamin Plogg, Weiguo Peng, Edward Vates, Rashid Deane, and Steven Goldman.

The \\"didn't help\\" part indicates that seeing her in a shiny new BMW SUV further contributed to the author's opinion that the woman might not have been genuinely trying her best during the class, as they potentially saw her as someone who is well-off and perhaps less likely to push herself or take the class seriously. The author's impressions are based on their own assumptions, interpretations, and personal beliefs that may or may not accurately represent the woman's actual effort and intentions during the class. However, by mentioning the BMW, the author draws attention to the fact that the woman's perceived wealth influenced their judgment of her commitment and sincerity in the class.

Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One's mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, who has feelings for him. While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen kick him repeatedly in the groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain's skills, the town's mayor hires him, and he randomly changes his name to Betty.

Write a question about the following article: The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States in the 20th century. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods. This engagement set the pattern for most Marine contacts with hostile forces in the Dominican Republic. Against Marine superiority in artillery, machine guns, small-unit maneuver, and individual training and marksmanship, no Dominican force could hold its ground.","output":"Given the historical context and military engagements described in the article, how did the strategic advantages of the United States, such as artillery, machine guns, small-unit maneuver, and individual training and marksmanship, contribute to the outcomes of the conflicts during the first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic from 1916 to 1924, specifically focusing on the tactics used in engagements like the one at Las Trencheras on June 27?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Scales Said to Tip in Favor of Antidepressant Use in Children Reuters reported that the F.D.A. had no plans to soften or eliminate antidepressants’ warning labels as a result of the new research. “At this time nothing indicates a need for change in the ‘black box’ warning, which urges attention to patients starting treatment,” said Dr. Thomas Laughren, director of the agency’s division of psychiatry products. The new analysis found that antidepressants worked best when used to treat anxiety. They worked moderately well in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders. They worked less well, though still effectively, in treating depression. Adolescents responded better than children to treatment for depression and anxiety, the researchers found. They also found that only Prozac worked better than dummy pills in depressed children younger than 12. In the studies involving depression, 61 percent of patients improved while on antidepressants. But 50 percent of depressed patients taking dummy pills also improved. Among young patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders, 52 percent improved on antidepressants, compared with 32 percent who improved on dummy pills. And in the studies of anxiety disorders, 69 percent improved on antidepressants and 39 percent improved on dummy pills. Dr. John March, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center, called the report “the most comprehensive analysis of the data yet put together.” But he said the suicidal behavior risk, although lower than found by the F.D.A., demanded that doctors and families watch for warning signs. “You can’t treat kids with these drugs without taking this information into account,” said Dr. March, who was not involved in the study but who does similar research. “You can’t say, ‘Take these and call me in six weeks.’ ” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Scales Said to Tip in Favor of Antidepressant Use in Children.

The study says that older kids feel better from these medicines than younger kids, and a drug called Prozac can help very young kids if they are sad.

Questions: If the temperature was really high, what is a likely reason for awaking in the middle of the night and being unable to fall back asleep? Options: - having to pee - discomfort - depression - irritability - shock A:","output":"The most likely reason for awaking in the middle of the night and being unable to fall back asleep when the temperature is really high would be discomfort. High temperatures can cause increased body temperature, more sweating, and an overall feeling of stuffiness. This can create an uncomfortable environment for sleep, which may lead to restlessness and waking up.  When the body is warm and the temperature is high, it is more difficult for the body to cool down, leading to discomfort. This is because the body needs to maintain a certain core temperature during sleep, which can be disrupted by high ambient temperatures. Staying cool is essential for proper sleep, as it allows for better melatonin production, which is a hormone that regulates sleep. Although the other options provided – having to pee, depression, irritability, and shock – can potentially cause someone to wake up in the middle of the night and have difficulty falling back asleep, they are not as directly influenced by high temperatures. Having to pee, for example, is a normal bodily function and may occur with or without high temperatures. Depression and irritability can be related to sleep disturbances, but they are more likely to be caused by underlying mental health issues rather than a specific environmental condition. Shock, on the other hand, involves a significant stressor, and while that could potentially be worsened by high temperatures, it is not the most common reason for waking up and being unable to fall back asleep in a hot environment. In conclusion, discomfort is the most likely reason for awaking in the middle of the night and being unable to fall back asleep when the temperature is really high. It is important to ensure proper sleep conditions – including maintaining a cool and comfortable environment – to promote quality and restful sleep."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Felicia 's hair is shinier.;","output":"Lindsey regularly incorporates coconut oil into her daily routine, while Felicia prefers not to use it. Now, let's compare their hair conditions. To make a fair comparison, it is important to consider each individual's hair type, hair care routine, and the products they use. Nevertheless, we can discuss the potential impact of coconut oil on the appearance of their hair. Coconut oil is known to have properties that can nourish the hair, lock in moisture, and create a natural shine. As a result, Lindsey's dedication to using coconut oil is likely to give her hair a glossy sheen. On the other hand, Felicia chooses not to utilize coconut oil, and might be using other products to maintain her hair's health and shine. Taking this information into account: 1) Lindsey's hair is shinier because she is using coconut oil regularly, promoting hair moisture and nourishment that leads to a glossy appearance. However, it's important to remember that individual hair types and overall hair care routine play a significant role in the appearance of one's hair. Just because Lindsey uses coconut oil and her hair appears shinier, it does not necessarily mean that Felicia's hair is unhealthy or lacks shine.

The first two species (coast redwood and giant sequoia) are native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon. Alpinia: Alpinia is a genus in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, consisting of around 230 species. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, from India to Japan and southeast to Australia and the Pacific Islands. Step 3: Analyze the information and construct an answer From my research, it is evident that the Genii Sequoia (coast redwood and giant sequoia) are native to America, specifically the western United States. On the other hand, the Alpinia plants are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, indicating they are not native to America. Step 4: Formulate the final answer Yes, the Genii Sequoia, comprising of coast redwood and giant sequoia, is native to America, specifically the western United States, while the Alpinia plants are not native to America, as they originate from tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who succeeded in 1873 with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine? from the following article ?  Massenet returned to Paris in 1866. He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, La grand'tante,  presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé's reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy  Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon. His reputation as a composer was growing, but at this stage he earned most of his income from teaching, giving lessons for six hours a day.

Edna Medford, a professor of history at Howard University in Washington, D.C., was an adviser on this study and the earlier one.She says Abraham Lincoln is seen to represent the values the nation most honors, such as truthfulness, moderation, and respect for human rights. The historians put American's first president, George Washington, second on the list, while Franklin D.Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, and Harry Truman follow in that order.John   F.Kennedy, the country's first Roman Catholic president, is sixth on the list.Like Lincoln, Kennedy was murdered while in office.

Please answer a question about the following article about Qing dynasty: The early Manchu rulers also established two foundations of legitimacy which help to explain the stability of their dynasty. The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture which they adopted from earlier dynasties. Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar-official elites gradually came to terms with each other. The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials. Imperial patronage of Kangxi Dictionary demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values. The second major source of stability was the Central Asian aspect of their Manchu identity which allowed them to appeal to Mongol, Tibetan and Uighur constituents. The Qing used the title of Emperor (Huangdi) in Chinese while among Mongols the Qing monarch was referred to as Bogda khan (wise Khan), and referred to as Gong Ma in Tibet. Qianlong propagated the image of himself as Buddhist sage rulers, patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. In the Manchu language, the Qing monarch was alternately referred to as either Huwangdi (Emperor) or Khan with no special distinction between the two usages. The Kangxi Emperor also welcomed to his court Jesuit missionaries, who had first come to China under the Ming. Missionaries including Tomás Pereira, Martino Martini, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, Ferdinand Verbiest and Antoine Thomas held significant positions as military weapons experts, mathematicians, cartographers, astronomers and advisers to the emperor. The relationship of trust was however lost in the later Chinese Rites controversy. Who did the Manchu appeal to?","output":"The Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty appealed to a diverse group of ethnic constituents, including the Han Chinese, Mongols, Tibetans, and Uighurs. They accomplished this by establishing foundations of legitimacy that catered to the unique cultural and traditional aspects of each ethnic group. For the Han Chinese scholar-official elites, the Manchu rulers adopted bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture from earlier dynasties. They maintained the examination system, which allowed ethnic Han individuals to become officials. Additionally, the imperial patronage of the Kangxi Dictionary and the Sacred Edict of 1670 demonstrated respect for Confucian learning and family values. The Manchu rulers also cultivated their Central Asian heritage to appeal to Mongols, Tibetans, and Uighurs. They used different titles such as \\"Huangdi\\" (Emperor) in Chinese, \\"Bogda Khan\\" (wise Khan) among the Mongols, and \\"Gong Ma\\" in Tibet. Qianlong, one of the most famous Qing emperors, even propagated the image of himself as a Buddhist sage ruler and a patron of Tibetan Buddhism.

Options: [I] No [II] Yes The answer is:","output":"[I] No A reasonable and detailed answer would be: The normal International Normalized Ratio (INR) range is typically between 0.8 and 1.2 for a healthy individual not on blood-thinning medications. INR is a standardized measurement used to assess blood clotting levels in patients. The test is important for monitoring the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin treatment, because it helps physicians to adjust the dosage and maintain the desired therapeutic range. For patients on anticoagulant therapy, the target INR range is typically between 2.0 and 3.0, although it may vary depending on the specific condition being treated. The term \\"ProTime INR\\" and \\"PT/INR\\" are used interchangeably with INR, as they all refer to the same test. Prothrombin Time (PT) is the actual time it takes for blood to clot, which is measured in seconds. The INR standardizes this value to account for variability in laboratory testing methods and reagents used, so that results can be accurately compared across different labs and healthcare providers. In other words, the test measures the Prothrombin Time (PT) and converts it to the International Normalized Ratio (INR).

Maybe it's the first time you've colored yours, or perhaps you've been doing it for so long you hardly remember what your natural color looks like, but either way, the game has changed. New hydrating formulas (made with oils and butters and no ammonia) are replacing the older, harsher ones, and innovations such as foam make it even easier to handle coloring at home. Because there are so many great options out there, we asked experts to explain how to get your best shade ever (whether you want your actual color, only better, or to try a whole new hue) and how to protect it. We have you covered—from root to tip! Be prepared The healthier your hair is to start, the better it will take (and retain) a new hue, says Rick Wellman, color director at Patrick Melville Salon in New York City. You'll also get longer-lasting shine. Dry, damaged hair can soak up dye, leaving a blotchy result. A week before coloring, prep strands with a clarifying shampoo. This helps remove oils and product buildup that could interfere with the dye, explains Ben Stewart, color director at Cutler Salon in New York City.

Take baby steps If your hair's cocoa-colored, it's going to take a lot to get to Heidi Klum blond—and, chances are, your hair will suffer major damage along the way. It's best to make small adjustments from your starting point (natural or dyed) so you—and your hair—have a chance to adapt. Also, an at-home attempt isn't the time to be daring: \\"A skillful colorist can make a radical change, but it's probably best left to professionals,\\" Stewart says. Note: If you've dyed your hair dark, it's hard to lighten it back, he says. You'd first have to bleach hair to remove all pigment, then apply new color. Resist! Find your best shade When you're buying a box of color at the drugstore, you want to select a hue that works with your general coloring, says Brad Johns, color director of the Salon and Spa at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City. Whatever you pick, first test a small section at the base of your neck. Eyeball it: To determine whether you need a warm or cool tone (either more golden or more ashy), check your eyes. If there are flecks of brown-orange in your irises, go warm. If the flecks are green or blue, pick a cool shade. Check your jewelry: If you look better in silver than in gold, choose cool tones. If you gravitate toward gold, warmer is likely best. Follow an old photo: Check out those family albums. \\"Hair gets darker as you age,\\" notes Johns. \\"The color that you had when you were a child is brighter than what you have now but still within the same color family, so it will look the most natural.\\" Health.com: How to fix the 9 worst signs of aging Know your type Next, decode the boxes on store shelves. Semi or demi. A semipermanent color lasts three to four shampoos, while demi sticks around for about 28. Both are good options if you're new to color, but only demi will hide grays. It fades gradually within four to six weeks, so if you don't like the color, it's not a big commitment, and you can touch it up yourself. Neither lightens hair. Permanent. This is great choice if you are going several shades darker or lighter and want lasting color (roots will need retouching every six to eight weeks).

In the early stages of the First Punic War (264 BC) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held, described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat. The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods. The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term, and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice. What was not the ultimate purpose of gladiatorial rites? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The ultimate purpose of gladiatorial rites was not to have the gladiators die or be sacrificed every time they fought.

In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States.

It translates to \\"Hand soaps (e.g., hard, liquid, soft)\\" in English. In this context, the phrase is discussing different types of hand soaps and their physical forms, such as hard (solid), liquid, and soft (mousse-like or foamy). Each type of soap has its distinct characteristics and usage scenarios. 1. Hard soap (Savon dur): This type of soap typically comes in a solid bar form and has been used for centuries for personal hygiene and cleaning routines. Hard soap is made by mixing fats or oils and an alkali, typically sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. It has a longer shelf life compared to its liquid counterparts and tends to produce less waste, as it comes in minimal or recyclable packaging. Additionally, bar soaps are usually more cost-effective than liquid soaps because they last longer and don't require as frequent replacements. However, some people might find it inconvenient for shared spaces, such as public restrooms, due to hygienic concerns. 2. Liquid soap (Savon liquid): Liquid soap is a popular choice for handwashing since it's easy to use and dispense through soap dispensers, making it a more hygienic option in shared spaces. It is produced by using potassium hydroxide as the alkali, which results in a liquid consistency. Liquid soap often contains added moisturizers and fragrances, catering to a variety of preferences. While liquid soap tends to be more expensive than bar soap due to its packaging and production process, it is perceived as a more luxurious and modern option by some users. 3. Soft soap (Savon mou): Soft soaps include foaming hand soaps and mousse-like soaps. Foaming soaps typically contain a cartridge filled with diluted liquid soap and a foaming pump that mixes air with the soap to create a light, fluffy foam. These types of soaps feel gentle on the skin and tend to use less soap per wash, which may result in cost savings over time. Mousse-like soaps have a similar texture to whipped cream, providing a rich, luxurious lather. Both types of soft soaps often come in appealing scents and packaging, adding an element of enjoyment to the handwashing experience. In conclusion, the French phrase \\"Savons à main (p.ex., dur, liquid, mou)\\" provides an insight into the diverse world of hand soaps available in various forms, such as hard, liquid, and soft. Each type of soap offers its unique benefits and experiences, catering to the needs and preferences of different users."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given an utterance, which is a part of a conversation between a user and an agent.

The increase comes as no surprise, as Florida’s Magic Kingdom, along with every other major theme park, generally raises its admission price each year. “There is strong demand for our attractions and entertainment,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. “We continually add new offerings and experiences, and many of our guests select multiday tickets or annual passes, which provide a great value and additional savings.” Still, there’s no doubting just how expensive Magic Kingdom’s ticket prices have become.

His father was a doctor. So he was often with the doctors and got along very well with them. When he was fourteen, he was already hanging around the hospital where he was supposed to be helping to clean the medicine bottles, but was actually trying to listen to the doctors' conversations with patients in the next room. During the war Sanders served in the army as a surgeon . \\"That was the happiest time of my life. I was dealing with real sufferers and on the whole making a success of my job.\\" In Rhodes he taught the country people simple facts about medicine. He saw himself as a life-saver. He had proved his skill to himself and had a firm belief that he could serve those who lived simply, and were dependent upon him. Thus, while in a position to tell them what to do he could feel he was serving them. After the war, he married and set up a practice deep in the countryside, working under an old doctor who hated the sight of blood. This gave the younger man plenty of opportunities to go on working as a life-saver. Answer:","output":"Question: What influenced Sanders's decision to become a doctor instead of a sailor, and how did he develop his skills eventually? A) He was inspired by his father, who was a doctor, and gained experience by hanging around hospitals and serving as a surgeon in the army.

The Blues were last beaten in the Champions League by Atletico Madrid back on 30 April. Werder Bremen defeated the Londoners in a pre-season match in August, but we're not counting friendlies. So that's 218 days since a competitive defeat. This got Newsbeat thinking about what else could be achieved in the time since Chelsea lostâ€¦ Around 700 candidates, narrowed down from 200,000, are hoping to be among the first human voyagers to Mars. Whoever gets the call-up can look forward to a journey time of around 200 days to get to the red planet, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit. It took YouTube user John Colandra seven months to put together a two-hour film out of footage from almost every stop on Kanye West's Yeezus concert tour. What would you choose: winning loads of football matches or watching stacks of Kanye clips? Why win endless football matches when you could grow a nice apple?

It takes around 15 months to prepare a Championships' standard court before it can be played on. Got that Jose? Play on. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube","output":"The article compares the last unbeaten run of the Chelsea Football Club to a series of unrelated events spanning a similar time frame. Chelsea's last defeat in the Champions League was against Atletico Madrid on 30 April, a stretch of 218 days without a competitive defeat. The article then humorously juxtaposes this achievement to various scenarios, casting light on what else could be achieved during such a period. The first comparison made is to the preparation process for a manned space mission to Mars. Considering the travel time to Mars, which is about 200 days, a mission could be nearly concluded within the time frame of Chelsea's unbeaten run. A total of around 700 candidates, whittled down from an initial pool of 200,000, hope to be the first humans to embark on this journey. Next, the article compares Chelsea's winning streak to the time-consuming project of a YouTube user named John Colandra. It took him about seven months to compile a two-hour film using footage from almost all stops on Kanye West's Yeezus concert tour. The article also brings in an agricultural comparison, stating that an apple takes between 100 to 200 days to fully mature which could coincide with Chelsea's unbeaten period. This brings up an amusing choice, suggesting that one could either follow Chelsea's relentless victories or indulge in growing an apple tree. On a more serious term, the time span since Chelsea's last defeat could have been enough to resolve the tensions between Iran and the rest of the world over the country's nuclear activities. According to US Secretary of State John Kerry, a period of seven months would be sufficient to broker a deal. Finally, the article takes a shot at Chelsea's manager, Jose Mourinho, noting that in order to match the diligent dedication of Wimbledon's caretakers, Chelsea's unbeaten streak would need to be doubled. This is because approximately 15 months of advance preparation is required to get the tennis courts at Wimbledon to championship standards. Overall, the article playfully puts Chelsea's impressive unbeaten record in perspective by comparing it to various events, both monumental and mundane, suggesting a wide array of activities that could be accomplished within the same timeframe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded?  Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. a network of scientists who visualize how a disease might spread. \\"It's useful to predict where an outbreak is going,\\" says Irene Eckstrand, the former scientific director of MIDAS. Under Eckstrand's leadership, the modelers in her program predicted scenarios for various big outbreaks, including H1N1 and currently Ebola. Information about the biology of the virus, the mode of transmission, and the geographical spread can be used to predict who will be affected next and how fast they'll be reached. The various scenarios modeled are then used to inform policy decisions such as travel restrictions and school closures by determining their impact. It's also crucial to envision the distribution of vaccines, to ensure the most vulnerable are reached first. In the case of Ebola, models helped determine the number of hospital beds required in high-risk areas. The likelihood of disease models accurately reflecting reality are regularly called into question but Eckstrand states they are crucial when working with the unknown. \\"Infectious disease models are never going to accurately predict the future,\\" she says. \\"[They] are better at saying 'if we do this, here's the range of things that can happen.'\\" When a virus is well understood, such models can be generated quickly. \\"Models can integrate complexities in a way our brains can't,\\" says Eckstrand. However, the spread of a disease is about more than its biology. Human behavior plays a key role and is much harder to predict, as was the case for Ebola, where burial traditions and cultural practices aided transmission when the outbreak emerged. The lack of trust between those affected in West Africa and their health authorities also prevented people from seeking diagnosis and treatment. \\"[There's been a] great deal more collaboration in Ebola,\\" says Eckstrand speaking of weekly phone calls between those working on control, including scientists, researchers, homeland security and national laboratories. \\"The world is unprepared,\\" stated WHO director general Margaret Chan at a session alongside Peter Piot in Davos. \\"After H1N1, the conclusion was the world is ill prepared for severe and sustained disease.\\" In her eyes, the scale of Ebola last year was unprecedented. New ideas are needed to prevent this happening again in the future. \\"We need to think outside the box in the future,\\" says Barclay, whose team works on the development of vaccines to stop the H1N1 pandemic in its tracks. But she doesn't think disease-specific vaccines are the way forward for all outbreaks. \\"For Ebola, Chikungunya, Lassa fever, Marburg ... are we really going to invent one for each one?\\" Barclay instead thinks one way forward could be therapeutics that tackle the symptoms of disease, meaning where diseases have similar symptoms -- such as Ebola and Marburg virus disease -- there could be a drug against the symptoms of all of them to reduce further spread of infections. But when it comes to influenza, where the greatest global risk lies, the experts seem more optimistic. \\"If we had another flu pandemic we would be fairly well set to run models quickly,\\" says Eckstrand. Given the likelihood of another pandemic, Barclay's team see it fit in this case to develop disease-specific antivirals and vaccines against influenza when it arrives. In 2009, the development of an H1N1 vaccine slowed down the spread of the virus during the second wave of its transmission. The time taken for development meant it wasn't available during the first big wave of infections. At the core of it all, the global monitoring systems in place are constantly being tuned to spot any strange, or new, occurrences. \\"I look at GOARN as a safety net,\\" concludes Heymann. GOARN is growing its capability to both spot and control disease outbreaks, with a network of labs, provision of advice and assistance when a new outbreak occurs. It is also building capacity within countries through improved labs, technology and skilled staff, to enable systems to be in place worldwide to tackle new or emerging infections spreading throughout a population. \\"Countries that have had Ebola are more ready to deal with it, like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),\\" says Heymann of the country where the disease was first identified in 1976. Congolese communities now have a word for the disease and messages are in place to send out when a new outbreak occurs. With MERS now climbing to the top as the infection on people's minds, its worth knowing that whilst we may not be quite ready to prevent disease outbreaks, we are, at least, more ready than ever before. Epidemics throughout history. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Modeling Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) is a network of engineers and scientists who employ state-of-the-art modeling techniques to conceptualize how a disease may spread. By using factors like the biology of the virus, the mode of transmission, and the geographical spread, MIDAS can predict the possible trajectory of an outbreak. The former scientific director of MIDAS, Irene Eckstrand, led the program to create predictive models for various significant outbreaks, including H1N1 and Ebola. These disease models guide policy decisions regarding travel restrictions, school closures, and vaccine distribution. For instance, in the case of the Ebola epidemic, they were instrumental in gauging the number of hospital beds required in areas of risk. While the accuracy of these models may sometimes be debated, Eckstrand believes they are vital, particularly when dealing with unknown variables. She asserts that models can integrate complexities in ways the human brain cannot and are capable of presenting a range of possible outcomes. Not only do these models look at the transmission of the disease from a biological standpoint, but they also take into account human behavior, which can often be challenging to predict. This unpredictability was evident during the Ebola outbreak when cultural practices and a distrust in health authorities affected the spread and control of the disease. Looking ahead, experts assert more innovative thinking is necessary to prevent future outbreaks. Some suggest rather than creating disease-specific vaccines for every new outbreak, it may be more advantageous to develop therapeutics that tackle the common symptoms of diseases. Nevertheless, when it comes to influenza, where the global risk is high, disease-specific antivirals and vaccines remain a priority. The effectiveness of disease modeling was exhibited in 2009 when the H1N1 vaccine developed helped slow the virus spread during its second wave of transmission. However, due to the vaccine development time, it wasn't available during the first wave of infections. Global monitoring systems like the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) contribute immensely to disease control. It bolsters disease outbreak spotting and control capabilities, offering advice, and assistance during a new outbreak. It also helps build capacity within countries through improved labs, technology, and skilled staff, thus equipping them with effective systems to tackle new or emerging infections. According to Professor David Heymann, the Democratic Republic of Congo is one country that has learned and adapted through past experiences. As such, it is better equipped to handle diseases like Ebola.  In summary, while predicting and preventing disease outbreaks remain a challenge, endeavors like MIDAS and GOARN and innovative thinking in finding universal therapeutics are making us more prepared than ever before."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even after  Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted.

These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film begins deep in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania during the Cold War, where a group of Russian and British explorers are searching for a long-lost 13th-century Eastern Orthodox abbey. As they venture inside and below the church, they make a startling discovery: the abbey is built over the entrance to a vast subterranean cave system. When they try to blast their way in, they cause a landslide that buries the abbey and the men are trapped in the cave below it. Once they recover, they continue on into the cave without a choice in hopes of finding a way out, but as they do, they hear strange sounds coming from the darkness. Thirty years later, a team of archeologists are excavating the ruins of the same abbey, where they unearth images of a medieval battle between the Knights Templar and winged demons, and discover the cave system with its massive underground river. The team is led by Dr. Nicolai (Marcel IureÅ) and his associate Katheryn Jannings (Lena Headey), along with her cameraman Alex Kim (Daniel Dae Kim). Local biologists believe the cave could contain an undiscovered ecosystem, so they hire a group of American spelunkers led by Jack McAllister (Cole Hauser) and his brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian) to help them investigate its unknown depths. Jack and Tyler are thrill-seeking professional cave explorers who run a world-famous team of divers. They arrive in Romania with the latest equipment, including a modified rebreather system allowing a diver to remain submerged for up to 24 hours. The diving team includes rock-climbing professional Charlie (Piper Perabo), first scout Briggs (Rick Ravanello), sonar expert Strode (Kieran Darcy-Smith) and survival expert Top Buchanan (Morris Chestnut).

Write an article with the title: \\"Berries may delay memory decline\\"","output":"Title: Berries May Delay Memory Decline Human memory is an essential component of our lives, affecting our capabilities of learning, communication, and decision-making processes. However, as we age, our cognitive abilities, including memory, also wane. Notably, recent scientific research suggests that certain foods like berries may go a long way in delaying memory decline associated with aging.  A prime concern of health experts and scientists worldwide is the progressive decline in cognitive health tied to the aging process. Memory loss often indicates the onset of age-related disorders like dementia and Alzheimer's disease, imposing significant health and economic burdens on societies globally. Hence, strategies to delay or slow this decline can improve quality of life for the elderly while reducing healthcare costs. Berries, a diverse group of fruits that include strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries, among others, are loaded with vitamins, minerals, dietary fibers, and phytochemicals. Scientifically, berries are considered rich sources of bioactive compounds like flavonoids, anthocyanins, and antioxidants, known to protect cell structures and improve bodily functions. Among the numerous beneficial compounds present in berries, the flavonoids have gained remarkable attention for their potential role in enhancing memory performance. These compounds are known to cross the blood-brain barrier easily, indicating their potential in influencing various neurological processes. Flavonoids have been found to give berries their vivid hues, but more than that, they have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. They can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—a significant cause of neurodegenerative diseases leading to memory decline. Flavonoids interact with the signaling pathways associated with memory and learning in the brain, therefore improving overall cognitive abilities. Studies have revealed that anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid found abundantly in berries, can accumulate in the brain regions involved in learning and memory, thus backing the concept that berries could improve memory performance. For example, a study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that elderly people who consumed blueberries and strawberries had slower rates of cognitive decline than those who did not.  Another study from the Tufts University and University of Maryland showed that feeding aging rats diets supplemented with blueberries reversed some loss of balance and coordination and improved short-term memory. Notably, these rats performed better on memory tests than the control group. It's also essential to highlight that berries are a good source of vitamins like vitamin C and vitamin K, which are known for their potential role in promoting brain health. Vitamin C has been associated with managing stress levels, while vitamin K has been linked with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.  In addition, the high fiber content in berries may improve gut health, which can positively impact brain health. The connection between gut and brain health, also known as the gut-brain axis, is an increasing area of focus in health research. A healthy gut can influence brain function, and ultimately, memory. In conclusion, while more research is needed, the current findings underline the potential role of berries in slowing memory decline. Regular consumption of these natural jewels can be an effective preventive measure toward age-related memory decline and related conditions. However, it's also essential to remember that a balanced and varied diet accompanied by regular physical exercise is the cornerstone of maintaining overall brain health. Incorporating berries into your diet is not only an avenue towards boosting your memory health but also a colorful, sweet, and savory journey to a healthier lifestyle. So, the next time you make a grocery list, remember to reserve a special place for berries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Goal: What should I do with my windows during the summer? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"During the summer season, managing your windows effectively is essential to maintain a comfortable and energy-efficient home. There are several methods you can apply to achieve this goal. I will provide you with a detailed comparison of some common methods and suggest the most reasonable ones to adopt. 1. Opening windows for ventilation: Opening your windows during summer helps to allow fresh air into your home, improving indoor air quality, and providing natural ventilation. However, it is crucial to choose the right time to open your windows. In the mornings and evenings, when the outside temperature is cooler, opening windows can provide a refreshing breeze. Conversely, during the hottest parts of the day, it's better to keep windows shut to prevent warm air from entering your home. This way, you can maintain a more comfortable temperature indoors without overburdening your air conditioner. 2. Utilizing window coverings: Using window coverings, such as curtains, blinds, and shades, is an effective way to block sunlight and heat from entering your home. You can opt for light-colored or reflective window coverings that can help reduce heat gain by reflecting sunlight. In particular, cellular shades, solar shades, and blackout curtains offer significant insulation and light-blocking properties. 3. Installing window films: Solar window films are another excellent method to reduce heat gain in summer. These films are applied directly to the window glass, providing a barrier that blocks heat and sunlight while still allowing for visibility. They come in various tints and can reduce the amount of heat entering your home by up to 80%. Additionally, window films can help prevent UV rays from fading your furniture, carpets, and other interior elements. 4. Sealing gaps around windows: Ensuring that your windows are properly sealed prevents drafts and helps maintain a consistent indoor temperature. During the summer, make sure to check for gaps and seal them, as needed, with weatherstripping or caulking. This will prevent hot outside air from leaking into your home and putting additional strain on your air conditioning system. 5. Planting shade trees and installing awnings: Another effective method to cool your home during the summer is by planting shade trees or installing awnings outside your windows. Shade trees not only help to cool the air surrounding your home, but they also provide a pleasant view from your windows. Awnings, on the other hand, provide direct shading for windows, blocking sunlight and heat from entering. Considering all these methods, the most reasonable approach for managing your windows during the summer would be a combination of opening windows for ventilation during cooler times of the day, using appropriate window coverings, and sealing any gaps around windows. These steps not only ensure a comfortable indoor environment but also reduce the workload on your air conditioning system, resulting in energy savings. Additionally, if you're willing to invest in long-term solutions, installing solar window films, planting shade trees, and adding awnings can provide significant benefits in maintaining a cooler home and lowering energy costs over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.  and a hint : The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  Please answer this question : Which company had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, company X or company Y? Answer:","output":"Company Y had fewer costs than benefits related to debt. As per the given situation, Company X stopped taking on more debt and decided to file for bankruptcy, which indicates that the costs of financial distress, including bankruptcy costs, outweighed the tax benefits of debt for Company X. In contrast, Company Y continued benefiting from the tax advantages of debt while maintaining a lower debt level. This suggests that Company Y was effectively managing its debt and balancing the trade-off between tax benefits and costs associated with financial distress, resulting in a more favorable debt situation than Company X."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Definition: In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \\"|||||\\". Your task is to summarize them. Input: Crops are wilting, schools have shut their bathrooms and government officials are bathing in lagoons because of a severe shortage of fresh water in a swath of the South Pacific.      The island groups of Tuvalu and Tokelau have declared emergencies, relying on bottled water and seeking more desalination machines. Parts of Samoa are starting to ration water.      Supplies are precariously low after a severe lack of rain in a region where underground reserves have been fouled by saltwater from rising seas that scientists have linked to climate change.      While nobody has gone thirsty yet, officials worry about the logistics of supplying everyone with enough water to survive and the potential health problems that might arise. And exactly how the islands will cope in the long term remains a question mark.      \\"We are praying that things will change,\\" Samoan-based official Jovilisi Suveinakama said.      Six months of low rainfall have dried out the islands. Climate scientists say it's part of a cyclical Pacific weather pattern known as La Nina _ and they predict the coming months will bring no relief, with the pattern expected to continue.      Rising sea levels are exacerbating the problem, as salt water seeps into underground supplies of fresh water that are drawn to the surface through wells.      On the three main atolls that make up isolated Tokelau, the 1,400 residents ran out of fresh water altogether last week and are relying on a seven-day supply of bottled water that was sent Saturday from Samoa, Suveinakama said.      Suveinakama said that some schools no longer have drinking water available, and that the students often need to return home if they want to use a bathroom.      \\"In terms of domestic chores, like washing clothes, everything's been put on hold,\\" he said. \\"We are cautious of the situation given the possible health issues.\\"      Suveinakama said that Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand, has tapped emergency funds to buy desalination machines, which turn salt water into fresh water. He hopes those will be shipped to the islands soon.      In Tuvalu, a nation of low lying atolls that is home to less than 11,000 people, Red Cross team leader Dean Manderson described the situation as \\"quite dire.\\"      He said that on the island of Nukulaelae, there were only 16 gallons of fresh water remaining Tuesday for the 350 residents and that the Red Cross was sending over two small desalination machines.      He said much of the well water on Tuvalu is unusable because it has become contaminated with salt water.      The New Zealand government this week flew a defense force C-130 plane to Tuvalu stocked with Red Cross supplies of bottled water and desalination machines. Officials including High Commissioner Gareth Smith also flew over to assess the situation.      Smith said the coconut trees on Tuvalu are looking sickly and that the edible breadfruit, which grow in trees, are much smaller than usual. He said other local fruits and vegetables, including a type of giant taro, are not growing well or are in short supply.      He said people in the capital of Funafuti are permitted a ration of two buckets of water per day and that government ministers have been bathing in the lagoon to preserve water.      Funafuti residents have been relying on a large desalination machine for much of their daily water supply, said Manderson. The Red Cross has been helping improve the function of that machine and has been fixing other such machines that have broken down, he added.      New Zealand climate scientist James Renwick said the rainfall problems can be traced back 12 months, when the region began experiencing one of the strongest La Nina systems on record.      La Nina is sparked when larger-than-normal differences in water temperature across the Pacific Ocean cause the east-blowing trade winds to increase in strength, Renwick said. That, in turn, pushes rainfall to the west, leaving places like Tuvalu and Tokelau dry.      Last year's La Nina system dwindled by June but has begun picking up again just ahead of the November rainy season, Renwick said, meaning that there is no relief in sight for island groups like Tuvalu, Tokelau and Samoa.      \\"Low rainfall continues to be on the cards, at least through the end of the year,\\" Renwick said.      Officials say they are concentrating on the short-term supply problems and have not yet had time to think about longer term solutions for the islands. But they say that the combination of rising water levels and low rainfall mean makes life on the islands look increasingly precarious. ||||| Image caption Water supplies will have to be brought to Tokelau by barge from ships anchored offshore      A second South Pacific community is suffering a severe water shortage due to an ongoing drought crisis.      Tokelau declared a state of emergency late on Monday, following a similar move in neighbouring Tuvalu, where water is already being rationed.      A New Zealand-administered territory of three islands, Tokelau's 1,400 people have less than a week's drinking water left.      The lack of rainfall is blamed on the La Nina weather pattern.      Officials said Tokelau had run out of natural fresh water and was relying solely on bottled water.      New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said other islands in the South Pacific were also reporting water shortages.      Parts of Samoa have begun rationing water.      He said New Zealand was rushing to assess the situation throughout the region, amid fears the crisis could escalate.      This is having a severe impact on crops, so there's likely to be a food shortage as well Murray McCully, NZ Foreign Minister      New Zealand was \\"making sure we deal with the drinking water issue most urgently\\", he said.      A New Zealand Air Force plane landed in Tuvalu on Monday carrying containers of water and desalination units.      Tuvalu, one of the world's smallest independent nations, with a population of about 11,000, lies about halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Tokelau is about 500km (310 miles) to the east.      Impact on crops      Mr McCully said the situation was urgent in parts of Tuvalu.      He said there was less than a week's supply of drinking water on Funafuti, the main island of Tuvalu.      \\"I understand one of the other outlying islands, Nukulaelae, has a more urgent shortage and there is a desalination plant on the way there,\\" Mr McCully said.      \\"There are going to be some flow-on effects here, clearly this is having a severe impact on crops, so there's likely to be a food shortage as well.\\"      La Nina causes extreme weather, including both drought and floods, and was blamed for floods in Australia, South East Asia and South America in late 2010 and early 2011.      David Hebblethwaite, a water conservation expert with the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, said Tuvalu had experienced low rainfall for the past three years and there had been no precipitation at all for seven months.      He said Funafuti and Nukulaelae both lacked groundwater supplies, making them dependent on rainfall collected from the roofs of homes and government buildings.      Mr Hebblethwaite said the islands may also need extra medical supplies if water shortages lead to sanitation issues and consequent health problems. ||||| Output:","output":"The South Pacific island groups of Tuvalu and Tokelau declare emergencies due to severe water shortages. A lack of rainfall, linked to the La Nina weather pattern, has critically impacted water supplies in the region. Rising sea levels have also contaminated underground fresh water reserves with saltwater. Efforts are being made to provide bottled water and desalination machines to the affected areas. Crops are suffering damage, leading to potential food shortages, and schools have been forced to close bathrooms. The long-term solution remains uncertain, with the ongoing weather pattern expected to provide no relief in the coming months. A second South Pacific community, Tokelau, faces a severe water shortage and has declared a state of emergency. Neighboring Tuvalu is already rationing water due to ongoing droughts.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 0 = -13*d - 0*d - 18*d for d.","output":"To solve the equation 0 = -13*d - 0*d - 18*d for the variable d, we will first simplify the equation and then isolate d. Step 1: Simplify the equation 0 = -13*d - 0*d - 18*d As we know, multiplying any number by 0 results in 0. Therefore, the term 0*d equals 0, and we can eliminate it from the equation, leaving: 0 = -13*d - 18*d Now, we can combine the like terms. The like terms in this equation are the terms with the variable d (-13*d and -18*d). So, adding the coefficients together, we get: 0 = (-13 - 18)*d 0 = -31*d Step 2: Isolate the variable d Now, we need to isolate d to find its value. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -31. 0 = -31*d 0 / -31 = (-31*d) / -31 Since 0 divided by any nonzero number is still 0, we get: 0 = d So, the value of d which satisfies this equation is 0.  In conclusion, to solve the equation 0 = -13*d - 0*d - 18*d for d, we first simplified the equation by eliminating the 0*d term and combining like terms. Afterward, we isolated d by dividing both sides of the resulting equation (0 = -31*d) by -31 to find that d = 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Female Pakistani Fighter Pilot Tragically Dies in Aircraft Crash in Punjab Province A young and talented female Pakistani fighter pilot lost her life in a tragic aircraft accident in the Punjab province, a stark reminder of the inherent risks faced by these brave individuals at the forefront of national defense. The incident further emphasizes the need for continued investment in the training and safety of these pilots, as well as the crucial role they play in maintaining the security of Pakistan's airspace. The unnamed female pilot was flying a routine training mission when her aircraft, according to preliminary reports, experienced technical difficulties which ultimately led to the unfortunate crash in the Punjab province, a region vital to the nation's economy and defense. The loss of the pilot adds another name to the relatively short list of female fighter pilots in Pakistan, a profession that is continuously evolving to break gender barriers and promote inclusivity in an often male-dominated occupation. This serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by these women who endeavor to excel in such an arduous line of duty. As discussions surrounding the crash ensue, the importance of continued investment in the training and safety of Pakistan's pilots is underscored. As a key element in safeguarding and protecting the country's airspace, their proficiency in flying these highly sophisticated and technologically advanced aircraft remains paramount. It is essential to recognize the efforts and sacrifices made by these pilots, as the nature of their duties often involves placing themselves in harm's way to ensure the sovereignty and security of the nation. In light of this incident, the assessment and improvement of safety measures for both the pilots and the aircraft they fly become all the more significant. Moreover, the incident reflects on the current state of Pakistan's aviation industry and raises vital questions regarding maintenance and modernization of its air force fleet. As with any case of a military aircraft crash, it serves as a point of introspection for the armed forces to review and potentially update their existing protocols to reduce the likelihood of similar occurrences in the future. Additionally, this tragedy sheds light on the determination and resilience of Pakistani female pilots who continue to make strides in a field that is gradually becoming more gender-inclusive. Their representation in such crucial roles advances the cause of gender equality and paves the way for future generations of ambitious and talented women from the country to pursue their dreams, regardless of the obstacles they face. The armed forces of Pakistan, along with the nation as a whole, come together in mourning the unfortunate death of the female fighter pilot. Her dedication, enthusiasm, and skills in her profession stand testament to her bravery and resilience. While her loss is profoundly felt by her comrades and loved ones, her achievements will not be forgotten, and her legacy will continue to resonate through the ranks of the Pakistan Air Force. In conclusion, the tragic crash which claimed the life of a female Pakistani fighter pilot highlights the risks these individuals face daily in their pursuit of protecting the nation's sovereignty. It reinforces the need for continued investment in their training, safety, and overall well-being, as well as the importance of maintaining and modernizing Pakistan's air fleet. The pilot's tenacity and commitment to breaking gender barriers in her profession will remain an inspiration for generations to come, championing a progressive and inclusive armed forces culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\".

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: What is likely the job of the people who conducted the study at Deakin University? Options: - They are most likely researchers at the university. - not enough information - They are probably the owners of a facility that makes macaroni and cheese. - They are most likely world famous chefs.

Input: Paragraph: Surveillance European bat lyssavirus Rabies Zoonoses Conservation A B S T R A C T Worldwide, there are more than 1100 species of the Order Chiroptera, 45 of which are present in Europe, and 16 in the UK. Bats are reservoirs of, or can be infected by, several viral diseases, including rabies virus strains (in the Lyssavirus genus). Within this genus are bat variants that have been recorded in Europe; European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) and, four currently unclassified isolates. Since 1977, 783 cases of EBLVs (by isolation of viral RNA) have been recorded in Europe. EBLV-1 or EBLV-2 has been identified in 12 bat species, with over 95% of EBLV-1 infections identified in Eptesicus serotinus. EBLV-2 is associated with Myotis species (Myotis daubentonii and Myotis dasycneme). A programme of passive surveillance in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 2004 tested 4871 bats for lyssaviruses. Of these, four M. daubentonii (3.57% of submitted M. daubentonii) were positive for EBLV-2. Potential bias in the passive surveillance includes possible overrepresentation of synanthropic species and regional biases caused by varying bat submission numbers from different parts of the UK. In 2003, active surveillance in the UK began, and has detected an antibody prevalence level of 1-5% of EBLV-2 in M. daubentonii (n = 350), and one bat with antibodies to EBLV-1 in E. serotinus (n = 52). No cases of live lyssavirus infection or lyssavirus viral RNA have been detected through active surveillance. Further research and monitoring regarding prevalence, transmission, pathogenesis and immunity is required to ensure that integrated bat conservation continues throughout Europe, whilst enabling informed policy decision regarding both human and wildlife health issues.   Title: European bat lyssaviruses: Distribution, prevalence and implications for conservation Output:","output":"True I used the definition, which asks to determine if the given title is suitable for the research paper based on the given paragraph. The paragraph discusses the presence of European bat lyssaviruses (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2), their distribution, prevalence in specific bat species, and various surveillance efforts conducted in the United Kingdom to detect and monitor the viruses. The paragraph then concludes by stating the importance of further research and monitoring for the conservation of bats in Europe and addressing human and wildlife health issues.

In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\".

Allen Welsh Dulles (; April 7, 1893 - January 29, 1969) was an American diplomat and lawyer who became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and its longest-serving director to date. As head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War, he oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat, Operation Ajax (the overthrow of Iran's elected government), the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission. Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. DCI Smith recruited Dulles to oversee the agency's covert operations as Deputy Director for Plans, a position he held from January 4, 1951. On August 23, 1951, Dulles was promoted to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, second in the intelligence hierarchy. After the election of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Bedell Smith shifted to the Department of State and Dulles became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence.  The Agency's covert operations were an important part of the Eisenhower administration's new Cold War national security policy known as the \\"New Look\\".  At Dulles' request, President Eisenhower demanded that Senator Joseph McCarthy discontinue issuing subpoenas against the CIA. In March 1950, McCarthy had initiated a series of investigations into potential communist subversion of the Agency. Although none of the investigations revealed any wrongdoing, the hearings were potentially damaging, not only to the CIA's reputation but also to the security of sensitive information. Documents made public in 2004 revealed that the CIA, under Dulles' orders, had broken into McCarthy's Senate office and fed disinformation to him in order to discredit him, in order to stop his investigation of communist infiltration of the CIA.  In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force conducted a competition for a new photo reconnaissance aircraft. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's Skunk Works submitted a design number called the CL-282, which married sailplane-like wings to the body of a supersonic interceptor. This aircraft was rejected by the Air Force, but several of the civilians on the review board took notice, and Edwin Land presented a proposal for the aircraft to Dulles. The aircraft became what is known as the U-2 'spy plane', and it was initially operated by CIA pilots. Its introduction into operational service in 1957 greatly enhanced the CIA's ability to monitor Soviet activity through overhead photo surveillance. The aircraft eventually entered service with the Air Force. The Soviet Union shot down and captured a U-2 in 1960 during Dulles' term as CIA chief.  Dulles is considered one of the essential creators of the modern United States intelligence system and was an indispensable guide to clandestine operations during the Cold War. He established intelligence networks worldwide to check and counter Soviet and eastern European communist advances as well as international communist movements. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What other achievements did he have?","output":"Other achievements Allen Dulles had include: \\"As head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War, he oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat, Operation Ajax (the overthrow of Iran's elected government), the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: If I want to maximize my number of potential customers, where should I build a new department store?  Choices:  - idaho - shopping mall - big city - in town - new york  The rationale to choose \\"big city\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Big city offers the largest population, which leads to a higher number of potential customers for a new department store. Major cities have higher foot traffic, more public exposure, and typically higher spending power than other options like small towns or shopping malls. Additionally, cities tend to have better infrastructure, which makes them more accessible for customers. In contrast, Idaho and New York are specific locations that may not have the same potential customer reach as a generic big city, while shopping malls may have limited space and face competition from other stores. Therefore, the best choice for maximizing the number of potential customers is to build the new department store in a big city."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Lucas has an epiphany, and in an attempt to save the store, takes the day's cash receipts to Atlantic City. While initially very lucky, he loses the entire amount. The next morning, Mark (Ethan Embry) and AJ (Johnny Whitworth) find Lucas asleep behind the store, still perched on his motorcycle, and quickly deduce that Lucas has made a grievous mistake while entrusted with the store money. Lucas adopts a bizarre, almost zen-like attitude towards his actions. AJ and Mark feign ignorance as to the missing money when Joe discovers the night deposit was never made, and the money is missing.Joe is distracted from dealing with this immediate crisis due to a scheduled publicity stunt.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who writes a note containing frequent usage of the word \\"cunt\\"? from the following article ?  In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \\"sex maniac\\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie apologises for the obscene letter, but Cecilia surprises him and confesses her secret love for him. They then proceed to make passionate love in the library when Briony walks in, and thinks that Cecilia is under attack. Cecilia and Robbie try to pass the incident off.","output":"In the given passage, the person who writes the note containing frequent usage of the word \\"cunt\\" is Robbie Turner.

Social media help us be parents, study finds Social media offer more than a way to brag about those pancakes eaten at breakfast or that toddler swinging at the playground. The online networks are also a key pipeline for social support and finding tips about parenting, according to a by the Pew Research Center. Three of four parents with children under age 18 use social media to interact with other parents, most often by responding to good news, the study found. Cultivating online friendships builds a support network that can be tapped when things aren’t so happy, giving frustrated parents a place to turn for creative tips on such dilemmas as how to get their kid to eat his peas. The research also found that half of mothers who are online — moms use social media more frequently than dads — have received emotional support from their online networks about parenting problems. Those who answer a friend’s question are more likely to receive support when they reach out, highlighting the importance of giving back within social circles. The Pew report was based on surveys written by the University of Michigan and conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates. It surveyed 2,003 adults 18 and older. Facebook was the most-used social media service in the survey, with tech-savvy parents also using Pinterest and LinkedIn, 28 percent and 27 percent of the time, respectively. That makes sense, considering that Pinterest and LinkedIn have information-sharing capabilities, while Instagram, which is used more often by nonparents, is strictly based on sharing photos. The average parent has fewer Facebook friends, about 150 compared to the average nonparent’s 200 friends, Pew found. But that smaller network means it can take less time to find useful information. Despite red flags that are raised about posting too much online, only 12 percent of the parents in the study said they have felt uncomfortable when information is shared about their child on social media. They did, however, worry about the actions of their offspring: 33 percent expressed concern regarding their child’s technology use in the past year. Pew also found that attempts to evade parents online aren’t working out very well, with 65 percent of parents 40 and older reporting that they are Facebook friends with their children.

The town is a sleepy border town and the cops are mostly bored, occasionally dealing with minor offenses. The Sheriff, Morey Johnson (Walter Matthau), has to compel them to pay attention to their duties at times. During the course of the story, the seemingly unrelated progress of a tractor-trailer truck carrying toilets, driven by Carroll O'Connor, is inter-cut with the principal events. Joining Bondi in jail, Burns tries to persuade him to escape. He tells Bondi he couldn't spend a year locked up because he'd probably kill someone. Burns defends Bondi from the attention of sadistic Deputy Sheriff Gutierrez (George Kennedy), who picks Burns as his next target. During the night the inmates saw through one of the jail's bars using two hacksaw blades Burns hid in his boot. The deputy summons Burns in the middle of the night and beats...

Background Paragraph: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Story: Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A major indicator of the victim mentality is the tendency to place blame on outside sources for the state you are in. Maybe you blame your spouse because you stopped going out with friends and ended up feeling socially isolated. Maybe you blame your parents for not exposing you to certain opportunities in life that would ensure your future success. No matter where blame is directed, it’s essentially useless. When you blame others, you give them power over your life instead of taking your destiny into your own hands. What’s more, you also push people away in the process. Do you spend most days of the week lamenting to any who will listen about your problems or inadequacies? Do you notice friends slowly not taking your phone calls or people avoiding you at work? Even the best relationships have trouble surviving when one person always has something bad to share. Complaining can be a tempting behavior and nonstop venting may seem to make you feel good on the surface. However, constant complaining sends the message to your brain to look for the negative, which only makes you feel worse in the long run. Feeling inadequate and not good enough is at the core of the victim mentality. A self-loather often views him/herself negatively and is always nervously waiting for others to spot all their inadequacies.  This kind of person is terribly hard to be in a relationship with because they cannot accept praise or compliments. Someone else may say “Wow, you did a great job on this project!” and the person pushes away the compliment with “Oh, no it was Tommy who did all the work.” One way to stop self-loathing is to accept the reality that how you see yourself isn’t the only or right way for you to be. Recognize that others' perceptions of you may be different, but, at least to them, they may also be accurate. Another clear sign of being a victim is living in the past. You may constantly reflect back on your earlier years and regret decisions or actions that you didn’t take.  Dwelling in the past is pointless since you can never go back there. Do you find yourself falling into the shoulda, woulda, coulda trap? If so, you must recognize that you are wasting time today focusing on what’s already done. Instead turn to the present and see what you steps you can take to improve from here. If you find yourself always examining the lives of friends, family, or other acquaintances and thinking about how great they have it, you are keeping yourself stuck in misery and failure. Theodore Roosevelt argued that “comparison is the thief of joy” because it’s virtually impossible to be content with your own life when you are always busy measuring yourself up to others.  In some instances, comparisons can spark competition to improve yourself. For example, you notice that a coworker is well on his way to earning a promotion, you may then be inspired to work equally as hard.  Yet, if it is not used wisely and carefully, it can backfire and leave you miserable. Keep a careful watch on your comparing nature, and remind yourself that even people that seem to have it all together also deal with trials and tribulations just like you. Having an internal locus of control means that you feel like you can influence the outcome of your own situation. However, having an external locus of control means that you feel like you cannot influence the outcome of your situation because the situation controls you. This is a sign of victim mentality.  For example, if your boss is unsatisfied with your performance and gives you a negative review, then you might think to yourself, \\"He is impossible to please. Guess I am going to get fired.\\" This would indicate an external locus of control and a victim mentality. On the other hand, someone who has an internal locus of control might respond to a negative performance review more proactively, such as by thinking, \\"Okay, that sucked, but what can I do to improve my performance, ensure that my boss is happy, and secure my job?\\" Work on developing your sense of control over your life circumstances and events to overcome this aspect of victim mentality. In general, taking on a victim mentality is unhealthy for you personally and socially. However, there are some situations when feeling like a victim is warranted, particularly in situations when you have been harmed physically or emotionally.  For instance, almost anyone is bound to feel sorry for themselves after being betrayed or cheated on by a lover. Or, after having a serious car accident that results in you having to use a wheelchair. In spite of these circumstances, it's still important for you not to wallow in self-pity or ruminate about how bad your situation is. Taking the positive route is an overall healthier and more adaptive approach and can improve your self-esteem in the long run.

North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The result of President Eisenhower's threat toward China was that an armistice was quickly reached, leading to the end of active fighting in the Korean War.

Article:","output":"Title: Bulger Family Condemns Hotel Protesters During Charity Dinner Introduction: The family of James Bulger, the toddler tragically killed in 1993, have expressed their condemnation of protesters who disrupted a charity event held in the youngster's memory. Background: The murder of two-year-old James Bulger in 1993 shocked the nation and left lasting scars on the family and community. In an effort to honor his memory, James' family has worked tirelessly to create events and initiatives that positively impact their local community. Charity Dinner: A recent charity dinner was held at a hotel, bringing together friends, family, and supporters of the Bulger family to raise much-needed funds for their ongoing efforts. This event, organized by the family and community, was meant to celebrate the life and legacy of James Bulger, fostering unity and offering support to those still grieving his loss. Protesters Disrupt Event: However, a group of protesters broke into the hotel during the charity dinner, causing alarm among the guests and disrupting the carefully planned event. The motives behind the protesters' actions are currently unclear, but the Bulger family have expressed their outrage and disappointment over the incident. Family Response: James Bulger's family have since condemned the actions of these protesters, stating that their intrusion was disrespectful to the memory of the young boy. They maintain that such acts only serve to undermine the goodwill and unity of those present at the charity event, many of whom were there to contribute to the cause and remember James' life. Community Repercussions: The community has largely echoed the sentiments of the Bulger family, emphasizing the importance of respecting the memory of James and the efforts surrounding the various charity events and initiatives held in his name. The actions of the protesters have raised concerns over the future of these events, leaving the Bulger family and the community in fear of further disruptions. Conclusion: In the aftermath of the interrupted charity dinner, both the family of James Bulger and the community at large have expressed their sorrow at the disrespectful actions of the protesters. Moving forward, the family hopes to channel their anger and frustration into further pursuing their goal of building a lasting legacy for James by helping others in their community. They urge those who truly care about honoring James' memory to continue supporting their efforts and unite in the face of setbacks like this protest."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select activities that require you to be focused, but not to the point that you lose awareness of your hair playing behavior. Activities such as reading, playing a video game, watching a movie, and writing may be activities that increase the likelihood of your hair playing. Playing a game outdoors or taking your dog for a walk can be great distractions.  Some activities, thoughts and feelings may increase your urge to play with your hair. If you catch yourself immediately say, “Stop,\\" then find a substitute activity. For example, if you are talking to someone and you start to play with your hair, grab a pen to hold, or even sit on your hands.  Observe the number of times you need to distract yourself from playing with your hair. This will help you understand the severity of your habit. You will likely notice a high frequency in the beginning stages; but that leaves a lot of room for celebrating your improvements. There are a lot of possibilities such as baking a cake, playing a sport, making something from metal or wood, frosting some cookies, shopping for clothing, building a rock garden, painting with both hands (give it a try), doing handstands, grooming your pet, or playing a musical instrument, etc.  Not only will you stop playing with your hair, but you could have a lot of fun too. Find new and exciting things to do that you’ve never done before. Be adventurous. You may discover a new and rewarding interest. Worry stones may help you dispel the nervous energy that is causing you to play with your hair. These are smooth stones that are made for you to play with and rub. They have also been successfully used to help smokers deal with fidgeting as they quit smoking. You can find them online or in some health or new age stores. Playing with your hair can be a sign that you feel anxious or bored, which means it's important to deal with the cause rather than take it out on your hair. If you're feeling anxious, there are many calming techniques you could try. Talking to someone who will lend an ear, will help you process your feelings. If you are bored, then find a way to entertain yourself.  Try meditation or yoga, which will help you focus on your breath and will teach you to be calm.  Find other soothing behaviors that will help you manage your anxiety. Simply talking to yourself (out loud or silently) in a positive way will help. Tell yourself, “I’m safe and I am taking care of myself and everything is going to be okay, and I don’t need to play with my hair.”  A sure cure for boredom is to get busy doing the things you need to do. Make a list and check off each item as you complete it. Summary:","output":"Sometimes, people play with their hair when they feel bored or anxious. To stop this habit, it's important to find other things to do that keep our hands busy and our minds focused. We can do activities like reading, playing outside, or making something with our hands. If we still feel the urge to play with our hair, we can hold a pen or a smooth stone called a worry stone to help us feel calm. Talking to someone about our feelings or trying calming activities like yoga can help too.

Ideally, you want a bowl large enough to dip all of your nails at once.  Pick a bowl that can stand up to freezing or chilling. Metal bowls will hold in the cold and be cold to the touch. Plastic will insulate the water but may be easier to handle. Consider dedicating a bowl just for beauty regiments. You probably do not want to accidentally get nail polish on your favorite mixing bowl. After you’ve picked the right vessel, fill it with cold water. You want the coldest water possible without freezing everything in the bowl. This will help the ice not to melt so quickly. You want to add a cup of ice (cubes, not crushed) to the bowl. This will create cold enough water to help instantly dry your nails. Once you’ve added the ice, return the bowl to the fridge if you intend to paint your nails right away. If you think you it will take at least an hour for your manicure, consider returning the bowl to the freezer so the ice does not melt. Be warned, wait too long and the entire bowl will freeze. Once the bowl is chilling, now it is time to put on your favorite manicure. You can use whatever type polish you would like. Paint your nails as you normally would. Remove the bowl from the fridge or freezer, carefully. Be careful not to smudge your wet nails doing this! If you can, have someone assist you with this. Place the bowl on a flat surface. If you are putting the bowl on wood, place a towel or trivet underneath the bowl. This will prevent water rings on the surface. You can place both hands at once, being careful that your fingers do not touch each other. Or, you can place one hand at a time. You will want to submerge your hands slowly as not to cause the water to ripple and damage your nails. This is going to be cold. It might be a little bit painful. But, the longer your nails are submerged, the drier your nails will become.  Once your hands have been successfully submerged, remove them from the water and place them on a towel. You can test the dryness of the nail polish by lightly touching your nail. It should be hard to the touch. As odd as it sounds, after removing your hands from the water, your nails should appear dry. Cold water can damage your hands, so pat down your hands to dry them. Consider applying your favorite lotion to your skin, after your nails are successfully dry of course, to stop skin damage. Summary:","output":"To make your nails dry quickly, find a big, strong bowl and fill it with cold water and some ice cubes. Put it in the fridge or freezer, but not for too long or it will freeze. Paint your nails with your favorite color. Take the bowl out, put it on a flat surface with a towel under it, and carefully dip your fingers in the water.

The first sentence states that the forces of Sher Shah Suri defeated Mughal Emperor Humayun's army, while the second sentence suggests that it was Humayun's forces that defeated the army of Sher Shah Suri. Therefore, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other. To provide some more context, the Battle of Chausa took place on June 26, 1539, near the banks of the Ganges River in Chausa, which is present-day Bihar, India. It was a significant battle during the Mughal-Suri conflict, which occurred between the Mughal Empire, led by Emperor Humayun, and the Suri Empire, led by Sher Shah Suri. To clarify, the first sentence is historically accurate: the forces of Sher Shah Suri defeated Mughal Emperor Humayun's army in the Battle of Chausa. The victory of Sher Shah Suri at Chausa significantly impacted the power dynamics in India, leading to the brief establishment of the Suri Empire, which controlled the Indian subcontinent for a short period before the Mughals regained power. The Battle of Chausa marked a turning point in the Mughal-Suri conflict, forcing Humayun into exile and paving the way for Sher Shah Suri's rise to power."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eminem is known for his complex lyrics, storytelling, and fast rapping, while Honey Singh is famous for his Punjabi rap and party songs. Step 2: Analyze their impact on the industry Eminem is one of the best-selling artists worldwide and has influenced many rappers, while Honey Singh has made a significant impact in his regional industry, especially in India and has popularized Punjabi rap music. Step 3: Assess their awards and accomplishments Eminem has won multiple awards, including 15 Grammys. In contrast, Honey Singh has achieved several awards within the Indian music industry.

What is the process of distillation? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They are both asking about the process involved in distillation. Here is a detailed and long answer for the process behind distillation: Distillation is a widely-used separation technique in both the chemical and industrial sectors. It serves to isolate individual components from a mixture, usually of liquids, based on their differing boiling points. The process benefits numerous industries, including petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and beverage production. The underlying principle behind distillation revolves around the equilibrium that exists between a liquid and its vapor. When a mixture is heated, each component's vapor pressure increases. When the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure, the liquid begins to boil. In a mixture with various substances, components with lower boiling points vaporize first. By carefully controlling the temperature, we can separate liquids based on their boiling points. Here is a step-by-step rundown of the distillation process: 1. Heating the mixture: The process begins by heating the liquid mixture in a container called a still (for simple distillations) or in the reboiler of a distillation column (for fractional distillations). The heat source can be direct (like a Bunsen burner) or indirect (using a heating mantle, oil bath, or steam). 2. Vaporization: As the mixture's temperature increases, its constituents start to vaporize. Components with lower boiling points vaporize first. The vapor comprises a higher concentration of these lower-boiling-point components than the liquid mixture does. In fractional distillation, the vapor will often pass through a series of trays or packing materials within the distillation column to increase the effectiveness and separation efficiency. 3. Condensation: The vapor then rises and enters the condenser. Here, the vapor encounters a cooler surface or a cooling agent. This cooling allows the vapor to condense back into a liquid state. In a simple distillation, the vapor is condensed directly, whereas, in fractional distillation, the vapor travels up the distillation column and is condensed after making contact with cooler sections or trays. 4. Collection: The condensed liquid, also known as the distillate or product, then accumulates in a separate collection vessel. In simple distillation, this occurs once, while fractional distillation may involve several collection points to obtain different fractions at varying boiling points. Often, a fractionating column is used to segregate diverse fractions more efficiently in lieu of conducting multiple simple distillations. 5. Repeating the process: For certain mixtures, a single pass through the distillation process may not achieve the desired level of separation or purity. If necessary, this will require the distillate to undergo multiple rounds of distillation, often called multi-stage or continuous distillation. This technique is especially beneficial in large-scale or industrial applications. It is important to note that distillation has its limitations. Some mixtures with very similar boiling points, like azeotropes, may be difficult or impossible to separate using conventional distillation methods. In such cases, alternative techniques such as extractive distillation, pressure swing distillation, or the use of entrainers may be employed. In conclusion, distillation is a crucial separation process in numerous industries and relies on the differing boiling points of components in a mixture. The heated mixture transforms into vapor before condensing back into a liquid and being collected as separate factions or purified products. Repeating the process may be necessary to attain the desired level of separation."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Help as much as you can. Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: American English is full of colorful expressions. One such expression is to touch all bases. There are four bases in baseball - first, second, third and home plate. When a baseball player hits the ball, he must run to each base - in order - and touch it with his foot. It is the only way to get a point. If the player hits the ball and fails to touch all the bases, the point will not be counted. The importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. Hank Aaron was a player with the Atlanta Braves team. He was trying to find the record for hitting the most home runs  . Aaron needed just one home run to be well matched with the record held by Babe Ruth, the greatest hitter in baseball history. Aaron got that home run the very first time he had a chance to hit the ball. That gave him 714 home runs - the same as Babe Ruth. After that day, baseball fans held their breath every time when it was Hank Aaron's turn to hit. When would he hit home run number 715? The wait was not long. In the second week of the season, Aaron again hit the ball over the wall. He had beaten Babe Ruth's record. But first, he had to run around the four bases. The other players on his team watched carefully to make sure he touched each one. So, to touch all bases means to do what is necessary to complete an activity. The expression is used to business and politics. No business deal or political events are really complete until you discuss all the problems involved. Or, as it is said, until you touch all bases. Question: When was the importance of touching all the bases shown? - At the start of the 1974 baseball seasons. - At the end of the 1974 baseball seasons. - Before the baseball rules made. - In the second week of 1974.

Question: What were the group of natives preparing to sacrifice? Movie title: King Kong Movie plot: In the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, Fred Wilson, a spokesman and promotions specialist for a huge oil conglomerate, Petrox, is preparing a voyage aboard one of the corporation's exploration ships. As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jeff also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be \\"wed\\" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jeff is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the first names of the people who take Blake downtown?, using the article: Dr. Donald Blake, a science professor at Dunsford University, receives delivery of a coelacanth. A student, Jimmy, asks Blake if the fish is really a million years old. Blake replies, \\"It's the species that's old. No change in millions of years. See, the coelacanth is a living fossil, immune to the forces of evolution\\". Blake lectures his students about evolution and devolution, telling them that man is the only creature that can decide whether to move forwards or backwards, and that \\"unless we learn to control the instincts we've inherited from our ape-like ancestors, the race is doomed\\". Inside the lab, Blake scratches himself on its teeth of the Partially-thawed coelacanth, accidentally sticking his bloody hand into the water-filled container which held the fish. Molly Riordan, assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver, is with Blake and offers him a ride home. When they get to Molly's car, Blake says he doesn't feel well and passes out. At Blake's home, Molly is attacked by person or persons unknown. Madeline Howard, Blake's fiancee and daughter of Dr. Gilbert Howard, president of the university, arrives and finds the home in shambles and Blake moaning on the ground. Madeline calls the police after seeing Molly hanging by her hair in a tree, her eyes wide, dead. Detective Lt. Mike Stevens and Detective Sgt.

The review leverages strong language to express dissatisfaction with the experience at the shop. The reviewer found the staff, referred to as \\"cutters,\\" to be tediously slow and nonchalant, which frustrated them and caused considerable waits.  There is a marked dissatisfaction with two main points of the customer journey: firstly, the cutting table where products get prepared and, secondly, the checkout line where payment gets processed. The reviewer uses descriptive metaphors like \\"slow as molasses,\\" \\"interminable wait,\\" and \\"move like thickened molasses\\" to highlight the slowness and inefficiency they witnessed. These metaphors display a potent discontent and express the frustration the reviewer feels.  The reviewer also uses direct questions like \\"Can they move any slower???\\" This rhetorical device is another indicator of their frustration and implies their desire for more efficiency.  They end their review with \\"UGH!,\\" which is an international sound of disgust or irritation. This again amplifies the negative sentiment and underscores their dissatisfaction.  The review is summed up with the phrases \\"very, very terrible and sluggish\\" and \\"spend a lot of time waiting in long, slowly-moving lines,\\" both indicating a strong negative sentiment. The fact that these were the reviewer's final thoughts underlines their overall negative experience and dissatisfaction with the service they received.  Thus, based on the consistent use of negatively connoted words, expressions of frustration and dissatisfaction, and the concluding negative summary, this review can be described definitively as having a negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: Make frozen banana pops How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish making frozen banana pops, I would follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather materials and ingredients - Bananas - Popsicle sticks or wooden skewers - Chocolate chips or chocolate bar (optional) - Toppings (such as crushed nuts, granola, shredded coconut, etc.) - Microwave-safe bowl or double boiler (to melt chocolate, if using) - Baking sheet or plate - Parchment paper or wax paper - Freezer-safe container or plastic wrap for storage Justification: Having all necessary items ready at the beginning of the process ensures a smooth workflow and prevents interruptions. Step 2: Prepare the bananas - Peel the bananas and cut them in half. - Insert a popsicle stick or wooden skewer into the cut end of each banana half. Justification: Cutting the bananas in half and inserting a stick makes them easier to handle while applying toppings. Step 3: Optional - Melt the chocolate - If using chocolate, melt it using either a microwave-safe bowl or a double boiler. Make sure to stir the chocolate occasionally to ensure even melting and to avoid burning. Justification: Some people prefer frozen banana pops with a chocolate coating, and melted chocolate will easily coat the banana and adhere to the toppings. Step 4: Prepare the toppings - Place desired toppings in shallow dishes or plates, ready for dipping or rolling the bananas in. Justification: Having the toppings ready in shallow dishes makes it easier to apply them to the bananas. Step 5: Apply toppings - Dip or roll the bananas in the melted chocolate, if using, and immediately follow with dipping or rolling in the prepared toppings. Alternatively, simply dip or roll the plain bananas in the toppings if not using chocolate. Justification: Applying toppings or coatings in this order helps them adhere better to the bananas. Step 6: Freeze the banana pops - Place prepared banana pops on a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper or wax paper, making sure they do not touch each other. - Freeze for at least 2-3 hours or until solid. Justification: Freezing the banana pops separately on a lined sheet ensures they do not stick together or to the surface, and it allows enough time for them to become fully frozen before consumption. Step 7: Storage - Once the banana pops are frozen, you can transfer them to a freezer-safe container or wrap individually in plastic wrap to protect from freezer burn. Justification: Proper storage prevents the frozen banana pops from absorbing any unwanted flavors or odors in the freezer and helps them maintain their quality and texture.

Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. The answer to this question is:","output":"Karen, who has sickle-cell anemia, has a hemoglobin that gives rise to the crescent-shaped cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sue Fleming's suitcase opens by accident, dropping her clothes from a double-decker bus onto Norman Winthrop. She retrieves her belongings and enters the New York City bus terminal. Intrigued, he follows her and returns a garter belt she overlooked. Steve Borden, the man she is involved with, calls her on the phone (though he is also in the terminal) and tells her to buy a ticket to San Francisco. Afterward, she sees him with another woman. They board the bus too. Norman, who is supposed to go to San Francisco by train, decides to travel by bus instead. Murphy has orders from Norman's father to keep him away from women. To Murphy's satisfaction, Sue rebuffs Norman's initial attempts to become better acquainted. May gives all her money to a friend, but manages to charm the bus driver, various relief drivers and Willy, a talkative, know-it-all passenger, into letting her ride for free. When the bus stops in Poughkeepsie, Steve and Nita Borden prove to be con artists, selling bibles at inflated prices to those who have lost loved ones recently, claiming they were specially ordered by the deceased. Nita, suspecting what is going on, later chats with Sue and introduces her husband, Steve. A disgusted Sue breaks up with Steve. She then makes a date with the persistent Norman at Niagara Falls. While Norman is getting ready, Murphy steals his clothes, but Norman goes with Sue to see the Falls wearing a raincoat provided by the tour company. When a tour employee demands the raincoat, Norman is shown to have only a bath towel on underneath. Norman arranges a candle-lit dinner for two in Chicago, but Murphy invites all the other passengers.

Dan and Jim were interested and read more on the subject. Dan read more about predatory protozoa, while Jim read more about herbivore protozoa.  Which student read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms?  Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make chocolate peanut brittle  Put the sugar, water and glucose in a saucepan.  Place on the heat.  Stir till the sugar is dissolved.","output":"Once the sugar is completely dissolved, insert a candy thermometer into the saucepan, ensuring that the tip does not touch the bottom of the pan. Continue cooking the sugar mixture over medium heat without stirring, but feel free to gently brush down the sides of the pan using a wet pastry brush in order to prevent sugar crystals from forming. Keep heating the mixture until it reaches the hard crack stage, which is around 300°F (150°C) on your candy thermometer. This process may take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, so be patient and keep a close eye on the thermometer to avoid burning the sugar. While the sugar mixture is cooking, in a separate microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips using a microwave or a double boiler. Stir the chocolate occasionally until it's smooth and glossy. Set aside to slightly cool, but make sure it remains spreadable. Next, prepare the peanuts by rough-chopping half of them and leaving the remaining peanuts whole. This will create a nice variety of textures in your peanut brittle. Combine the chopped and whole peanuts in a bowl and set them aside. Once the sugar mixture has reached the hard crack stage, remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully stir in the butter, which will be melted, and the baking soda. The mixture will bubble and foam, producing a lighter texture, so be cautious during this step. After mixing in the butter and baking soda, carefully fold in the peanuts, making sure they are evenly distributed throughout the sugar mixture. Working quickly, pour the hot mixture onto a parchment-lined or silicone baking mat-covered baking sheet, using a spatula or palette knife to create an even layer. While the mixture is still warm and malleable, carefully spread the melted chocolate over the top, making sure to cover the entire surface. You can also create swirls with the chocolate for a more decorative effect. Allow the chocolate peanut brittle to cool and harden at room temperature for approximately one to two hours or until it's completely set. You may also place it in the refrigerator to speed up the process; however, this may result in a slightly different texture. When the chocolate peanut brittle is completely set, break it into small, irregular pieces using your hands or a blunt object like a rolling pin. Store your homemade chocolate peanut brittle in an airtight container, kept in a cool, dry place, and enjoy it as a sweet, indulgent treat any time you wish!"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The reviewer appreciates the basic, ad-free design of the app. This is an important consideration for many users who prefer a more straightforward and undistracted gaming experience. By mentioning this, the reviewer provides potential users with valuable information about the app's user experience. 3.

At home it's a complete different ball game. He plays so much computer games at home that he needs a better computer. In his home computer he  installed the latest version of Windows. Now, there is no lag in his system.  and a hint : In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.

While practical jokes and pranks can sometimes be taken in good spirits, it appears that Tracy may have crossed a line, pushing Bailey to a point where they had had enough of being a target. Tracy's relentless antics had begun wearing on Bailey's emotional state and dignity, feeling humiliated by the constant barrage of pranks. As a result, Bailey grew increasingly frustrated, agitated, and unhappy with their situation. Over time, their patience wore thin, and Bailey had to weigh the options of either putting up with Tracy's behavior or planning a way to retaliate and teach them a lesson. Choosing the latter, Bailey decided to exact revenge on Tracy to regain some sense of power, as well as to hopefully put an end to the relentless cycle of humiliating pranks. By pulling down Tracy's pants in front of the entire class, Bailey believed that they would be evening the score and embarrassing Tracy in a way that they had been countless times before. This act was meant to send a clear message to Tracy that their hurtful behavior would no longer go unchallenged and had consequences. Despite feelings of irritation and frustration against Tracy, Bailey's choice to retaliate in such a public manner could be seen as excessive and ultimately regrettable. Seeking revenge may have seemed like a justifiable course of action in the heat of the moment, but attempting to resolve the issue through a more diplomatic approach could have resulted in a healthier resolution. In conclusion, Bailey's decision to pull Tracy's pants down in front of the whole class was a result of a growing sense of frustration and intolerance for the constant pranks Tracy would play on them. Bailey sought to take revenge on Tracy in an attempt to regain their dignity and send a clear message to their tormentor that their actions were no longer acceptable.

Experts question Trump's US military plan Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's US military buildup plan would cost hundreds of billions of dollars but with no apparent strategy, defence experts from across the political spectrum say. \\"I haven't seen any kind of strategy,\\" William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy said on Thursday. \\"He (Trump) says nobody is going to challenge us because we will be so strong. But that's not a strategy. It's just a kind of wish-fulfilment.\\" Asked to comment on the criticism, a Trump campaign adviser merely repeated Trump's plan. Trump's proposal, unveiled on Wednesday, did not spell out how he would accommodate the additional manpower and hardware as the United States shutters military bases, or where and for what purposes the larger forces would be employed. There were no cost estimates and Trump proposed revenue-raising steps that budget experts called insufficient. \\"He just called for higher defence spending without giving us a number and without telling us how he is going to pay for it,\\" Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan administration Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with the Obama administration, said. Trump's Democratic opponent in the November 8 election, Hillary Clinton, advocates tough defence and foreign policies, but has yet to take a stand on the size of the Pentagon budget. Trump has pledged to expand the US Army to 540,000 active-duty troops from its current 480,000, increase the Marine Corps from 23 to 36 battalions - or as many as 10,000 more Marines - boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise Air Force tactical aircraft from 1100 to 1200. He said he would bolster the development of missile defences and cyber capabilities. He made no mention of US nuclear forces already in the midst of a modernisation effort that will cost an estimated US1 (A1.3) trillion over 30 years. To pay for the buildup, Trump said he would ask Congress to lift a Pentagon budget cap and \\"fully offset\\" the increased costs by collecting unpaid taxes, cutting federal programs, cracking down on social welfare fraud and other frauds. The Trump campaign adviser, who requested anonymity, said the campaign estimated the cost of the expansion at US600 billion over 10 years. What was this article about?","output":"The article is about the proposed plan by then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for a significant buildup of the US military. According to the article, Trump's plan would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, but defense experts noted that there was no apparent strategy behind it. The plan was criticized for its lack of detail, particularly in terms of how he would accommodate the extra manpower and equipment, the deployment of the larger forces, and a lack of cost estimates. According to Trump's proposal, the US Army would be expanded to 540,000 active-duty troops from its current expanse of 480,000. He also planned to increase the Marine Corps from 23 to 36 battalions, effectively adding up to 10,000 more Marines. The Navy would be boosted from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and Air Force tactical aircraft would be increased from 1,100 to 1,200. Trump also mentioned an increased focus on the development of missile defenses and cyber capabilities. Trump suggested that he would ask Congress to eliminate a budget cap on the Pentagon to pay for this military expansion. He would also \\"fully offset\\" these costs by collecting unpaid taxes, cutting federal programs, and cracking down on social welfare fraud and other frauds. The Trump campaign's estimated cost for this multi-branch expansion was 600 billion over a decade. Among the critics, William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, denounced the plan for its lack of strategy. Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan administration Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, criticized it for suggesting higher defense spending without providing detailed payment plans.

After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: \\"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\\" He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March 1843.

Possible A: pine tree, open country, in washington, wildlife refuge, sky  Why is \\"wildlife refuge\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Wildlife refuge\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense for several reasons. A wildlife refuge is a designated area that is specifically managed and protected to provide a safe and suitable habitat for various species of wildlife, including birds like the bald eagle. Establishing such areas is a crucial measure taken by humans to ensure the long-term survival of several species, maintaining ecological balance, and promoting biodiversity. In a wildlife refuge, bald eagles receive the necessary protection from various threats that they may encounter elsewhere. These threats include, but are not limited to, habitat loss, pollution, poaching, and human disturbance. Wildlife refuges are often managed by conservationists, rangers, and organizations dedicated to the preservation of animals and their habitats. The other possible answers, like a pine tree, open country, in Washington, and sky, may provide temporary safety or opportunities for nesting and hunting; however, they do not necessarily guarantee long-term security as a wildlife refuge does: 1. Pine tree: A pine tree can be a suitable location for a bald eagle's nest, but it offers limited protection against human disturbances, predators, or environmental hazards. 2. Open country: Open country can offer vast expanses suited for hunting and nesting; however, without proper conservation measures in place, bald eagles may still face threats from human activities like logging or land development. 3. In Washington: While Washington is home to a significant population of bald eagles, the mere presence in a particular state doesn't equate to safety. Bald eagles may be found in both protected and unprotected areas within the state. 4. Sky: The sky is where eagles naturally hunt, fly, and travel, but it does not provide permanent safety or protection from potential dangers. As a result, when analyzing each option from a human common sense perspective, it becomes clear that \\"wildlife refuge\\" is the best answer, as it represents a dedicated and well-managed area aiming to ensure the bald eagle's safety and survival."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why were a lot of Midlanders out of work? Options:  A. people were going back to school to learn open source  B. OpenAdvantage was hiring all the workers  C. not enough information  D. industry was being automated and moved to Asia The answer to this question is:","output":"D. industry was being automated and moved to Asia"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - desktop - summer - moon - meadow - street  I believe the correct choice is \\"street\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"street,\\" and let me explain in detail why this is the most appropriate answer among the given options. 1. Desktop: A desktop typically refers to a table or workstation where a person places their computer, office supplies, or other materials necessary for work or study. Desktops are usually located indoors, and although they can be found near windows, they are generally not exposed to direct sunlight for a prolonged period. Besides, even if a desktop were heated by the sun, it is highly unlikely that James would be walking barefoot on it. 2. Summer: Summer is one of the four seasons and is characterized by warmer temperatures and longer days due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. Summer is not a tangible object or surface that someone could walk on, so it cannot be the correct answer. 3. Moon: The moon is Earth's natural satellite and is about 384,400 kilometers (238,900 miles) away from our planet. Humans would need specialized equipment and protection to walk on the moon. Additionally, moon temperatures can vary greatly, but the primary concern facing an astronaut on the lunar surface wouldn't be heat from the sunshine during the lunar day; instead, they would be more worried about the lack of air, pressure, and gravity. Therefore, the moon is not the correct answer. 4. Meadow: A meadow is an area of open land, often covered with grass and wildflowers, which can indeed be heated by sunshine during the day. However, walking barefoot through a meadow is not necessarily an uncomfortable experience due to the heat, as the soil retains less heat compared to hard surfaces, and the grass can act as a buffer. While walking on a heated meadow is possible, it's not as convincing as the street option. 5. Street: Streets are paved surfaces designed primarily for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. They are made from materials such as asphalt or concrete, which are excellent conductors of heat. When exposed to direct sunlight for prolonged periods, streets can become very hot, especially during the summer months. Walking barefoot on a heated street can be quite uncomfortable, even painful, as the heat from the surface transfers to the soles of the feet. Among all the given options, the \\"street\\" is the most logical choice to explain what James might have walked on barefoot when the surface was heated by the sunshine. This is due to the heat-retaining and conducting properties of street materials and the fact that street surfaces are likely to be more uncomfortable to walk on when heated than other alternatives, such as meadows."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

To this, Peirce added the concept of abductive reasoning. The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today. Peirce's approach \\"presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Take out everything that you brought into the house or apartment, including wall-mounted decorations and shelving units. Remove pictures, posters and decals from the walls. Check the closets and cabinets to make sure you haven’t left anything behind. Check your walls carefully and remove any tape, nails, picture hangers, or poster gum. Check for dirt, marks and smudges, especially if you have small children in the house. Use a duster to remove cobwebs. Scrub dirty areas with a gentle cleanser and a rag or soft sponge.  On latex paints, use a solution of water with a few drops of dish detergent, or a gallon (3.8 liters) of water mixed with 3-4 tablespoons (45-60 ml) of white vinegar. On tougher oil-based paints, like those used in kitchens, you can use a gentle degreaser. Use caution when cleaning around electrical fixtures, like light switches and outlet covers. Wring your sponge out carefully before attempting to clean these surfaces. You may wish to switch off your electricity at the circuit breaker before cleaning a dirty outlet cover. Use an all-purpose cleaner (like Formula 409) or specialized kitchen cleanser (like Bar Keepers Friend) and a gentle sponge or Magic Eraser to scrub your stove, refrigerator, and dishwasher (if you have one). If you can, remove bins and racks from your fridge and oven and wash them in the sink with a gentle detergent or a solution of warm water and baking soda. Take special care to clean your bathtub, shower, toilet, and sinks. Use Comet or a similar cleanser for plumbing fixtures, along with a gentle scrubber or magic eraser, to clean off soap scum, stains, and hard water deposits. For especially stubborn stains or deposits, you may need to let the cleanser sit for several minutes before you start scrubbing. A little bit of white vinegar mixed with water is also excellent for removing lime and soap scum. Wipe down your counters and the exteriors of your cabinets with a gentle cleanser and a rag or sponge. Areas around the handles of cabinets are especially prone to getting smudged and grimy. Don’t forget to clean out the insides of your cabinets, as well. For tough spots, use a mildly abrasive mixture of baking soda and water, and scrub with a soft brush. Spray your mirrors and windows with a glass cleaner (like Windex) and wipe them clean with a rag or sponge, making sure not to leave behind streaks or lint. You can also clean glass surfaces with a mixture of white vinegar and hot water. You may wish to save cleaning your floors for last, since cleaning walls and other surfaces can create a mess on the floor. Once you are ready, wipe up any wet spots on the floors. Sweep hard floor surfaces clean with a broom and dustpan. Vacuum any carpeted surfaces. Once you have swept, mop any hard floor surfaces with a traditional push mop or a steam mop. In areas that are especially prone to messy floors, like kitchens and bathrooms, you may wish to go over the floor more than once. Scrub any extra stubborn spots with a scrub brush and detergent. Take extra care when cleaning hardwood floors. Ask your landlord or property manager what type of finish is on your floor and get appropriate cleansers before attempting to clean it thoroughly.","output":"This article provides detailed step-by-step instructions on thoroughly cleaning a house or apartment, focusing on walls, appliances, plumbing fixtures, cabinets, windows, and floors to ensure a well-maintained living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: And the word for woman means a female of any age.  Given the two facts above, what happens when sperm swim from men's to women's reproductive organs? Choose your answer from: A). by indirect light; B). matter vibrating; C). death; D). competition; E). fertile crescent; F). fertilizer; G). permineralization; H). fertilization; The answer is:","output":"H). Fertilization. When sperm swim from the male's to the female's reproductive organs, they embark on a journey to combine with an egg produced by the female. This process, known as fertilization, results in the formation of a zygote, which is the initial stage of a new organism's development. The sperm are faced with various obstacles during their journey, such as the acidic environment of the vagina and the need to navigate the female reproductive tract. However, once a successful sperm unites with the egg, its genetic material combines with that of the egg, making the fertilization complete. The word \\"woman\\" signifies a female of any age, ranging from children to adult women. In terms of reproduction, only women who have reached puberty and have begun menstruating are capable of producing eggs and partaking in the fertilization process. As a woman's reproductive system matures, her body initiates menstrual cycles, during which one or more eggs are released from the ovaries to prepare for potential fertilization. If sperm is introduced during this period, fertilization can take place, and pregnancy may occur. The other options provided, such as indirect light, matter vibrating, and death, do not directly pertain to the process of sperm swimming from a male's to a female's reproductive organs. Similarly, terms like the Fertile Crescent, a historical region in the Middle East known for its agricultural productivity, and permineralization, a process where minerals gradually replace organic tissue, are not relevant to the context of human fertilization. Lastly, competition may be considered as a part of the process, as millions of sperm compete to fertilize the egg, but the correct answer focuses on the result of this competition, which is fertilization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sometimes, it starts to smell bad because of everything it has eaten. So, we need to give it something that will take away the smell. We have two ways to do this: (a) First, we can make soda ice cubes. Soda is like a magic powder that helps to take away bad smells. We will turn it into ice cubes and then feed it to the monster (garbage disposal). When the monster chews on these ice cubes, the soda will get everywhere inside and help remove the bad smell. (b) Secondly, we can make vinegar ice cubes. Vinegar is like a superhero liquid that fights against bad smells. Turning it into ice cubes and giving it to the monster (garbage disposal) will also work. As the monster chews on these ice cubes, the vinegar will get all over inside it and help take away the bad smell.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nucleus of an atom. This releases a huge amount of energy.   Q: Splitting the nucleus of an atom produces a massive amount of what type of energy?   A: The answer is:","output":"Splitting the nucleus of an atom produces a massive amount of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is a powerful and concentrated form of energy harnessed from the atomic nucleus, which is the central core of an atom. The process of splitting the nucleus of an atom, also known as nuclear fission, involves breaking apart the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus. This releases a significant amount of energy, primarily in the form of heat and radiation. The huge amount of energy released during nuclear fission can be attributed to the strong nuclear force that binds the nucleus together. This force is incredibly strong to keep the protons and neutrons in the nucleus bound despite the repulsive forces between the positively charged protons. When the nucleus is split, a tiny mass is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², where E represents energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light. As a result, the energy produced by nuclear fission is about a million times greater than that of chemical reactions such as combustion. This makes nuclear energy a powerful and efficient source of electricity as well as an essential resource for various applications, including medical treatments, research, and even powering spacecraft. However, it's important to note that nuclear energy also comes with several risks and challenges, such as the long-term storage and disposal of nuclear waste, the potential for nuclear accidents, and the possibility of nuclear proliferation. Despite these challenges, nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon energy source and, if managed responsibly, could potentially contribute to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the 1927 case Olmstead v. United States, in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping. After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non-consensual phone tapping, but allowed bugging. In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After the 1967 case Katz v. United States overturned the 1927 case that had allowed bugging, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations as long as they obtain a warrant beforehand. What tool did Hoover use to find bootleggers?","output":"J. Edgar Hoover, the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), used wiretapping as a tool to find and arrest bootleggers during the 1920s Prohibition era. Wiretapping involves the monitoring and recording of telephone conversations without the consent of the parties involved. This method enabled the FBI to gather evidence against those involved in the illegal production, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages, which was prohibited under the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In the 1927 case of Olmstead v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unlawful searches and seizures, as long as the agency did not physically enter a person's home to conduct the tapping. This decision gave the FBI the legal authority to use wiretaps in their efforts to apprehend bootleggers and dismantle their operations. However, after the repeal of Prohibition, the Communications Act of 1934 was passed, which prohibited non-consensual phone tapping but still allowed bugging. In 1939, the court ruled in the Nardone v. United States case that FBI-obtained evidence via phone tapping was inadmissible in court due to the 1934 law. Eventually, in the 1967 case of Katz v. United States, the previous ruling from the 1927 Olmstead case was overturned, which led to Congress passing the Omnibus Crime Control Act.

What is the sentiment of the following review? If you're looking for an inexpensive, tasty lunch in the Strip at a sit down restaurant, give Chicken Latino a try!  I came here for lunch today with a friend, and we ordered the half Peruvian rotisserie chicken, yucca fries, and fried plantains, which was more than enough for the two of us.  I also had a bottle of Inca Cola, which I hadn't had since studying abroad in Quito in 2006.  We enjoyed the chicken, which I found tender and well-seasoned, particularly on the skin, particularly with the green sauce, which we mixed with mayo to cut the spiciness.  The yucca fries were also great with the sauce.  I wasn't as much of a fan of the plantains (too sweet), but this is probably an idiosyncratic matter, since I don't really care for bananas much.  All this food set us back about 20, which is pretty inexpensive for a sit down meal, though there is cheaper street food to be had nearby.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful, helping us make decisions by making  suggestions.  I also enjoyed the wall hangings, which reminded me of the textiles available at indigenous markets in Ecuador.  One suggestion for improvement would be to have mayo available in squeeze bottles, similar to the green sauce, since tearing open packets is a pain and creates unnecessary waste.

The reviewer praises Chicken Latino for its affordability and delicious food. They specifically mention enjoying the half Peruvian rotisserie chicken, yucca fries, and Inca Cola, with the chicken being tender and well-seasoned. The green sauce, which the reviewer mixed with mayo to cut the spiciness, is also highlighted as a positive aspect of the meal. The reviewer does note that they were not a big fan of the fried plantains due to personal taste preferences, but this seems to be a minor point in the context of the overall positive review. They acknowledge that their dislike for the plantains is likely an idiosyncratic matter, as they do not particularly care for bananas. The affordability of the meal is also praised, as the reviewer states that spending about 20 for a sit-down meal is quite inexpensive, even if there are cheaper street food options nearby. They also express appreciation for the friendly and helpful waiter who made suggestions to assist them in their decisions. The reviewer mentions the pleasant atmosphere provided by the wall hangings, which reminded them of textiles available at indigenous markets in Ecuador. However, they do offer a suggestion for improvement: providing mayo in squeeze bottles instead of packets, which would be more convenient and generate less waste. In summary, the sentiment of this review is mainly positive, with a focus on the tasty and inexpensive food, the friendly service, and the enjoyable atmosphere at Chicken Latino.

Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh. The flotilla was broken up by a storm. As the flagship, the Sea Venture, was taking on water, Somers drove it onto Bermuda's reef and gained the shores safely with smaller boats – all 150 passengers and a dog survived. (William Shakespeare's play The Tempest, in which the character Ariel refers to the \\"still-vex'd Bermoothes\\" (I.ii.229), is thought to have been inspired by William Strachey's account of this shipwreck.)

Question: Question: what is life all about I found the following answer on Google: Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe , exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct in the context of scientific contributions dealing with the empirical facts about life and the universe. It is important to note that this is just one perspective on the meaning of life, and there are a variety of other perspectives one could consider. Science, as a discipline, is dedicated to acquiring knowledge through empirical research, experimentation, and observation. It aims to understand how life works at a fundamental level, focusing on the physical and biological processes governing living organisms and their environments. In this pursuit, scientists work to uncover the underlying mechanisms and laws that shape the world around us. While the scientific perspective deals with the 'how' of life, other perspectives touch on the broader question of what life is all about. These perspectives may have different views that can complement or contradict each other, but each offers unique insights into the meaning of life. Philosophical perspectives often engage with questions about the nature of existence, consciousness, and purpose. Major schools of thought, including existentialism, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics, provide different frameworks for understanding our place in the world and what drives our actions. Religious and spiritual perspectives may provide guidance on the purpose and meaning of life by offering insights from holy texts, teachings, and traditions. At their core, these perspectives usually aim to help individuals achieve a sense of fulfilment or inner peace through the cultivation of virtues, morals, and ethics. Cultural perspectives can help us understand how different societies and groups of people approach the question of life's meaning. By analyzing values, norms, and belief systems, one can gain greater insight into the ways in which culture shapes our understanding of life's meaning. Artistic and creative perspectives provide additional ways to express and explore the meaning of life, often communicating complex ideas and emotions through diverse mediums such as painting, music, literature, and film. In summary, the scientific answer you found is correct concerning the empirical facts about the universe and the context of the 'how' of life. However, one should also consider the varied philosophical, religious, cultural, and artistic perspectives that contribute to the broader conversation about the meaning of life. Each of these viewpoints brings its unique insights, enriching our understanding of this fundamental question that has captivated the human imagination for millennia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If your knife has a fixed handle, you may need to carefully cut away the original handle material. Step 3: Trace and cut the handle material Place the knife blade onto the water resistant material, making sure to align it properly. Trace the outline of the handle onto the material with a marker or pencil. Use a saw or cutting tool to cut the material along the traced lines. If your handle has two halves, repeat this process for the second half. Step 4: Sand the handle pieces Using sandpaper, smooth the edges and surfaces of the handle pieces. This will help the adhesive to bond better and will also ensure a comfortable grip. Step 5: Apply adhesive Apply a thin, even layer of epoxy or water resistant adhesive to one side of one of the handle pieces. Place the blade onto this piece, ensuring proper alignment. Apply a thin layer of adhesive to the other handle piece and place it onto the blade, sandwiching the blade between the two handle pieces. Step 6: Clamp and cure Use clamps or weights to apply even pressure to the handle pieces, ensuring a strong bond between the pieces and the blade. Follow the adhesive manufacturer's instructions for curing time (usually 24 to 48 hours). Step 7: Final sanding and finishing Once the adhesive has cured, remove the clamps or weights. Use sandpaper to smooth any excess adhesive and to shape the handle to your desired contours. If you desire, you can apply a water resistant finish or sealant to the handle for an added layer of protection.

Answer the following question: WASHINGTON — They called themselves \\"crusaders\\" for a reason. The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Is In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, \\"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski.\\" a good answer to this question?","output":"The question asks about a fellow Vienna native who was friends with Friedrich Hayek, an Austrian-British economist, and philosopher. The given quote is a part of a letter from Karl Popper to Hayek in 1944, which can be used as evidence to establish their friendship. However, to provide a detailed and long answer, further information on Karl Popper and his relationship with Hayek should be included.  Karl Popper was an Austrian-British philosopher and professor, born in Vienna, Austria. He is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, particularly in the philosophy of science and political philosophy. His notable works include \\"The Logic of Scientific Discovery,\\" \\"The Open Society and Its Enemies,\\" and \\"Conjectures and Refutations.\\" Popper and Hayek were both members of the 'Vienna Circle,' a group of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians who formed around the philosopher Moritz Schlick in the 1920s. This group aimed to establish a scientific worldview based on empirical evidence, mathematical logic, and clarity of language. Although Popper and Hayek held differing philosophical viewpoints – Popper being a proponent of critical rationalism and Hayek advocating for classical liberalism – they shared several commonalities. Both individuals fled Europe during the rise of the Nazi regime to continue their work in Britain. Throughout their lives, they corresponded with each other and attended conferences together, indicating a close intellectual friendship. One significant collaboration between Popper and Hayek was their engagement in the Mont Pelerin Society, which Hayek co-founded in 1947. This organization aimed to bring together intellectuals to discuss and promote the ideas of liberty and free market economics. Popper was an active participant and greatly contributed to the shaping of the Society's philosophy, alongside Hayek. This collaboration further emphasized their friendship and the mutual influence they had on each other's work. To conclude, the fellow Vienna native Hayek was friends with is Karl Popper, a prominent philosopher who shared intellectual interests with Hayek. The quote from Popper's letter shows their mutual respect and influence on each other. Their shared background in the Vienna Circle, their collaboration in the Mont Pelerin Society, and years of correspondence exemplify their friendship and intellectual camaraderie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This week marked the return of former Eagles head coach Andy Reid. The Eagles forced the Chiefs to a quick three-and-out, but the Eagles miffed the punt, and the Chiefs recovered at the Philadelphia 8. A few plays later, Ryan Succop kicked a 33-yard field goal. On Philadelphia's first possession, Michael Vick was intercepted by Eric Berry, on a pass intended for Brent Celek, who returned it 38 yards for a touchdown. After a Chiefs punt, Michael Vick busted off a 61-yard run, setting up his 22-yard touchdown pass to Jason Avant. Zach Ertz attempted to run in the 2 pt. conversion, but failed, keeping the score 10-6. With less than a minute remaining in the first quarter the Eagles drove into Chiefs territory, but Vick was sacked by Justin Houston and fumbled. Two field goals by Ryan Succop was the only scoring of the second quarter, giving the Chiefs a 16-6 halftime lead.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The egg hatches to form a larva, also called a caterpillar - The carterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows - The caterpillar then forms itself into a pupa, or chrysalis - The caterpillar in the chrysalis begins change, a process called mmetaphorphosis - The caterpillar completes its metamorphosis and has turned into a butterfly - The adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flys away! -","output":"The missing first step in the process is: Female butterfly deposits eggs on a suitable host plant. To provide a comprehensive understanding, here's the complete butterfly life cycle with the missing step: 1. Female butterfly deposits eggs on a suitable host plant: The process begins when a female butterfly identifies a suitable host plant to lay her eggs. The chosen plant is typically one on which the caterpillar can feed and grow. The female butterfly carefully places her eggs, often on the underside of leaves or other hidden spots, to protect them from predators and harsh environmental conditions. 2. The egg hatches to form a larva, also called a caterpillar: After a few days to weeks, depending on the species and environmental conditions, the egg hatches and a tiny caterpillar emerges. The caterpillar's first meal is often the eggshell itself, followed by the host plant's leaves. 3. The caterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows: The caterpillar goes through several stages, called instars, as it grows. It molts its exoskeleton each time it outgrows it in order to make room for the larger body. During this period, the caterpillar focuses on eating leaves and growing as much as possible. 4. The caterpillar then forms itself into a pupa, or chrysalis: When the caterpillar has reached its full size, it begins the process of forming a pupa or chrysalis. The caterpillar attaches itself to a secure surface, such as a branch or a leaf, and sheds its final caterpillar skin, revealing the chrysalis underneath. The pupa becomes hard, providing protection for the developing butterfly inside. 5. The caterpillar in the chrysalis begins change, a process called metamorphosis: Within the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes a remarkable transformation called metamorphosis. Its organ systems, tissues, and body structures change drastically, to make way for the adult butterfly. During this stage, the caterpillar develops wings, compound eyes, and a proboscis - the long, coiled structure used for feeding on nectar. 6. The caterpillar completes its metamorphosis and has turned into a butterfly: After a certain period, depending on the species, the chrysalis becomes transparent, and the adult butterfly can be seen inside. 7. The adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flies away: The final step of the life cycle occurs when the butterfly breaks out of the chrysalis. It carefully unfolds and expands its wings by pumping fluid from its abdomen into the wing veins. Once the wings are fully expanded and dry, the adult butterfly is ready to take its first flight, beginning the cycle anew by seeking a mate and laying eggs on a suitable host plant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. So many social errors could be avoided if only more thought were involved. A truly gifted conversationalist will always try to filter what he says before he finally says it. While thinking about everything you're going to say may sound exhausting to some, it doesn't require a lot of brainpower. Really, all you'll usually need is a split-second to figure whether something you say might negatively affect someone around you. If you have a bad feeling about saying something, it's best to keep your mouth shut for the time being. It may help to be conscious of the way your voice is sounding when you speak. While it may be distracting to focus on yourself when you're trying to have a conversation, casually keeping track of the tone, speed and volume of your voice can go a long way towards preventing unintentional rudeness. In particular, be careful with your talking speed. Nervous or awkward people tend to accelerate their speech when they're under pressure. This only serves to add to the awkwardness. There's a lot empathy can do for you in a conversation. Being seen as polite and considerate isn't least among the benefits. Empathy is something virtually everyone has to some extent. The key to bringing it out is to invest a legitimate interest in what the other person is saying. If someone is telling you something about his life, make a concerted effort to see things from his point of view. If he recently lost his job, for example, try to empathize with how that might feel. Empathetic people are in tune with the other person's feelings and it's easier to charm them as such. Empathy works in less-than-pleasant interactions as well. It can be frustrating to talk to someone who is being aggressive or mean-spirited. While it can be easy to let loose on someone like that, you can have an easier time keeping calm by using empathy. Try to see the situation from the unpleasant person's point-of-view. In some cases, you may have a new lease on the situation by taking yourself out of your own perspective for a bit. Gossip is a quick route to rudeness. No one likes being talked about. Even if the subject in question isn't around to hear it, many people take offence to hearing people they know talked about in a negative light. If you want to avoid rudeness on your part, you should steer clear of interactions like this. Even if other people are gossiping, you should turn the other cheek. Those who are there to see you refuse the prospect will think more highly of you as a result. Modesty is a virtue for virtually all polite people. Some people are rude for the fact that they focus too much on themselves. This is most often an innocent fault, but it's one that can easily be avoided if you try to look at the conversation from both perspectives. Even if everything you're saying is gold, you'll still come across as rude if you don't think to hear the other person's side of things. As a general rule, people like to voice their opinions. They'll feel constricted if they can't get a word in. Listening is a skill, as real as any other. If you don't want to be rude, you'll need to have a fine command of listening. Active listening refers to a broad range of reactions that let the other person know you are giving him your fullest attention. This can include body language, such as nodding your head, or soft responses like repeating the gist of what the other person said can get this point across.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of thinking before speaking, empathy, avoiding gossip, modesty, and active listening in order to be a polite and considerate conversationalist."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we need to make \\"g\\" all by itself on one side of the \\"=\\" sign. So, we'll start by moving the -4450 to the other side, where the -4195 is. When we move a number from one side of the \\"=\\" sign to the other side, its sign changes. So, -4450 becomes +4450. Now, our equation looks like this: -4195 + 4450 = 17 * g 2. Now, we need to do the math. What's -4195 + 4450? The answer is +255. 255 = 17 * g 3. Alright, we're close! We just need to solve for \\"g\\" now. We have this: 255 = 17 * g To find \\"g\\", we need to do the opposite of multiplication. The opposite of multiplication is division. So, we'll divide 255 by 17 to find out what \\"g\\" is.

Math Problem Solve 63*l + 239 = -265 for l.","output":"Sure, let's solve the math problem step by step like a puzzle! We have the equation: 63 * l + 239 = -265 First, we need to isolate \\"l\\" (find out what number it is). To do this, let's get rid of the \\"+239\\" from one side of the equation. We'll subtract 239 from both sides: 63 * l + 239 - 239 = -265 - 239 63 * l = -504 Now, we are left with \\"63 * l = -504.\\" What this means is that we need to find out what number \\"l\\" is when we multiply it by 63 to get -504.  To find \\"l,\\" we'll divide both sides of the equation by 63: (63 * l) / 63 = -504 / 63 l = -8 So, the answer is l = -8.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Lil Wayne has been referenced in public speeches by President Barack Obama on at least two occasions, in mixed contexts. Speaking to a largely African-American audience during a general election campaign town hall speech in Georgia, then-U.S. Senator Obama exhorted children to stay in school and achieve their dreams through education and perseverance instead of hoping for shortcuts to fame and riches as professional athletes and entertainers via the fields of sports and entertainment, stating: \\"You are probably not that good a rapper. Maybe you are the next Lil Wayne, but probably not, in which case you need to stay in school.\\"  After assuming the Presidency, Obama later echoed this theme of personal and familial responsibility and the difficulty of achieving Lil Wayne's professional and financial success--during an address to a meeting commemorating the 100th anniversary of the NAACP, telling the audience:  They might think they've got a pretty jump shot or a pretty good flow, but our kids can't all aspire to be LeBron or Lil Wayne. I want them aspiring to be scientists and engineers, doctors and teachers, not just ballers and rappers. I want them aspiring to be a Supreme Court justice. I want them aspiring to be President of the United States of America.  Obama has also noted that the music on his iPod includes Lil Wayne:  My rap palate has greatly improved.

Summarize: Resealable plastic bags make excellent piping bags because the frosting or sauce won't come out from anywhere but the point that you want it to. Select a plastic bag based on the amount of frosting or sauce that you need to apply to the top of your dish.  Most packages list the interior volume of the plastic bag. This can make it easy to determine whether a bag is big enough for the recipe. A thicker resealable bag, like a freezer bag, is a good choice if you have a thicker frosting that will require a lot pressure to be applied to the bag. You can use a non-sealable plastic bag if that's all you have available, but you'll need to twist it at the top once you fill it to close it. These bags also tend to explode when you squeeze them, so they're not great for thicker frostings. Once you've added your frosting or sauce, seal your bag by running your fingers on the opposite sides of the seal and pressing it together. If you have a plastic bag with a zipper, all you need to do is slide it to the other end of the bag. Push the frosting, icing, or sauce down towards the corner that you're going to cut. You can push the air out before sealing it if you want. It'll make it easier to dispense the icing or sauce but it will also come out quicker.","output":"Resealable plastic bags are highly effective when used as piping bags for decorating dishes with frostings or sauces due to the precise control they offer. When choosing a plastic bag, consider the quantity required for your dish and pick a bag with adequate interior volume. Packages often provide this information for easy reference. Selecting a thicker resealable bag, like a freezer bag, is ideal for dense frostings that need more pressure to dispense. Non-sealable plastic bags can also be used in case resealable ones are unavailable, but they offer less control and may need to be twisted at the top to seal. These bags are prone to bursting, making them less ideal for thicker frostings. After filling your chosen bag with the frosting or sauce, seal it properly by pressing the edges together or by sliding the zipper (if available).

Question: What does the search party discover? Movie title: The Hills Have Eyes 2 Movie plot: A captive womanâforced to breed mutant childrenâgives birth to a stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon. Chameleon attempts to rape her, but Missy fights...

Henry Hill, Jr. was born on June 11, 1943 in Manhattan, New York, to Henry Hill, Sr., an Irish immigrant and electrician, and Carmela Costa Hill, a Sicilian. The working-class family consisted of Henry and his eight siblings who grew up in Brownsville, a poorer area of the East New York section of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job. On April 27, 1980, Hill was arrested on a narcotics-trafficking charge. He became convinced that his former associates planned to have him killed: Vario, for dealing drugs; and Burke, to prevent Hill from implicating him in the Lufthansa Heist. Hill heard on a wiretap that his associates Angelo Sepe and Anthony Stabile were anxious to have him killed, and that they were telling Burke that Hill \\"is no good\\", and that he \\"is a junkie\\". Burke told them \\"not to worry about it\\". Hill was more convinced by a surveillance tape played to him by federal investigators, in which Burke tells Vario of their need to have Hill \\"whacked.\\" But Hill still wouldn't talk to the investigators. While in his cell, the officers would tell Hill that the prosecutor, Ed McDonald, wanted to speak with him, and Hill would yell: \\"Fuck you and McDonald\\". Hill became even more paranoid because he thought Burke had officers on the inside and would have him killed.  While Karen was worried, she kept getting calls from Jimmy Burke's wife, Mickey, asking when Hill was coming home, or if Karen needed anything. Hill knew the calls were prompted by Jimmy.  When Hill was finally released on bail, he met Burke at a restaurant they always went to. Burke told Hill that they should meet at a bar Hill had never heard of or seen before, owned by \\"Charlie the Jap\\". However, Hill never met Burke there; instead they met at Burke's sweatshop with Karen and asked for the address in Florida where Hill was to kill Bobby Germaine's son with Anthony Stabile. Hill knew he was going to get killed in Florida, but he needed to stay on the streets to make money.  McDonald didn't want to take any chances and arrested Hill as a material witness in the Lufthansa robbery. Hill then agreed to become an informant and signed an agreement with the United States Department of Justice Organized Crime Strike Force on May 27, 1980. In 2011, former junior mob associate Greg Bucceroni alleged that, after Hill's 1980 arrest, Jimmy Burke offered him money to arrange a meeting between Bucceroni and Hill at a Brooklyn grocery store so that Burke could have Hill murdered gangland fashion, but Bucceroni decided quietly against having any involvement with the hit on Hill. Shortly afterwards, Burke and several other Lucchese crime family members were arrested by federal authorities.","output":"This text is about Henry Hill, Jr., a former mobster who eventually became an informant for the United States Department of Justice Organized Crime Strike Force."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A very brave and strong man named Sergeant Dave Kent has just done an incredible thing! He broke the record for the deepest dive by a British person, and he did it without any help. Can you imagine going underwater really, really deep without any oxygen, flippers, or goggles? Sounds like a superhero, doesn't it? Well, Sergeant Kent is almost like a superhero because he freedived 230 feet deep. That's about as long as two blue whales laid end to end! He didn't use any oxygen to help him breathe, and he didn't have flippers to swim faster or goggles to see better. He just used his own strength, skills, and bravery to reach that depth.

The game offers a nice throwback to classic dungeon crawlers, with a pixel art aesthetic and randomly generated levels that add a fair amount of variety and replay value.  The automated combat system is fairly standard, and while it doesn't innovate in any significant way, there is still a decent sense of challenge when facing some of the more difficult monsters. In addition, the selection of classes and skills is enjoyable, but I believe it could use some expansion for a more comprehensive experience. However, there are a few areas that need improvement. The user interface tends to be a bit clunky, particularly when navigating menus or selecting items, which can be frustrating during intense in-game moments. While the game is quite enjoyable for short bursts, I found the long-term appeal to be somewhat limited – possible updates to the story or additional content could enhance the overall experience. Additionally, I encountered occasional crashes that forced me to quit the app and restart, which interrupted the flow of gameplay. I would appreciate it if the developers worked on addressing these stability issues in future updates. In conclusion, Pixel Dungeon has a strong foundation and could appeal to fans of classic dungeon crawlers. However, it does need some polish and improvements in certain areas in order to reach its full potential. With a few tweaks and updates, this app could easily gain an extra star or two.

Cursham had a reasonably brief but noteworthy career in first-class cricket, playing for both Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire between 1876 and 1880. Cursham's skill on the cricket field quickly saw him rise to prominence. He made his debut for Nottinghamshire on August 28, 1876, in a match against Yorkshire. Over the years, he participated in 21 first-class matches, consistently demonstrating his prowess as a cricketer and racking up an impressive 314 runs during his career. Though his primary role was as a batsman, Cursham occasionally dabbled in bowling and managed to secure a wicket during his time on the field. As a first-class cricketer, Cursham achieved several notable feats during his four-year stint. One of his most significant milestones was in 1876 when he played for Nottinghamshire against archrival Derbyshire. A few years later, he switched sides and played for Derbyshire in their match against Kent in 1880. Cursham's last appearance as a first-class cricketer was on August 26, 1880. Despite his undeniable talent as a cricketer, Cursham met a tragic end. He passed away on December 24, 1884, in Florida, United States, at the age of 31. His short but impactful life left a mark on cricket history, and he is still remembered by those passionate about the sport.

Who is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous?  Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Answer:","output":"To determine who is exposed to more dangerous sounds, let's first consider the hint provided. High-decibel sounds are dangerous and can damage the ears and cause hearing loss. For every 10-decibel increase in intensity, loudness is 10 times greater. Step 1: Understand the work environments Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine, which are known to produce high-decibel sounds. Alexander works in a library, where he is exposed to low-decibel sounds most of the time. Step 2: Compare sound levels in each environment Since a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper, it can be safely assumed that the decibel levels produced by a jackhammer and a large welding machine would be significantly higher than the decibel levels in a library. Step 3: Identify the person exposed to more dangerous sounds Given that high-decibel sounds are dangerous, and Jeremy is exposed to high-decibel sounds due to operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine at the construction site, Jeremy is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous compared to Alexander who works in a library with low-decibel sounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Which was the first X-rated film to win an Oscar for Best Picture?","output":"The first X-rated film to win an Oscar for Best Picture was \\"Midnight Cowboy,\\" released in 1969. This groundbreaking film was directed by John Schlesinger and starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in the leading roles. The narrative follows the young Texan cowboy Joe Buck (played by Voight) who moves to New York City with dreams of becoming a successful male prostitute. He eventually befriends Enrico \\"Ratso\\" Rizzo (played by Hoffman), a small-time hustler with a limp who helps him navigate the harsh realities of the city. \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" was initially given an X rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) due to its explicit subject matter, which revolved around the themes of sex work and gritty urban life. The X rating signified that the movie was intended for audiences aged 18 and older. However, this initial rating did not prevent the film from receiving critical acclaim and commercial success. In fact, it went on to gross over 44 million at the box office, with a production budget of just under 4 million. The Academy Award for Best Picture was presented to \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" at the 42nd Academy Awards, held on April 7, 1970, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. This marked the first and only time that an X-rated film was awarded the prestigious accolade. In addition to winning the Best Picture Oscar, the film also garnered two other Oscars: Best Director for John Schlesinger and Best Adapted Screenplay for Waldo Salt. Furthermore, both leading actors, Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, received nominations for Best Actor but did not win. The historical significance of \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" lies not only in its triumph at the Oscars but also in its lasting impact on the film industry. It has since been considered as one of the pioneering films of the New Hollywood era, a period in American cinema characterized by a shift towards more daring and controversial subjects. The film's narrative and visual style are also credited with influencing later works that explored themes of social realism and the American dream. Following the film's Oscar win, the MPAA re-examined its rating system and eventually revised the X rating, which led to the creation of the NC-17 rating in 1990. This change aimed to differentiate more mature and explicit content from outright adult entertainments. Consequently, \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" was re-rated to R in 1971, and the film remains a landmark piece of American cinema to this day for its reception, influence, and the unique distinction of being the first and only X-rated film to win an Oscar for Best Picture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \\"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\\" answer the question \\"What was Serbo-Croatian the official language for in the 20th century?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \\"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\\" answers the question \\"What was Serbo-Croatian the official language for in the 20th century?\\" To expand on the answer, the 20th century witnessed significant political changes in the Balkan region, where the Serbo-Croatian language was spoken predominantly by ethnic Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks.  In the early 20th century, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was created after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I. In 1929, the kingdom was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and Serbo-Croatian, referred to as \\"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\\" at the time, served as the official language. The unification of these South Slavic nations aimed to create a unified identity, and the standardization of the Serbo-Croatian language played a crucial role in fostering this goal. Following World War II and the establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbo-Croatian continued to function as one of the official languages, along with Slovene and Macedonian. This newly formed country consisted of six republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Each republic had a distinct language and culture, but Serbo-Croatian remained an essential tool for communication and exercising political power. The 1991-1995 Yugoslav Wars led to the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the eventual creation of several independent countries. Following the dissolution of this political entity, the once widely-accepted Serbo-Croatian language began to disintegrate into different languages, reflecting the ethnic and political divisions among the former Yugoslav republics. Today, the term Serbo-Croatian is less commonly used, and the languages that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia are now usually referred to as separate languages: Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. Despite the many similarities and mutual intelligibility among these newly distinguished languages, they now function as distinct official languages in their respective countries: Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. In conclusion, during the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language for two different political entities: the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (earlier called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This language played a crucial role in shaping a South Slavic identity but eventually gave way to separate languages following a series of political and social transformations in the Balkans."},{"instruction":"Context: Casey went back to bed after drinking water and had a dream about the upcoming election.

To further clarify, it is important to delve into the nuances of both statements and provide more context underlying the reason the individual might not have believed the information. The statement \\"For one thing he probably wouldn't have believed it\\" carries an element of uncertainty with the word \\"probably,\\" suggesting that the speaker is not entirely sure about the individual's reaction to the information. There could be myriad reasons why the individual might not have believed the information. Some of these reasons might include: 1. The individual has a skeptical nature and doubts most information presented to them, regardless of the source or the information's believability. 2. Previous experiences may have led the individual to be distrustful of the source providing the information, making them less likely to believe the information even if it were plausible. 3. The information might contradict the individual's beliefs, values, or previous knowledge, causing them to reject it based on their internal biases rather than evaluating its believability. On the other hand, the statement \\"The information presented was very believable\\" implies a sense of credibility associated with the information. This statement suggests that the information is reliable, well-supported, and aligns with relevant facts or evidence. Essentially, the information is not far-fetched or difficult to accept because it seems very plausible. However, despite the apparent believability of the information, the original statement does not confirm that the individual would find it convincing. In summary, the statement \\"For one thing he probably wouldn't have believed it\\" does not allow us to conclude that \\"The information presented was very believable.\\" While the information might indeed be believable, the individual's personal beliefs, experiences, or skepticism might lead them to doubt the information, irrespective of its believability. To reach a definitive conclusion, further information about the individual's opinion and the context of the information being presented would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.  - Pet Force is a series of books for young readers. It is a spin-off of \\"Garfield\\", in which the main animal characters of the comic series are portrayed as comic book superheroes. The action takes place on planet Polyester.  - A DVD player is a device that plays discs produced under both the DVD-Video and DVD-Audio technical standards, two different and incompatible standards.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems.  - Toshiba was founded in 1938 as Tokyo Shibaura Electric K.K. through the merger of Shibaura Seisaku-sho (founded in 1875) and Tokyo Denki (founded in 1890).

A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.   - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - In modern popular fiction, a superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of costumed heroic character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.

A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (سجع, also transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the Arabic saj' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was Muhayyelât (\\"Fancies\\") by Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi, a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was by an Armenian named Vartan Pasha.

Answer a question about this article: The bacillus causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, was identified and described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch. He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery. Koch did not believe the bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a \\"remedy\\" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it \\"tuberculin\\". While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis. The World Tuberculosis Day was established on 24 March for this reason.

Here are possible answers to this question: - library - drawer - dentist - bed - airport  I believe the correct choice is \\"bed\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"bed\\", here's why: The question refers to the common stereotype that young boys tend to hide their dirty magazines in secret places where they think nobody will find them. Out of the provided options, \\"bed\\" seems to be the most plausible answer. Firstly, \\"bed\\" represents a location typically associated with privacy and personal space in a household, making it a logical place for a young boy to hide sensitive materials. Boys may choose to hide magazines under their mattresses, inside the pillowcases, or among their bedsheets to keep them concealed from parents or siblings. In contrast, the other options suggested are less likely to be chosen by young boys due to various reasons: 1. Library: A public place where many people come in and out, making it an unsuitable place to hide personal items, let alone dirty magazines. 2. Drawer: Although a drawer is a possible hiding spot, it is relatively less secretive than a bed. Parents or siblings might easily look into drawers for various reasons, increasing the risk of the magazines being discovered. 3. Dentist: This option seems unrealistic because a dentist's office is a professional environment, and young boys would have no reason to hide personal items, especially dirty magazines, at such a location. 4. Airport: Similar to the library, an airport is a public area with high levels of security and surveillance, which makes it an extremely impractical choice for hiding sensitive materials. Based on the reasons outlined above, the most probable answer to the question of where young boys hide dirty magazines would be \\"bed.\\" Keep in mind, though, that this question perpetuates a stereotype, and each individual may have their distinct method of hiding personal items."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution? Solve -o + 5*o = o for o.","output":"Alright, let's break down this problem step by step! We have a little math problem here: -o + 5*o = o First, let's understand what this means:  1. \\"-o\\" means \\"minus one o\\" 2. \\"5*o\\" means \\"five times o\\" 3. \\"o\\" is just \\"one o\\" The problem is asking us to find out what \\"o\\" is. Let's solve it: Step 1: We have -o and 5*o on the left side of the equation. We can combine them: (-1 + 5)*o = 4*o (Because -1 plus 5 equals 4) So now, the problem looks like this: 4*o = o Step 2: To solve for \\"o\\", we need to get rid of the 4 on the left side. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: (4*o) / 4 = (o) / 4 This simplifies to: o = o/4 Step 3: Now, we have to find out what number \\"o\\" is. If we look closely, we can see that \\"o\\" is the same on both sides of the equation. This means that the only number that works for \\"o\\" is 0.

Answer:","output":"The last step of this process is the glucose being transported to the body's cells to be used as a source of energy. Once the glucose has been released into the blood by the liver, it circulates throughout the body and reaches various cells and tissues. The hormone insulin, which is also produced by the pancreas, facilitates the uptake of glucose by these cells. The cells then metabolize the glucose to produce energy (in the form of ATP) needed for various cellular activities.

The ESET (also called SETDB1) protein contains an N-terminal tudor domain that mediates protein-protein interactions and a C-terminal SET domain that catalyzes methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9. We report here that ESET protein is transiently upregulated in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in newborn mice. To investigate the in vivo effects of ESET on chondrocyte differentiation, we generated conditional knockout mice to specifically eliminate the catalytic SET domain of ESET protein only in mesenchymal cells. Such deletion of the ESET gene caused acceleration of chondrocyte hypertrophy in both embryos and young animals, depleting chondrocytes that are otherwise available to form epiphyseal plates for endochondral bone growth. ESET-deficient mice are thus characterized by defective long bone growth and trabecular bone formation. To understand the underlying mechanism for ESET regulation of chondrocytes, we carried out co-expression experiments and found that ESET associates with histone deacetylase 4 to bind and inhibit the activity of Runx2, a hypertrophy-promoting transcription factor. Repression of Runx2-mediated gene transactivation by ESET is dependent on its H3-K9 methyltransferase activity as well as its associated histone deacetylase activity. In addition, knockout of ESET is associated with repression of Indian hedgehog gene in pre- and early hypertrophic chondrocytes. Together, these results provide clear evidence that ESET controls hypertrophic differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes and endochondral ossification during embryogenesis and postnatal development.

In most of the languages , people usually begin their conversations by a kind of small talk -a casual form of conversation that \\"breaks the ice\\" or fills an awkward silence between people . That is to say , small talk means the little things we talk about to start a conversation . In English-speaking countries such as Britain, people often make small talk about the weather. \\" Nice day, isn't it?\\" \\"Terrible weather , isn't it?\\" However, we still have something special about small talk.

She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.  Guess a valid title for it!

Symbiosis: A parasitic relationship is one in which one member of the association benefits while the other is harmed. This is also known as antagonistic or antipathetic symbiosis. Parasitic symbioses take many forms, from endoparasites that live within the host's body to ectoparasites that live on its surface. In addition, parasites may be necrotrophic, which is to say they kill their host, or biotrophic, meaning they rely on their host's surviving. Biotrophic parasitism is an extremely successful mode of life. Depending on the definition used, as many as half of all animals have at least one parasitic phase in their life cycles, and it is also frequent in plants and fungi. Moreover, almost all free-living animals are host to one or more parasite taxa. An example of a biotrophic relationship would be a tick feeding on the blood of its host.

HOHENWALD, Tennessee (CNN) -- A pair of African elephants tramps through lush vegetation, stopping to scoop dust with their trunks and toss it onto their backs for protection from the summer sun. Tarra, who was a year old when Buckley met her, was the inspiration for The Elephant Sanctuary. Meanwhile, two others submerge their massive forms to splash and dip in the waters of a muddy pond. It's a scene that could have been pulled from a nature documentary. But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee. It's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, OPTIONS: - Africa came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - Asia came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - CNN came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - Elephant Sanctuary came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - HOHENWALD came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - Tarra came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - Tennessee came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - The Elephant Sanctuary came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. - United States came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.","output":"Correct Answer:  - Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. Explanation: In the context of the story, Buckley is likely the trainer of the elephants. It would make sense that as the relationship between Buckley and the elephants strengthened, Buckley's perspective on elephant captivity would evolve. Thus, the option \\"Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant\\" is the correct answer. Other options mention geographical locations (Africa, Asia, HOHENWALD, Tennessee, United States), organizations (CNN, The Elephant Sanctuary) and an elephant (Tarra).

The answer is:","output":"Based on the available context, it is most likely that Taylor will want to comfort Ash after delivering the news or information that caused Ash to break down and cry bitterly. This response is due to Taylor's natural inclination to offer support and empathy to their friend during a difficult emotional moment. After witnessing Ash's emotional breakdown, Taylor's immediate instinct might be to provide comfort and consoling. This could mean offering a listening ear and gentle reassurances, or simply being present as a supportive friend. They may offer Ash a hug, hold their hand, or use physical touch to provide solace. Taylor might also express empathy towards Ash, acknowledging the depth of their emotions, and validating their feelings. During this interaction, some important strategies that Taylor could employ to effectively comfort Ash include: 1. Active listening: This means giving Ash the full attention, showing genuine concern, and nodding or maintaining eye contact to signify understanding and acknowledgement. 2. Offering reassurance: Gently reminding Ash that they are not alone in their struggle and that Taylor is there to support them can help alleviate some of Ash's immediate emotional distress. 3. Validating feelings: Instead of minimizing Ash's emotions, Taylor can validate their experience by acknowledging the pain they are going through and expressing understanding of their emotional response. 4. Offering help: Depending on Ash's specific needs, Taylor might suggest different forms of support, such as helping to solve the problem, providing advice, or directing them to professional help if necessary. Leaving the room or delivering bad news to Ash at this stage would likely exacerbate their emotional turmoil. Taylor's best response is to offer warmth, empathy, and kindness by comforting Ash in their time of need.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years, based on the context provided, is Friedrich. Caspar David Friedrich was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter who experienced a decline in popularity toward the end of his life, with his contemplative depictions of stillness falling out of step with the modernizing art world in Germany. Despite this, the early 20th century saw a renewal of appreciation for his work, underlining the cyclical nature of artistic tastes and reputations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: M'Liss is an innocent but rambunctious 17-year-old girl who was born and raised in the small town of Smith's Pocket. Her father Washoe Smith, whose briefly productive mining claim was both the source of the town's name and the reason for its existence, is now known among the people as the town drunk. M'Liss has to take care of him and works in a saloon washing glasses. They lose their home when Mayor Morpher demands it as the location of the new school. New school master Stephen Thorne encourages M'Liss to leave the saloon and go to school. Her father is shot and killed intervening in a saloon brawl. The now orphaned M'Liss is left in the guardianship of her father's friends, gambler Lou Ellis and the town barber Alf Edwards. When the mayor's wife Delia disapproves of M'Liss and tries to have her placed in an orphanage, M'Liss decides to leave Smith's Pocket. Stephen kisses M'Liss to persuade her not to run away. Told that a kiss is tantamount to a proposal of marriage, M'Liss is confused about what marriage is and asks for advice from heart-of-gold saloon girl Rose. The Morphers' ne'er-do-well city cousin, Jack Farlan, drunkenly tries to take advantage of M'Liss but is rescued by Stephen. When he refuses to duel Farlan with pistols, because he is a crack shot and would have the advantage over the intoxicated Farlan, Stephen is accused by the townspeople of cowardice. Late that night Farlan is shot and Stephen is accused, although in fact it is Lou who shot him. Assuming that Farlan will die, the town prepares to lynch Stephen, but Farlan will recover and Lou admits shooting him. Stephen proposes marriage to M'Liss and her guardians happily give their blessing.

Inspiring speakers charge thousands of dollars to give his kind of training to business managers and staff. It cost me only a12 taxi ride.  I had flown into Dallas just for the purpose of calling on a client. Time was important and my plan included a quick turn-around trip from and back to the airport. A clean taxi pulled up.  The driver rushed to open the passenger door for me and made sure I was comfortably seated before he closed the door. As he got in the driver's seat, he mentioned that the neatly folded Wall Street Journal next to me was for my use. He then showed me several tapes and asked me what type of music I would enjoy. Well! I looked around for a \\"Watching Camera!\\" Wouldn't you? I could not believe the service I was receiving! I took the opportunity to say, \\"Obviously you take great pride in your work.

The city has an estimated population of 274,400 as of 2016, or 70 percent of the entire population of the Bahamas. Lynden Pindling International Airport, the major airport for the Bahamas, is located about west of Nassau city centre, and has daily flights to major cities in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The city is located on the island of New Providence, which functions much like a business district. Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates. The city was named in honour of William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau.  - The Olympic Games (\\"Olympia\\", \\"the Olympics\\" also \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in 393 AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or \\"olympiad\\", which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.  - Dominic Demeritte ( born February 22 , 1978 in Nassau , Bahamas ) is a track and field sprinter who specializes in the 200 metres .  - The Bahamas, known officially as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, is an archipelagic state within the Lucayan Archipelago. It consists of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean and is located north of Cuba and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys. The state capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of \\"The Bahamas\\" can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses of ocean space.  - Cross country running is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass. Sometimes the runners are referred to as \\"harriers\\" (dogs). The course, typically long, may include surfaces of grass, and earth, pass through woodlands and open country, and include hills, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an individual and a team sport; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during autumn and winter, and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.  - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.  - New Providence is the most populous island in the Bahamas, containing more than 70% of the total population. It houses the national capital city of Nassau. The island was originally under Spanish control following Christopher Columbus's discovery of the New World, but the Spanish government showed little interest in developing the island (and the Bahamas as a whole). Nassau, the island's largest city, was formerly known as Charles-town, but it was burned to the ground by the Spanish in 1684. It was laid out and renamed Nassau in 1695 by Nicholas Trott, the most successful Lord Proprietor, in honor of the Prince of Orange-Nassau who became William III of England. The three branches of Bahamian Government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary, are all headquartered on New Providence. New Providence functions as the main commercial hub of the Bahamas. It is also home to more than 400 banks and trust companies, and its hotels and port account for more than two thirds of the four million-plus tourists who visit the Bahamas annually. Other settlements on New Providence include Grants Town, Bain Town, Fox Hill, Adelaide, Yamacraw, South Beach, Coral Harbour, Lyford Cay, Paradise Island, Sea Breeze, Centreville, The Grove (South) and The Grove (West Bay), Cable Beach, Delaporte, Gambier, and Love Beach.  - Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing. The name is derived from the sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.   - The 200 metres (also spelled 200 meters) is a sprint running event. On an outdoor 400 m track, the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight, so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race. A slightly shorter race, called the \\"stadion\\" and run on a straight track, was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games. The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes rely on different energy systems during the longer sprint.  - Lynden Pindling International Airport , formerly known as Nassau International Airport, is the largest airport in the Bahamas and the largest international gateway into the country.

Mike Rogers discuss violence against Americans in the Middle East This is a rush transcript from \\"Fox News Sunday,\\" September 16, 2012. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace. Violence against Americans sweeps the Middle East. WALLACE: We'll have the latest from the region and discuss what the Obama administration will do next with the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice. Then, big questions on Capitol Hill. Who is behind the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya? And should we cut off foreign protect our diplomats? We'll ask the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Mike Rogers. Plus, tough talk from both candidates on the Middle East. We'll ask our Sunday panel if foreign policy will finally become an issue in this campaign. And our Power Players of the Week, using their Washington clout to fight a devastating disease. All right now on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. We'll talk with Ambassador Rice and Chairman Rogers in a moment. But, first, here is the latest on the situation overseas. Protesters have attacked U.S. targets in more than 20 nations. Citing concerns over security, the State Department ordered all nonessential U.S. government personnel to leave Sudan and Tunisia. And in Benghazi, Libya, there are reports of more arrests in the attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. For more on the continuing unrest, let's bring in correspondent Leland Vittert, who is in Cairo, Egypt -- Leland. LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In cities across the Middle East, there is now a tense calm that has taken over here in Cairo. Hundreds if not thousands of riot police ready on standby in case violence breaks out, once again. For four days, it was a pitched fight between protesters on the street throwing Molotov cocktails and hurling rocks and then police firing back with rubber bullets and tear gas. The protesters carrying posters of Usama bin Laden and chanting, \\"Obama, Obama, we are all Usama.\\" In Tunis, Tunisia, U.S. citizens have been advised to evacuate the country and/or not travel to Tunisia after violence swept there that killed four people when protesters stormed the U.S. embassy. The government of Sudan, we're hearing, has denied entry to a Marine Special Operations team that was deemed sent to secure the U.S. embassy after a local sheikh called for mass protests in that country which resulted in thousands storming the embassy and security forces opening fire to try and push back the protesters. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has issued a communique urging more attacks. And here in Cairo, local media reports, there was a credible threat against the U.S. embassy here. Security is at an unprecedented level, with 15-foot tall concrete barriers erected on every one of the entranceways down to the U.S. embassy compound. We took a walk around earlier and outside the barricades, the protesters made their message clear, spray-painted in English \\"USA go to hell.\\" WALLACE: Leland Vittert reporting from Cairo -- Leland, thanks for that. Joining us now our ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice. Ambassador, welcome back to \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" AMB. SUSAN RICE, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Thank you. WALLACE: This week, there have been anti-American protests in two dozen countries across the Islamic world. The White House says it has nothing to do with the president's policies. JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is not a case of protests directed at the United States writ large or at U.S. policy. This is in response to a video that is offensive. WALLACE: You don't really believe that? RICE: Chris, absolutely I believe that. In fact, it is the case. We had the evolution of the Arab spring over the last many months. But what sparked the recent violence was the airing on the Internet of a very hateful very offensive video that has offended many people around the world. Now, our strong view is that there is no excuse for violence. It is absolutely reprehensible and never justified. But, in fact, there have been those in various parts of the world who have reacted with violence. Their governments have increasingly and effectively responded and protected our facilities and condemned the violence and this outrageous response to what is an offensive video. But there is no question that what we have seen in the past, with things like satanic verses, with the cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad, there have been -- such things that have sparked outrage and anger and this has been the proximate cause of what we've seen. WALLACE: Now, it may have sparked it but you critics say that the outpouring of outrage against the U.S. has everything to do with the U.S. policies, that we are disengaging from that part of the world, that we pulled out of Iraq, we are pulling out of Afghanistan, that Iran is continuing on with its nuclear program. And they say, our critics, that our allies no longer trust us, and our enemies no longer fear us. RICE: Well, Chris, that's just false. And let's be plain -- our partners and allies have responded effectively and promptly when we have asked them to protect our facilities and our people. WALLACE: Well, let's -- it took three days in Cairo. RICE: Well -- and what happened initially in Cairo was not sufficiently robust when President Obama picked up the phone and spoke to the President Morsi, right away things changed. And that's an evidence of our influence and our impact. And what happened was that the authorities in Egypt have been very robust in protecting our facilities, not just in Cairo, but elsewhere in the country. President Morsi has issued repeated condemnations of the violent response and called for calm. And we have seen the same thing in Yemen, in Libya, in Tunisia and many other parts of the world. WALLACE: Why are we asking all nongovernmental personnel to leave Sudan and Tunisia? What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the violence against Americans in the Middle East, countermeasures taken by the U.S. government, the discussions with key officials, and the potential impact on political campaigns. 1. Violence against Americans has swept the Middle East, with protesters attacking U.S. targets in over 20 nations. This violence has led to the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. 2. In response to security concerns, the State Department ordered all non-essential U.S. government personnel to leave Sudan and Tunisia.

Europe is a world leader in ecoefficient technologies Add punctuation.","output":"Europe is a world leader in eco-efficient technologies. Europe, as a continent, has consistently been at the forefront of implementing and promoting eco-efficient technologies. This commitment has undoubtedly contributed to its reputation as a global leader in the ongoing battle against climate change and environmental degradation. Eco-efficient technologies aim to reduce both the consumption of natural resources and the generation of waste, while maintaining economic growth and enhancing the overall quality of life for citizens. Europe has long recognized the significance of these technologies, and has adopted a variety of policies and strategies to encourage their widespread use. For example, the European Union (EU) has established ambitious goals related to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and emissions reductions. These targets not only drive innovation within the European market, but also set a precedent for other countries to follow. In the realm of renewable energy, European countries lead the charge in adopting solar, wind, and bioenergy technologies. Germany, for instance, is the global leader in installed solar capacity, while Denmark and Sweden derive a majority of their electricity from wind power. Additionally, countries like Finland and Austria are delivering innovative solutions in the field of bioenergy, supporting the sustainable use of biomass for power generation. European companies are also pioneering eco-efficient products and services. An example of this can be found in electric vehicles (EVs), where companies like BMW, Volkswagen, and Renault are amongst the world leaders in EV manufacturing and adoption. In the same vein, many European cities have deployed extensive charging infrastructure and established supportive policies to encourage EV use. Moreover, Europe has made significant strides in energy-efficient building design, setting high environmental standards for new construction through the imposition of green building codes. Cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam exemplify this commitment, with a multitude of energy-efficient buildings and the promotion of low-impact living. Finally, Europe has a central role in international efforts to promote eco-efficient technologies on a global scale. It does this through international agreements like the Paris Agreement, by championing climate change initiatives, and by exporting greener technologies to developing countries. This leadership extends to funding sustainability research, with European institutions consistently leading such projects. In conclusion, Europe's position as a world leader in eco-efficient technologies is evident in its adoption of renewable energy sources, green transport solutions, sustainable building design, and global climate change policies. European countries have demonstrated a continuous commitment to fostering innovation and meeting high environmental standards, setting the stage for a more sustainable future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.  Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of phosphates?  Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).","output":"Based on the information provided and the hint, Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production that potentially reduced leaching of phosphates.

Látka je schopna proniknout do tkání, orgánů a tělních tekutin, což zajišťuje jeho přítomnost v místech, kde je potřebná pro boj proti infekčním agens. Kromě toho je ceftriaxon schopen překlenout placentární bariéru, což je vrstva buněk oddělující krev matky a krev plodu. Tato vlastnost umožňuje antibiotikum proniknout do placentárního oběhu a poskytnout ochranu proti infekcím i v případě těhotných žen. To je důležité, protože některé bakteriální infekce mohou způsobit potíže jak matce, tak plodu, což může vést ke komplikacím v průběhu těhotenství, porodu nebo při péči o novorozence.

Question 1: Do you need to remap ECU after installing K&N air filter in Royal Enfield Classic 500 EFI? Question 2: Is it safe to change the air filter and exhaust on a fuel injected Royal Enfield without remapping the ECU? If so , what are the safest options? Available choices: [-] no [-] yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Wow, those are wonderful questions! So, let's learn a bit. 1. When you put a new K&N air filter into your Royal Enfield Classic 500 EFI, you don't actually have to remap your ECU. This is because the air filter change only improves the quality of the air coming into your engine, but it doesn't change the amount of fuel going in. So, the ECU, which is like the brain that controls how your engine works, doesn't need to think differently or be reprogrammed. 2. Now, when you want to change the air filter and the exhaust, it could be a bit different. See, an exhaust change can cause more air to flow out of your engine faster. This might mean your engine needs more fuel to balance out all the extra air. If you don't adjust or remap the ECU, it might not supply enough fuel and your engine might not run smoothly or could potentially damage over time. So, it's generally safer to remap the ECU when changing both the air filter and exhaust. So, in simple terms, for just changing the air filter, the answer would be 'no'. But for changing both the air filter and the exhaust, the answer is likely 'yes'. Hence, the answer to these two questions wouldn't be the same."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Vampires The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Crimson Dawn\\" Genre: Action, War, Horror Plot Summary: In the heart of the American Civil War, a group of courageous Union soldiers stumbles upon a dark secret - an army of bloodthirsty vampires that threatens to shift the balance of power and bring darkness upon the nation. Together with a team of vampire hunters, they must race against time to destroy their unholy foe and bring a new dawn to a divided land. Plot: It's 1863, and the merciless tide of the American Civil War rages on. Young Union soldier, Benjamin Carter, and his comrades find themselves in the depths of the southern states, facing horrific violence on the battlefield. Little do they know, a far more sinister enemy lies in the shadows. Upon the discovery of an abandoned and eerily deserted village, Benjamin and his fellow soldiers soon learn of the atrocities committed there. A wicked force has been preying on innocent souls - a legion of vampires led by the callous and calculating Confederate General, Jonathan Ambrose. As fear and paranoia spread through the ranks, so does the realization that these bloodsucking beasts have infiltrated every level of the Confederate army. With Ambrose pulling the strings for ultimate control over the United States, these creatures of the night threaten to not only alter the fate of the war but plunge the whole nation into darkness. In a desperate attempt to save their country, Benjamin and the remaining survivors of his unit join forces with an elite team of vampire hunters, including the enigmatic and battle-hardened Ezekiel Cross. Together, they must battle untold horrors and navigate treacherous territory to uncover the vampires' master plan and put an end to their reign of terror. As they journey deeper into enemy territory, the alliance between humans and their monstrous enemies will be tested like never before. In this war of both flesh and fangs, sacrifices must be made if there is any hope for a brighter future. In a climactic battle, Benjamin and his allies face off against General Ambrose and the vampire horde in the heart of their lair. As friends fall and the odds seem insurmountable, Benjamin must confront his fears and find the strength to defeat the encroaching darkness. Utilizing a secret weapon crafted by the vampire hunters, he destroys Ambrose, sparking disarray among the vampire ranks, and ultimately leading to their defeat. With the tide of the Civil War turning, and the vampire threat vanquished, Benjamin looks forward to a brighter future. Though victory was won at a tremendous cost, the scarred nation starts to heal and unity begins to emerge on the horizon, like a Crimson Dawn."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Many of the underlying causes of incontinence unfortunately cannot be controlled. Benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurological disorders, stroke, prostate/bladder cancer, etc. cannot be prevented. However, you can take steps to minimize your risk of some of these underlying conditions. . One excellent way to reduce your risk of developing incontinence is to stop smoking. The National Institutes of health reports that up to 50% of bladder cancer cases are caused by smoking. Pressure in the bladder caused by tumors results in incontinence. If you need help quitting, schedule an appointment with your doctor, who can help you quit. There are prescribed medications to help you, and she can also help you find a local support group. . When you are overweight, extra pressure gets placed on your bladder. This extra pressure on your bladder can lead to incontinence. While losing weight may seem like a daunting task, it will be well worth it in the end. Start exercising more and make an effort to eat healthy foods. Other ways you can lose weight include:  Making sure that you get the right amount of protein, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and healthy carbohydrates each day. Your daily intake of each food group will depend on your weight, age, and health. If you should be consuming 2,000 calories a day, you should eat six to eight servings of grains, four to five servings of veggies, four to five servings of fruit, 3 – 6 ounces of protein, two to three servings of low-fat dairy, and two to three servings of fats and oils.  Developing an exercise routine and sticking to it. Your exercise routine should include cardiovascular training (like running or swimming), weight training (like doing push-ups or lifting weights), and flexibility training (like yoga or stretching). Limiting the portions of each meal you have. Choosing low-calorie snacks like fruits and vegetables. Research has indicated that men with prostate cancer had 62 – 75% decreased zinc in malignant prostate cells and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy. The recommendation is for zinc supplementation, but amounts are not clear at present. Consult your doctor regarding a healthy amount of zinc supplementation based on the present zinc levels in your diet. Lycopenes are powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants shown to fight cancer. Five of the foods highest in lycopenes  per cup include:  Guava: 8587 uq Watermelon: 6889 uq Tomatoes: 7298 uq Papaya:  2651 uq Grapefruit: 2611uq Some recent findings have suggested that the isoflavones in soy may help prevent prostate cancer. You can increase the amount of soy in your diet with edamame, soy milk, or tofu. Omega-3 fatty acids are present in a wide array of fish and seafood options, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, and bass. Studies have shown that omega-3's protect against cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. Drink at least eight glasses of water during the day to prevent conditions such as urinary tract infection, constipation, and kidney stones that cause incontinence. You should also consider drinking most of your fluids during the day and limiting the amount of fluids you drink in the evening before going to bed. If you are afraid that you may develop incontinence, you can train your bladder to some degree. Plan particular times during the day to visit the restroom. This is a way to train your bladder, which helps to avoid incontinence. Substances that can lead to incontinence include alcohol, caffeine, acidic foods, spicy foods, and sugar or artificial sweetener.  Alcohol is a diuretic, an agent that causes your body to lose fluid. It also irritates the bladder, causing incontinence. Try to limit your alcohol intake to one glass per night if at all. Caffeine is also a diuretic. Drink caffeinated beverages early in the day if at all. Kegel exercises are a great way to prevent incontinence because they strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. Learning how to do them correctly can be a little tricky because you have to isolate your pelvic muscles. Your pelvic muscles are the muscles you use when you try to stop urinating midstream. You will see or feel your testicles rising when you squeeze your pelvic muscles. Once you’ve isolated your pelvic muscles, squeeze them and hold for a count of five and then relax for a count of five. Your goal is to do ten repetitions, three times a day. A diuretic is a medication that gets rid of extra fluid in the body. This is usually prescribed for patients who have heart conditions. Sadly, it also has a tendency to cause incontinence. There are several different kinds of diuretics: thiazide, loop, potassium-sparing, and quinazoline diuretics. Recognizable diuretic medications include:  Thiazide diuretics: Clorpres, Tenoretic, Thalitone, Capozide, Dyazide, Hyzaar, Lopressor HCT, Maxzide, and Prinzide. Loop diuretics: Lasix and Demadex. Potassium-sparing diuretics: Aldactazide, Aldactone, Dyazide, and Maxzide. Quinazoline diuretics: Zaroxolyn Always consult your doctor before taking yourself off a prescribed medication. A muscle relaxant is a medication prescribed for certain types of injuries to muscles. It may not come as too much of a surprise that the medications that relax your body also cause incontinence. Recognizable muscle relaxants include:  Valium, Soma, Flexeril, Skelaxin, and Robaxin. Sedatives can also cause incontinence. An antihypertensive drug is a medication used to lower blood pressure. Antihypertensive drugs can be a combination of different kinds of diuretics. If you are using an antihypertensive drug, ask your doctor about other medications available that do not list incontinence as a side effect. Recognizable antihypertensive drugs include: Moduretic, Minizide, Monopril HCT, and Accuretic. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article outlines various factors contributing to incontinence and provides steps to minimize risk and manage the condition. Some factors like benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurological disorders, and cancer cannot be prevented; however, lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing incontinence.

Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 - February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. Rogers was famous for creating, hosting and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968-2001), which featured his kind-hearted grandfatherly personality, and direct connection to his audiences. Originally trained and ordained as a minister, Rogers was displeased with the way television addressed children at the time, and made an effort to change this when he began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. Rogers developed his own show on WQED in 1968, and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. During the controversy surrounding the introduction of the household VCR, Rogers was involved in supporting the manufacturers of VCRs in court. His 1979 testimony, in the case Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., noted that he did not object to home recordings of his television programs, for instance, by families in order to watch them together at a later time. This testimony contrasted with the views of others in the television industry who objected to home recordings or believed that devices to facilitate it should be taxed or regulated.  When the case reached the Supreme Court in 1983, the majority decision considered the testimony of Rogers when it held that the Betamax video recorder did not infringe copyright. The Court stated that his views were a notable piece of evidence \\"that many [television] producers are willing to allow private time-shifting to continue\\" and even quoted his testimony in a footnote:  Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the Neighborhood at hours when some children cannot use it ... I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows people to tape the Neighborhood off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the Neighborhood because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been \\"You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions.\\" Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.

His sister thought it was funny so she recorded it and posted the video online. The video -- and Sam -- became a hit. Only 8 years old at the time, he couldn't have expected the response. \\"(The television show) The Doctors called and wanted me on their show so they paid for me to go to California,\\" says Sam, now 13, \\"and we got to stay in a hotel where all the movie stars stayed.\\" During that visit to California, Angie Allred, Sam's mother, had an idea about Sam writing a children's book. Together, she and Sam wrote Opening Hearts, which tells Sam's experience of living with a chronic illness. \\"I wrote the book to teach people to be kinder to people,\\" Sam says. Moreover, Sam wanted to send pillows to sick children staying in hospitals around the country to make their stay more comfortable, an idea that came from a time when he was in the hospital. \\"A few kind boys came in with pillows and they gave me one and it meant a lot to me that someone cared about kids in the hospital,\\" says Sam. Angie thought of starting a nonprofit organization to provide a way for people to contribute money to realize Sam's ideas. She named the nonprofit Kindness for Kids. Since then, Sam has taken pillows to children staying at Providence Hospital in Anchorage. Sam's father, Scott Allred, owns a small business that contracts shipping services with FedEx Ground.

Lieutenant Commander Ken White orders the submarine Tiger Shark to dive to evade an aerial and surface attack. Crewman Boyer begs him to wait for the captain, Commander Josh Rice, still topside, but White refuses, and Rice (his good friend) and the quartermaster are lost. When they resurface shortly afterward, they discover that the war is over. No one other than Boyer, not even the captain's widow and father, blames him. White marries Carol and remains in the Navy after the war. Everything is fine, until one day he is assigned to show a reporter around who is doing a story about the mothballed Navy. By chance, the submarine that catches the journalist's attention is the Tiger Shark. The newsman remembers the tragic story of the last day of the war and mentions that the officer who ordered the dive \\"must feel like a heel\\", and White's feelings of guilt resurface, straining his marriage. Then Boyer is assigned to his unit. When Boyer sees White, he immediately requests a transfer. As it happens, the Tiger Shark is being recommissioned, so White sends him there. A fire breaks out on the submarine, trapping a man in a compartment. Boyer wants to charge in to his rescue, but White makes him go \\"by the book\\" and put on a protective suit first, fueling Boyer's hatred. White is about to resign from the Navy to escape the ghosts of his past, but changes his mind at the last moment. As a result, Carol decides to leave him.

As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico is governed by the U.S. Congress, and the island has a non-voting representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. However, due to its territorial status, Puerto Rico does not have voting representation in the U.S. Senate, nor do its residents vote for President of the United States. Even though it is an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico is officially known as the \\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\\" which means it has a certain degree of self-governance, similar to a U.S. state. The island's government structure parallels that of the United States, with a governor as the chief executive, a bicameral legislature composed of a Senate and House of Representatives, and a judiciary. Nonetheless, its residents are subject to federal laws and U.S. Constitution provisions that apply to unincorporated territories. As U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans are afforded many of the same benefits and services, such as Social Security and Medicare. However, Puerto Rico does not have the same representation in the U.S. federal government that states do, and it does not get the same level of federal funding. Some aspects of Puerto Rico's unique relationship with the United States are still contested and debated, including its political status, economic sustainability, and the possibility of eventually becoming a U.S. state or an independent country. In summary, based on the provided text, Puerto Rico is part of the United States as an unincorporated territory, and its residents are U.S. citizens. However, Puerto Rico's political status sets it apart from fully incorporated U.S. states."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that the widowed father shows concern for? ?  Tony Rivers, a troubled teenager at Rockdale High, is known for losing his temper and overreacting. A campus fight between Tony and classmate Jimmy gets the attention of the local police, Det. Donovan in particular. Donovan breaks up the fight and advises Tony to talk with a \\"psychologist\\" that works at the local aircraft plant, Dr. Alfred Brandon, a practitioner of hypnotherapy. Tony declines, but his girlfriend Arlene, as well as his widowed father, show concern about his violent behavior. Later, at a Halloween party at the \\"haunted house\\", an old house at which several of the teenagers hang out, Tony attacks his friend Vic after being surprised from behind. After seeing the shocked expressions on his friends's faces, he realizes he needs help and goes to see Dr. Brandon. On Tony's first visit, however, Brandon makes it clear that he has his own agenda while the teenager lies on the psychiatrist's couch: Tony will be an excellent subject for his experiments with a scopolamine serum he has developed that regresses personalities to their primitive instincts. Brandon believes that the only future that mankind has is to \\"hurl him back to his primitive state.\\" Although Brandon's assistant, Dr. Hugo Wagner, protests that the experiment might kill Tony, Brandon continues and within two sessions suggests to Tony that he was once a wild animal.
