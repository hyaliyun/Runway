It was different from the ones Eda had shown her; it shimmered with a multicolored light that seemed to beckon her closer. As she reached out tentatively, a sudden surge of energy pulled her through. Unbeknownst to her, in another realm, a similar event had occurred with a young Chaotic player named Tom Majors, known in the game as MajorTom. He had been exploring an uncharted location within Perim when a strange portal appeared, sucking him in. **Chapter 2: Collision of Worlds** Luz and Tom tumbled out of the portal into a forest that was a blend of their worlds. The trees bore the twisted shapes of the Boiling Isles, while the ground was littered with the digital codes characteristic of Chaotic. They got to their feet, staring at each other in disbelief. \\"Where...what...who are you?\\" they both uttered simultaneously. Before they could further question their situation, the ground shook as a shrieking beast, half Orthrus from The Owl House and half Smildon from Chaotic, charged at them. Acting on instinct, Tom tapped into his Chaotic knowledge, and to his surprise, he found he could morph into Tangath Toborn, his favorite OverWorld character. Luz, not to be outdone, wielded her staff, readying a spell. Together, they subdued the creature, marveling at their teamwork. Realization dawned on them; they were stuck in a world that was a chaotic amalgamation of their realms. **Chapter 3: The Quest for Answers** Determined to find a way back to their respective worlds, Luz and Tom ventured deeper into the forest. The landscape fluctuated, now a dense jungle from Perim, now the eerie terrain of the Boiling Isles. Their journey led them to a clearing where a figure awaited, a fusion of Eda the Owl Lady and Chaor, the powerful leader of the UnderWorld creatures. This entity, who introduced itself as Edaor, explained that their worlds had collided due to a rip in the multiverse fabric, caused by an experiment gone wrong. \\"The only way to restore balance and return to your homes,\\" Edaor explained, \\"is to find the Heart of the Rift, a powerful artifact that can mend the tear between worlds.\\" **Chapter 4: United We Stand** Realizing the gravity of their quest, Luz and Tom gathered allies from both worlds, who had also been caught in the cross-dimensional chaos. Among them were Amity Blight, wielding her magic with precision, and Maxxor, leader of the OverWorld, embodying strength and courage. Their journey was fraught with challenges, as they battled hybrid creatures and navigated treacherous landscapes. Along the way, Luz and Tom learned from each other; Luz shared her knowledge of glyphs and witchcraft, while Tom taught her the strategic tactics of Chaotic battles. **Chapter 5: The Heart of the Rift** Finally, after a grueling journey, the group reached the location of the Heart of the Rift, guarded by a fearsome creature, a blend of The Owl House's Emperor Belos and Chaotic's Lord Van Bloot. The battle was fierce, testing the limits of their powers and their resolve. In a moment of desperation, Luz and Tom combined their energies, Luz channeling her spells through Tom's Chaotic morph. The fusion of magic and digital power was enough to defeat the guardian, securing the Heart of the Rift. With the artifact in hand, they repaired the tear in the fabric of the universe. A blinding light enveloped them, and when it faded, they found themselves back in their respective worlds. **Chapter 6: A Farewell Across Worlds** Luz stood in front of the portal, the memory of her adventure fresh in her mind. She had a feeling that this wouldn't be the last time their paths would cross. Back in Chaotic, Tom looked at the now inactive portal and smiled. Even though they were worlds apart, their unlikely friendship had changed them forever. With a newfound respect for magic and a deep understanding of the importance of unity, they both knew that no matter the challenges, they would always have an ally in an alternate universe. **The End.** And thus concludes the tale of Luz and Tom, a testament to the power of friendship that transcends worlds, and a reminder that sometimes chaos can lead to the most extraordinary adventures."},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Я играл в геополитическую игру. Оцени правление моего персонажа, определи его идеологию. Вот запись игры: Давай поиграем в симулятор Геополитики. Я хочу отыграть за Беларуси. Мой персонаж: Анна Виноградова. Указывай мне дату и одно событие, которое нужно мне решить сейчас. -- Дата: 12 марта 2023 года.

Меня интересует, что подаётся на вход и как, а также дальнейшие преобразования","output":"Обучение сети типа Трансформер, впервые представленной в статье \\"Attention Is All You Need\\" Vaswani et al. (2017), включает в себя несколько ключевых компонент и процессов, в том числе внимание, кодирование позиций, слои самовнимания, и, как правило, обучение на основе пар предложений (например, исходный текст и его перевод). Давайте рассмотрим основные шаги обучения сети Типа Трансформер: # 1. Подготовка данных **На вход** подаются пары \\"вопрос-ответ\\", \\"исходный текст-перевод\\" или любые другие пары сегментов текста. Сначала данные предобрабатываются: текст разбивается на токены (слова, символы или подслова), которые затем преобразуются в уникальные числовые идентификаторы (индексы в словаре). Для каждого токена также генерируется вектор позиции, который помогает модели учитывать порядок слов в предложении. # 2. Встраивание (Embedding) Токены и позиции преобразуются в плотные векторы с помощью слоев встраивания. При этом слой встраивания для позиций призван добавить информацию о порядке следования токенов, так как сама архитектура трансформера не имеет встроенного понимания порядка следования элементов последовательности. # 3. Блоки самовнимания (Self-Attention) и Фидфорвардные слои Суть процесса обучения в трансформерах заключается в последовательном применении блоков самовнимания и фидфорвардных слоев. В блоках самовнимания каждый токен \\"внимает\\" всем остальным токенам в предложении, что позволяет модели уловить контекст каждого слова. После слоев внимания следуют фидфорвардные слои, состоящие из полносвязных нейронных сетей, которые обрабатывают каждый токен независимо от других. # 4. Нормализация, Dropout и Residual Connection После каждого блока самовнимания и после каждого фидфорвардного слоя добавляется нормализация слоев (LayerNorm), а также может использоваться Dropout для предотвращения переобучения. Также используются остаточные соединения (Residual Connections), которые помогают избежать проблемы исчезающего градиента в глубоких сетях. # 5. Декодер В архитектуре трансформера декодер работает похожим образом, однако он учитывает не только выходы кодера, но и уже сгенерированные токены, что позволяет модели пошагово генерировать выходные последовательности. # 6. Выход На выходном слое используется функция активации, например, Softmax, для предсказания следующего токена в последовательности. Модель обучается с использованием функции потерь, как правило, это кросс-энтропия, которая минимизирует расхождение между выходом модели и истинными метками (например, следующими токенами в тексте). # Обучение Обучение трансформера, как и большинства нейронных сетей, производится с помощью обратного распространения ошибки (backpropagation) и оптимизации параметров сети (весов), обычно с использованием алгоритмов типа Adam или SGD для минимизации функции потерь. Трансформеры крайне эффективны в задачах обработки естественного языка благодаря своей способности улавливать сложные зависимости в данных, что делает их популярным выбором для перевода текста, генерации текста, классификации текстов и других задач NLP."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman hanging out.

The water calls, and I dare say we've both earned a moment's peace.\\" Beregond, hesitant at first, soon found the prospect of cool water against his skin too enticing to resist. They approached the hidden pond, shedding their armors and garments, revealing physiques sculpted by years of training and battle. Beregond's form was robust, a testament to the rigorous discipline of the Gondorian forces, his skin kissed by the sun only where his armor allowed. His hair, dark as raven's wings, lay flat against his head, a stark contrast to the unruliness of the Rohirric winds that played with Eadmund's locks, golden and untamed. As they compared their butts, a moment of hearty laughter rang through the air - Beregond's was as firm as the sturdy walls of Minas Tirith, while Eadmund's carried the strength and curve of the rolling hills of Rohan. As they entered the pond, the water welcomed them, cool whispers against their heated skin. Eadmund, ever the jester, splashed water towards Beregond, who retaliated in kind until both were submerged in laughter and the woes of the world seemed distant memories. \\"Stand still, friend,\\" Eadmund said amidst chuckles, \\"You've more knots in your back than a Gondorian treaty. Let me help.\\" And so, he began washing Beregond's back, hands firm yet gentle, ensuring no spot was missed - not even the curves of Beregond’s resilient rear, which received a snort of laughter from Eadmund as he worked. \\"You're as tense back here as a council meeting!\\" Amidst their camaraderie, Eadmund's stomach let out a rumble more fearsome than a charging Rohirric steed. \\"Starved, I am! How say you to a bite?\\" Beregond, puzzled yet intrigued, nodded. With a mischievous grin, Eadmund announced his plan to catch their meal in a manner most unconventional. Positioning himself squarely in the pond, a look of focused anticipation painted across his face, Eadmund let out a fart of such monumental proportions that it seemed the very leaves on the trees shook in disbelief. Beregond watched, wide-eyed, as fish began to float to the surface - victims of the Rohirric method of fishing. The relief on Eadmund's face was palpable, his grin as wide as the Anduin. \\"There's your supper, Beregond! Let no one say Eadmund of Rohan doesn't provide for his friends.\\" Collecting the fish in a fit of laughter and disbelief, they prepared a fire by the pond's edge, roasting their catch and letting the warmth seep back into their bones. Beregond, shaking his head in amazement, couldn't help but say, \\"I've fought orcs less fearsome than your... methods, Eadmund.\\" Eadmund simply laughed, the firelight dancing in his eyes. \\"Mayhaps, but orc-fighting won’t fill your belly as well. Eat up, my friend, for tomorrow we ride, and tonight we feast on the spoils of war - and gas.\\" As the night drew on, their laughter mingled with the crackling of the fire, a simple moment of joy and relief amidst the turmoil of their world. In that hidden pond under the stars, a Gondorian and a Rohirric horseman found solace in friendship, and a story utterly ridiculous to share—or perhaps wisely keep to themselves."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo about why the Kangurola playgroup in Fuengirola has closed, a user says \\"Since they have Disney characters on their windows I'd assume the mouse handed them a hefty lawsuit\\"","output":"SunshineMama34: Hey everyone, has anyone heard about why Kangurola Playgroup in Fuengirola closed down? My kids loved that place, and it seemed pretty sudden. TechieDad21: I was wondering the same thing. It was a hit with the little ones. Last I heard, they were doing quite well, especially during the holiday seasons. LovingGran: Oh, my grandchildren are going to be so disappointed. They had their hearts set on celebrating a birthday there next month. BeachLife87: Since they have Disney characters on their windows, I'd assume the mouse handed them a hefty lawsuit. Disney is known to be pretty protective of its intellectual properties. FuengiMum: That's an interesting theory, @BeachLife87. But, wouldn't they have removed those images if that was an issue? Plus, I haven't seen any news about a lawsuit or anything. ExpatisLife: @FuengiMum makes a valid point. These things usually make the local news, especially if it involves a big name like Disney coming down on a local business. EcoWarriorSpain: It’s a shame, really. Irrespective of the reason, it’s the kids and the community that lose out when family-oriented places shut down. LegalEagle101: From a legal standpoint, @BeachLife87's suggestion might have some merit, but without concrete evidence, it’s purely speculative. Disney indeed vigorously protects its copyrights, but they usually send cease and desist letters before taking any drastic legal actions that lead to closures. DigitalNomadGary: A friend of mine who worked there mentioned something about the lease not being renewed, combined with some internal management issues. Though, that's secondhand info, so take it with a grain of salt. CommunityHelper: I propose we organize some kind of support or fundraiser for the owners if they are indeed facing legal issues or any other troubles. It was a place that brought a lot of joy to our kids, after all. SunshineMama34: That’s a great idea, @CommunityHelper. Whether it was a legal matter or something else, losing Kangurola is a big blow to our community. ArtisticSoul: In the meantime, does anyone know of any similar child-friendly playgroups or activities in the area? My little ones are asking for an alternative. FuengiMum: Yes, let's keep the spirit of community support strong! Also, @ArtisticSoul, there’s a new arts and crafts center that opened last month. It could be a nice alternative. I’ll send you the details. BeachLife87: Reflecting on what everyone’s said, jumping to conclusions about legal issues might have been premature. It’s sad to see Kangurola go, but I appreciate how everyone’s coming together to support each other and find alternatives."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman hanging out.

Both have faced the shadows of Mordor together, but on this day, they were in search of peace, laughter, and perhaps a bit of whimsy. \\"Andil, my friend,\\" Eadric began, patting his comrade's back as they trekked through the woodland, \\"the weight of the world seems to rest upon your shoulders. What say you we find a spot to relax? Perhaps, a bit of… skinnydipping?\\" Andil raised an eyebrow but couldn't hide a smile. \\"A Rohirric remedy for melancholy, I presume?\\" \\"Indeed!\\" Eadric exclaimed. \\"A plunge into the unknown to wash away our woes.\\" Their laughter echoed through the woods as they found a secluded pond, shimmering under the afternoon sun. The two friends disrobed, their warrior's physiques a testament to the life they've led. Andil's frame was lean and defined, the kind that spoke of agility and decades of training with sword and bow. Eadric, in contrast, boasted broader shoulders and robust muscles shaped by years of horseback combat and contests of strength. Their hair, too, told tales of their people; Andil's was short and well-kept, typical of the disciplined Gondorians, while Eadric's long locks flowed with the wild freedom of the Rohirric steppes. As they stepped into the pond, the cool water embraced them, drawing forth peals of laughter and shared jokes. Eadric, always the more audacious of the two, began washing Andil's back, a show of camaraderie among soldiers. \\"You've been carrying too much these days, friend. Let the waters ease your burdens.\\" Andil chuckled, fully immersed in the ridiculousness of the situation. \\"Eadric, I fear if I relax any further, I shall become one with the pond.\\" Suddenly, with mischief sparkling in his eyes, Eadric asked, \\"Hungry, are you? Fancy a bit of a feast?\\" \\"Unless you've packed a meal, I fear we'll be dining on leaves and berries,\\" Andil replied, skepticism lacing his voice. Eadric grinned. \\"Behold, the Rohirric method of fishing!\\" With that, he positioned himself in the water and, with a dramatic flourish that only Eadric could muster, let out a pungent fart, the likes of which echoed against the trees, startling birds into flight. Eadric's face shifted from effort to relief as he laughed heartily, the absurdity of the act magnified by his pride in the unconventional technique. As the ripples subsided, several fish floated to the surface, victims of Eadric's unconventional weapon. The two friends couldn't contain their mirth, falling into the water, laughing until their sides ached. Gathering the fish, they lit a fire, and as it crackled and danced, they roasted their catch, the woodsy aroma filling the air. \\"This, Andil, is the taste of victory,\\" Eadric declared, offering a perfectly cooked fish to his friend. \\"Ah, Eadric, only you would consider flatulence a battle tactic. Yet, I must admit, I haven't felt this light-hearted in ages,\\" Andil conceded, biting into the fish with gusto. As the fire dwindled to embers, the two friends sat beside it, their spirits renewed by the day's escapades. Their laughter and the warmth of the fire held the night's chill at bay, a testament to the enduring power of friendship and the odd yet undeniable magic of a good laugh. \\"Tomorrow, we face the world anew,\\" Andil mused, gazing at the stars. \\"Aye, but tonight, we feast and make merry, for who knows what the morrow brings,\\" Eadric replied, his voice filled with warmth and gratitude. In the heart of Middle-earth, beneath the vast canopy of stars, two friends from distant lands shared a moment of absurdity and joy, a reminder that amidst the darkest times, light—and laughter—could always be found."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman hanging out.

Y tal vez, la última de esas veces fue la más determinante para dejar todo atrás. No fue sencillo, pero era necesario. Recuerdo el día en que tomé la decisión, una que cambiaría mi vida para siempre. La Bati-familia, mi familia, ya no sentía como tal. Bruce, con su obstinado código de moral, permitía una y otra vez que Joker, entre otros, caminaran en un círculo infinito de captura, escape y terror. La gota que derramó el vaso fue cuando Joker vino a mi casa, y con una bala cambió mi vida, me dejó en esta silla de ruedas y torturó a mi padre. Bruce solo lo devolvió a Arkham, como siempre. Y ahí, en la profundidad de mi desesperación, supe que tenía que irme. Entonces llegué a National City, buscando un nuevo comienzo lejos de la sombra de Gotham. Encontrar empleo en CatCo fue el primer paso, y conocer a Kara y Winn fue como abrir la ventana a una nueva esperanza. Mi mejor amiga, Dina, me siguió en esta nueva aventura. Juntas, intentábamos rehacer nuestras vidas, apoyándonos la una a la otra mientras explorábamos esta nueva ciudad que nos cobijaba. Pero entonces, apareció Gonzalo. Dina fue la primera en notar su presencia, hablando de él con esa chispa de entusiasmo en sus ojos. Al principio, no le di mucha importancia, concentrada en mi propia recuperación y adaptación. Sin embargo, el destino parecía tener otros planes. Gonzalo encontró su camino hasta mí, primero en la biblioteca donde tomaba turnos. Su presencia era magnética, y aún cuando traté de mantenerme al margen, algo sobre él me atrapó. La curiosidad por Gonzalo se volvió mutua, y compartimos algunos momentos juntos que me hicieron reconsiderar mi inicial desinterés. A pesar de mi situación, él me trató con una normalidad que rozaba lo extraordinario. Pero la tranquilidad es efímera, especialmente para aquellos que, como yo, vienen de un pasado lleno de sombras. El ataque de los drones fue tan inesperado como aterrador. Allí estaba, incapaz de defenderme, de proteger a Gonzalo, esperando lo peor. Pero en esos momentos de desesperanza, vi algo increíble; Gonzalo detuvo las balas en el aire. Sus ojos, aquel poder que emanaba... todo en él me gritaba que había mucho más de lo que podía entender. Después de ese incidente, con la realidad alterada y mi mente luchando por asimilar lo sucedido, solo pude formular una pregunta: \\"¿Qué eres?\\" Esta pregunta no solo buscaba entender a la persona que había barrido todas mis certezas en un instante, sino que también me enfrentaba a la realidad de que, quizás, mi pasado y mi lucha contra lo extraordinario no estaban tan lejos de mí como creía. Lo que Gonzalo era, y lo que eso significaba para mi vida, era algo que estaba por descubrir."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman hanging out.

How about I provide a comedic tale of the two friends in a more appropriate manner? Let's keep the setting and characters but alter the plot slightly. --- In the sprawling, golden plains of Rohan, under the ever-watchful eye of the White Mountains, a Gondorian soldier named Amdir and a Rohirric horseman named Eothain found themselves resting. Their friendship, forged in the fires of battle and cooled in the quieter moments of peace, was the kind that could only exist in Middle-Earth, where the mighty and the humble stood side by side. \\"Lighten your heart, Amdir,\\" Eothain chuckled, seeing his friend's brow furrowed with the weight of the world, or perhaps just the weight of his armor. \\"I have an idea that'll sweep those furrows from your brow as easily as the wind sweeps the plains.\\" Intrigued and somewhat amused, Amdir followed his friend through a copse of trees until they stumbled upon a secluded pond, its waters clear and inviting. \\"Are you thinking what I believe you are thinking?\\" Amdir asked with a raised eyebrow. \\"Worry not, friend. Today we are merely men, not soldiers. Let us enjoy the simplicity of life,\\" Eothain responded with a wide grin. Their armor and garments found their places on the grassy shore, neatly folded and aside. The size contrast between them was clear; Amdir's physique was lean, built for agility and stamina, while Eothain, true to his Rohirric lineage, bore the broader, more powerful build of a horseman — one could almost imagine him wrestling a horse to the ground. Both bore the marks of warriors; scars that mapped their tales of survival and victory. Yet, in this moment of vulnerability, they were just two friends seeking respite in nature's embrace. Wading into the pond, the water caressed their skin, welcoming them into its cool embrace. \\"By the Valar, this is refreshing,\\" Amdir sighed, letting the water lap at his shoulders. \\"Indeed,\\" Eothain agreed, a smile playing on his lips. \\"It washes away more than just sweat and grime; it cleanses the soul.\\" The conversation flowed as easily as the water around them, ranging from light-hearted jests about each other's swimming style — or lack thereof — to reflections on battles past and the uncertain future. At one point, Eothain, claiming an ancient Rohirric tradition of camaraderie, began to wash Amdir's back, laughing at his friend's startled response. \\"In Rohan, this is a gesture of trust,\\" he explained, though the twinkle in his eye suggested a jest. \\"A trust that shall remain unbroken, then,\\" Amdir laughed, going along with the charade, grateful for the moment of light-heartedness. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of gold and crimson, their thoughts turned to sustenance. \\"I reckon it's time for a meal, what say you?\\" Eothain said, his stomach rumbling as if to punctuate his point. With a nod, they exited the pond, their spirits lifted. Without need for unorthodox fishing methods, they relied on their skills as hunters and gatherers. They managed to catch a few fish with a simple handmade spear and gathered roots and herbs from around the pond, their laughter and chatter blending with the rustling of leaves and the crackling of fire. As the fish cooked, Amdir mused, \\"You know, I never would've thought I'd find myself skinnydipping and foraging for dinner when I woke up this morning.\\" Eothain grinned, flipping a fish expertly. \\"Life in Middle-Earth is full of surprises.

In a small, secluded glade hidden away from the remnants of battle and the duty call of soldiers, Anborn, a brave Gondorian soldier, and Eadric, a stout Rohirric horseman, sought refuge in nature's embrace to ease the weight of war that burdened their spirits. Anborn, tall and lean, with the posture of a man who had faced many a foe, bore the dark, refined features of his people – raven-haired and olive-skinned, with eyes that sparkled like the Anduin under a noon sun. Eadric, in contrast, was a man of the Mark: broad-shouldered, with hair like fields of ripe wheat under a setting sun, and a physique built from years of riding under Rohan's open sky. \\"Anborn, my friend,\\" Eadric chuckled, his blue eyes twinkling with mischief, \\"you've been too long under the shadow. Let's strip the woes of this world and bathe as nature intended.\\" Anborn, though hesitant at first, conceded with a laugh. Together they undressed, their armor clattering softly on the grass, revealing the tales written on their bodies: scars of war, the mark of their commendable physiques, and even the competitive yet comedic comparison of their butts – Anborn's, firm and toned from years of marching, against Eadric's, broader and equally muscular from horseback riding. Their playful jests filled the air as they stepped nude into the pond, bodies reflecting the relaxing ambiance of their secluded haven. Eadric, with a twinkle in his eye, glanced at Anborn and remarked, \\"You Gondorians might have the march, but us Rohirrim understand the true art of relaxation.\\" Laughing, Anborn replied, \\"Perhaps, but let's see if your Rohirric methods can cleanse the weariness from these bones.\\" As Eadric relaxed into the water, Anborn took to washing his friend's back, moving in gentle, yet firm strokes – a silent testament to their brotherhood forged in battle. Their conversations meandered from tales of their homes to shared dreams of peace, echoing softly over the gentle lapping of water. It was during one such moment of silent contemplation that Eadric, feeling relief in both body and spirit, let out an unexpectedly loud and pungent fart. Both men froze for a heartbeat, before the surface erupted with laughter, echoing through the trees. Eadric, although flushed with slight embarrassment, grinned sheepishly, reveling in the lightness of being and the moment of hilarity. The waters around them bubbled with dying fish, victims of the deadly release. \\"Seems your Rohirric relaxation methods include fishing without a line,\\" Anborn quipped, unable to contain his amusement. Eadric laughed heartily, replying, \\"Aye, and it seems we've now dinner served by my behind!\\" Their laughter faded into comfortable camaraderie as they collected the unfortunate fish and lit a fire on the shore. The crackle of the flames accompanied their banter, as they roasted their unexpected catch, each jest and shared story a salve to the remnants of war within their hearts. \\"Who knew that a Rohirric wind could bring such a feast?\\" Anborn mused, his eyes alight with joy. Eadric, with a mischievous grin, retorted, \\"Next time, we'll aim for a boar. I reckon I've got the gust for it.\\" Under the stars, amidst laughter and the simple joy of friendship, Anborn and Eadric found solace. While their tale might not be sung in the halls of Minas Tirith or Edoras, in that moment, the bond of their fellowship was as grand as any tale of old, forged not in battle, but in the purity of laughter and the strange turn of events at a secluded pond."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman hanging out.

Theodor, a stout and hearty horseman of Rohan, with hair as golden as the fields of his homeland, had a physique that spoke of many days riding across vast landscapes. By his side was Aranthir, a lean and tall soldier of Gondor, whose dark hair and slightly more muscular build were hallmarks of his heritage. After a grueling skirmish near the borders, they both craved a moment of peace. \\"I think, my friend, it would do us good to wash off not just the grime of battle but also its weight. What say you to a bit of skinny-dipping?\\" Theodor suggested with a mischievous glint in his bright blue eyes. Aranthir, though usually more composed, could not help but chuckle at his friend's unorthodox idea. \\"Lead the way, then, Master Horseman. Let's hope the water is forgiving to two war-torn souls.\\" As they found a secluded pond, they undressed, comparing their battle scars, physiques, and even the state of their unmentionables in jest. Theodor's rounded, weathered backside and broad shoulders were a contrast to Aranthir's slightly more tapered and muscular form, a testament to their different fighting styles. Theodor's long, golden locks and Aranthir's shorter, darker hair also danced in the wind, adding to their moment of freedom. Entering the pond, they could not help but laugh at the sudden coolness enveloping them. Theodor started the conversation as he swam towards Aranthir. \\"You know, I never would've thought battling alongside a Gondorian would lead to… whatever this is,\\" he said, gesturing around them. Aranthir smiled, splashing water gently at his friend. \\"And I never imagined a Rohirric horseman would be the one to suggest skinny-dipping. Yet, here we are, and truly, I can say it's a welcome respite.\\" As they chatted, Theodor suggested with a half-joking tone, \\"You look tense, friend. Allow me to wash your back.\\" And thus, in the middle of this serene pond, Aranthir found himself chuckling as Theodor proceeded to scrub his back and even, with exaggerated care, his backside. It was then, in the midst of laughter and the absurdity of the situation, that Theodor, relaxed to a fault, accidentally released a pungent fart into the clear waters. The instant look of both horror and relief on his face was a sight to behold—his eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed as he sighed in release. The waters around them stirred, and, to their dismay and subsequent laughter, a few unfortunate fish floated to the surface, victims of the noxious gas. \\"By the Valar, Theodor! I knew your cooking was lethal, but I never took your farts to be deadly!\\" Aranthir exclaimed amidst bouts of laughter. Theodor, completely unabashed and still chuckling, retorted, \\"Well, it seems we've got ourselves dinner without needing to fish. Efficient, wouldn't you say?\\" Gathering the fish, they made a small fire near the pond and roasted their unintended catch. As they ate, they reflected on the absurdity and joy of their adventure. \\"Only you, Theodor, could turn skinny-dipping into a method of fishing,\\" Aranthir said, shaking his head with a smile. \\"And only you would still be here, breaking bread with me after such an ordeal,\\" replied Theodor, his laughter echoing around them. Beyond the camaraderie, their laughter, and the shared meal that came about in the most unexpected way, the moment offered them a brief respite from the world outside. In the company of a trusted friend, even the oddest moments could be treasured. And so, by the pond, skinny-dipping turned into an unforgettable story they would someday recount with great fondness, a testament to their bond and the peculiar memories made in the most unlikely of circumstances."},{"instruction":"What is Chinese for \\"message/messaging board\\"?","output":"The term for \\"message/messaging board\\" in Chinese can be translated as 论坛 (lùntán) or 留言板 (liúyán bǎn). 论坛 is more commonly used for forums or online community boards, where discussions and exchanges of information take place, while 留言板 refers to a board for leaving messages, often seen in more static contexts or online as a guestbook-type feature."},{"instruction":"What is the etymology of \\"论坛\\"?","output":"The Chinese term \\"论坛\\" (lùntán) is composed of two characters, each with its meaning, contributing to the term's overall significance as denoting a discussion forum or platform. 1. 论 (lùn) - This character has meanings related to discussion, theory, or opinion. It comes from classical Chinese, where it often referred to discussing or expounding on theories and ideas. The character comprises the speech or words radical (讠in simplified Chinese, 言 in traditional) on the left, indicating its relation to speech or discourse, and the phonetic component \\"仑\\" (lún) on the right, which contributes to its pronunciation. Historically, 论 has been used in contexts involving debate, discourse, and theoretical exploration. 2. 坛 (tán) - This character originally refers to an altar or a raised platform. It has connotations of a place where ceremonies or important activities are conducted. In ancient China, 坛 was a significant structure in religious and ceremonial contexts, symbolizing a space where heaven and earth connect, or where people gather for important events. Over time, its usage expanded to metaphorically represent platforms or stages for public speaking, gatherings, or discussions, beyond just the literal sense of a physical altar. Combined, 论坛 (lùntán) metaphorically refers to a platform or stage for discussion and exchange of ideas, mirroring the way forums (both online and offline) function as spaces where people gather to share opinions, debate theories, and engage in discourse. The term encapsulates the concept of a communal area dedicated to communication and discussion, evolving from its roots in literal and figurative meanings of its components."},{"instruction":"What is \\"image board\\" in Chinese?","output":"The term for \\"image board\\" in Chinese is 图片板 (túpiàn bǎn) or 图板 (túbǎn) for short.

You cannot jump over the lasers\\". This is a warning to urban explores wandering an abandoned factory or underground facility to not jump over activated lasers grids the find down there.","output":"Analyzing the sentence \\"Don't jump over the lasers. You cannot jump over the lasers\\" within the context of a warning to urban explorers in an abandoned facility, we can break down its components and intentions as follows: 1. **Imperative Sentence Structure**: The sentence begins with \\"Don't jump over,\\" which is a clear imperative statement. This structure is used to give commands or offer advice. By using the negative form \\"Don't,\\" the speaker immediately establishes the action of jumping over lasers as something that should not be attempted. 2. **Subject and Verb**: The implicit subject of the imperative sentence is \\"you,\\" although it is not explicitly stated. This is common in commands in English, where the subject is understood. The verb \\"jump\\" is the action that the speaker is advising against. 3. **Prepositional Phrase \\"over the lasers\\"**: This phrase specifies the action further. It's not just any jumping that is being discouraged, but specifically jumping over something, which is identified as \\"the lasers.\\" The use of \\"over\\" conveys a sense of attempting to cross something by leaping above it, indicating both the nature of the obstacle (the lasers) and the advised against action (leaping over them). 4. **Definitive Statement: \\"You cannot jump over the lasers.\\"**: Following the imperative advice is a definitive statement reinforcing the warning. This is not just advice; it is presented as a fact or a rule. The modal verb \\"cannot\\" expresses impossibility or inability. This suggests that jumping over the lasers is not just inadvisable but is considered practically impossible or exceedingly risky. 5. **Contextual Understanding**: Given the specified scenario, we understand this warning not just as literal advice but as an emphasis on the severity of the danger presented by the lasers. Lasers in an abandoned factory or underground facility could imply a security system or a hazardous environment. The repetition of the instruction not to jump over the lasers stresses the seriousness and the potential danger involved. 6. **Purpose and Tone**: The purpose of this sentence is cautionary, aimed at preventing harm. The tone could be considered urgent or stern, reflecting the potential dangers of the described action. This urgency is necessary in contexts where failing to heed the warning could result in serious injury or worse. In summary, this analysis shows how the sentence structure, choice of words, and the context in which they are delivered work together to convey a strong warning against a dangerous action, emphasizing both the prohibition and the physical impossibility or inadvisability of the action."},{"instruction":"How would it be written in Mandarin Chinese.","output":"The warning \\"Don't jump over the lasers.

Did a bit of browsing and it's all genuine Disney products inside. Felt like walking into a mini Disneyland gift shop. 😄 **BrandWatcher21**: That's really interesting you mention Kangurola. It makes me wonder if this is Disney trying something new with their branding strategy. Anyone remember when ITV in the UK unified all its regional stations under one national identity back in 2002? Maybe Disney is flipping the script here; creating unique store identities while keeping the content strictly Disney. **DisneyMagicFan98**: @BrandWatcher21, that’s a fascinating angle. Disney going the opposite direction of ITV would indeed be an intriguing strategy. Gives each store its own personality while still flying the Disney flag. But makes me also wonder, what's the endgame? Are they trying to transition to making \\"Disney+\\" the core brand while letting physical stores have different, localized names? **LocalHistorian**: As a lover of how brands evolve, I’d say @DisneyMagicFan98 might be onto something. Disney+ has definitely become a household name, and having a streaming service as the front runner in their branding makes sense in the digital age. However, keeping the magic of Disney alive in physical spaces through unique stores like Kangurola adds a personal touch that you can't get online. **PopCultureGuru**: Interesting theory indeed! It’s like Disney is covering all bases; strengthening their digital presence with Disney+ while capturing local markets and tourist shoppers with these unique, themed stores. It’s a smart move, diversifying their engagement points but keeping the brand essence universally Disney. **TechTrendFollower**: I do wonder about the logistics and brand coherence, though. If Disney starts spinning out stores under various names like Kangurola, how will they ensure the brand message remains consistent? Or is the idea to celebrate diversity within the Magic Kingdom? Either way, keeping the Disney+ name as their umbrella brand online while letting retail stores have their own identities is an innovative approach. **DisneyMagicFan98**: All valid points! Whether it’s an official test strategy by Disney or just a one-off store like Kangurola tapping into the Disney mania, it’s an exciting development for us fans and makes our little town of Fuengirola part of something bigger and magical. Can't wait to see how this plays out! **EuroTriviaMaster**: Definitely, no matter the business strategy, having a store like Kangurola in Fuengirola only adds to our town's charm. And it's a win for Disney fans and tourists alike. Here’s hoping we see more unique Disney-themed stores popping up! **BrandWatcher21**: Will be interesting to monitor how this progresses.

Have you seen the news about the store next to Bioparc in Fuengirola? It looks like it avoided the Disney rebrand wave... until now. Just passed by, and there’s a new sign up. It features Perry the Platypus and teases a \\"2-week transformation\\" starting next week. Anyone know what they're planning? Staff were already in new uniforms, which looked kinda different, more vibrant maybe? **MagicFanatic101**: Really? I thought that store was going to stay as it was. Any clue on the theme or the new name it'll be adopting? And the uniforms, are they completely different from the usual Disney Store outfits? **BioparcNeighbor**: I work nearby and talked to one of the staff. They’re tight-lipped about the specifics but hinted it’s going to be something special and unique. Like @DisneyDreamer45 mentioned, the uniforms have a new color scheme - lots of greens and blues, very \\"Perry\\" inspired I guess? **EuroDisneyHistorian**: This is fascinating! With the recent trend of localizing stores, I wonder how they’ll incorporate the Fuengirola vibe with the Disney magic. **Perry the Platypus** could suggest a \\"Phineas and Ferb\\" themed experience. That’d be a first. **ScottishDisneyFan**: Speaking of changes, heard Glasgow is joining the rebrand train. Our store in the city center will soon become **GlasWorld**. Seems every store is getting a unique identity tied to its location. I’m all for it – makes each visit feel exclusive. **CollectibleHunter**: Has anyone heard if these transformations will include exclusive merchandise? A **Phineas and Ferb** themed store next to Bioparc could have some really unique finds, especially Perry merch. Glasgow's GlasWorld could potentially offer something unique to Scotland-Disney fusion collectibles? **ThemeparkJunkie**: @CollectibleHunter, that’s my hope! It’s an interesting strategy from Disney, making each store a destination in itself. Besides merchandise, imagining the in-store experiences and decorations gets me excited. Every visit could be a whole new adventure. **BioparcNeighbor**: Just a quick update: saw the staff receiving new merchandise boxes with some pretty cool artwork on the side. Couldn't get a close look, but it seems like they’re already stocking up. This transformation to... whatever it will be called, seems like it's going to be a huge deal! **MagicFanatic101**: Thanks for the update, @BioparcNeighbor! It’s all quite intriguing. These localized themes could really redefine Disney Store visits. Also, excited to see how **GlasWorld** turns out. Disney is weaving its magic into every city’s fabric. **DisneyDreamer45**: Appreciate everyone's insights! This is a significant shift from Disney, but I’m loving the community feel it’s inspiring. Can't wait to see the Fuengirola store post-transformation, and hoping for a road trip to **GlasWorld** soon. Keep sharing any new info or changes you all notice!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where the new look is OWCA Gift Shop (also Doofenshmirtz store), A user wonders why they didn't use the same new branding they have used elsewhere throughout the city","output":"**DisneyDreamer45**: 🎉 The transformation is complete, folks! The store next to Bioparc in Fuengirola has officially reopened as the **OWCA Gift Shop**. And here's a twist - it also doubles as a **Doofenshmirtz Store**. It’s totally decked out in a *Phineas and Ferb* theme, from the décor to the merchandise. It’s a brilliant nod to the Organization Without a Cool Acronym and the infamous Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Has anyone had the chance to check it out yet? **EuroDisneyHistorian**: Visited earlier today! They’ve outdone themselves. Half of the store is Perry themed, and the other is all about Doofenshmirtz's inventions. It's interactive, fun, and quite innovative. Even saw a couple of kids playing around what they called the \\"Inator\\" section. Lots of laughs! **MagicFanatic101**: That sounds amazing! But I'm curious, with the recent rebrandings like **GlasWorld** being more tied to the locale's identity, why go with OWCA and Doofenshmirtz in Fuengirola? Did anyone catch the reason behind not adopting the new city-specific branding theme here? **BioparcNeighbor**: Good question, @MagicFanatic101. I asked one of the staff members the same thing. They mentioned that the decision was based on Fuengirola’s unique position as a hub for families and tourists who cherish animated stories and characters. They wanted to create an immersive experience that stood out and directly engaged with fans of *Phineas and Ferb*, given its popularity among both local and international visitors. **CollectibleHunter**: That makes a lot of sense, @BioparcNeighbor. Plus, having exclusive merchandise like the Doofenshmirtz Inator replicas and limited-edition Perry plushies can really draw in the crowds. It’s a clever way to offer something unique that capitalizes on the show's fanbase. **ScottishDisneyFan**: Fascinated by this approach! I initially thought all stores would follow a similar rebranding strategy focused on local culture. But integrating a beloved show and creating a specialized theme store adds an exciting layer to Disney's retail experience. Can't wait to see if they implement more themed stores like this! **ThemeparkJunkie**: Definitely a bold move from Disney, but it’s super engaging. Imagining the possibilities here - what if they open other theme-specific stores around the globe, blending local culture with Disney narratives? The potential for new, immersive shopping experiences is endless. **BioparcNeighbor**: It’s been buzzing with energy since the reopening. The blend of a show-centric theme with interactive elements definitely stands out among the more locally named stores. As much as I love the city-specific branding, the **OWCA Gift Shop** feels like a destination in its own right, offering something uniquely Disney. **MagicFanatic101**: Thanks for shedding light on that, everyone. It’ll be interesting to see how Disney balances these themed stores with the city-specific rebranded ones in the future. Each approach brings something different to the table, enriching the Disney retail experience in diverse ways. Can't wait to check out the OWCA Gift Shop in person!"},{"instruction":"Write a tweet saying they went with a P&F style instead of keeping the shop as is and just plastering the new Fuengirola-centric name used in the middle of the city and in Miramar on it","output":"\\"Just checked out the newly reopened Disney store by Bioparc in Fuengirola and it's not what I expected!

I want to take a moment to address how these changes impact our store, particularly the one you've dedicated so much effort and passion to here next to Bioparc in Fuengirola.

Instead, we are embracing an opportunity to create something unique that resonates with both locals and visitors alike, leading to the transformation into the OWCA Gift Shop & Doofenshmirtz Store. This decision stems from our goal to offer an immersive experience that not only delights but also brings to life the beloved world of *Phineas and Ferb*, offering something distinct and engaging for our customers.

Here's a breakdown of why shrimp can come with a higher price tag: 1. **Farming and Harvesting Costs**: Shrimp farming requires significant upfront investment in terms of aquaculture infrastructure, feed, and maintenance to mimic their natural habitat and optimize growth. Wild-caught shrimp also involves considerable expenses, including fuel, labor, and maintenance of fishing vessels, and the operation must comply with sustainable fishing regulations to prevent overfishing and environmental damage. 2. **Supply and Demand**: Global demand for shrimp is high, and it's considered a delicacy in many cultures. In regions where shrimp is not locally available, it needs to be imported, which leads to increased prices due to the demand outpacing the supply. 3. **Processing and Transportation**: Shrimp must be quickly processed, frozen, or refrigerated after being caught or harvested to maintain its quality. This process, along with packaging and transportation costs—especially for imported shrimp—adds to the retail price. The longer the supply chain from the point of catch or harvest to the consumer's plate, the higher the cost. 4. **Environmental and Regulatory Factors**: Aquaculture farms and wild shrimp fisheries must adhere to environmental regulations and standards that ensure sustainable and responsible practices. Compliance with these standards can increase operational costs. For example, measures to protect mangroves (where many wild shrimps breed) or to reduce bycatch (unintended catch) can add to the costs. 5. **Size and Quality**: Larger shrimp and specific species often command higher prices due to their perceived superior taste and texture. Additionally, organically farmed or wild-caught shrimp, which are marketed as being healthier and more environmentally friendly, are usually more expensive than their conventionally farmed counterparts. 6. **Market Dynamics**: Tariffs, taxes, and trade agreements between countries can significantly impact the price of shrimp. Import quotas or restrictions can also lead to price fluctuations. Moreover, diseases affecting shrimp populations, such as the early mortality syndrome (EMS) that has impacted farms in several countries, can reduce supply and drive up prices. 7. **Seasonality**: Like many seafood products, shrimp prices can fluctuate depending on the season. Outside of peak harvest times, prices can increase due to lower availability. In summary, while shrimp is a popular and highly sought-after seafood, its production and distribution are subject to a variety of costs related to farming practices, supply chain logistics, regulatory compliance, and market forces. These factors collectively contribute to the higher prices consumers may observe for shrimp compared to other types of seafood or protein sources."},{"instruction":"write a youtube script about this topic , 2000 words","output":"Creating a detailed 2000-word script for a YouTube video on why shrimp is so expensive would exceed the response limits here.

Jetix was a worldwide children's television programming brand owned by Jetix Europe, Jetix Latin America, and ABC Cable Networks Group (Disney). The brand was used for blocks and channels featuring action and adventure-related content, primarily targeting boys aged 6 to 11. It was launched globally in 2004 and operated until its gradual merge into Disney XD (or the Disney Channel in some regions) by 2009/2010. The absence of Jetix shows on Disney+ may stem from several factors rather than an intentional effort to erase the brand: 1. **Licensing and Rights Issues:** Disney may not hold the streaming rights for all the shows that were once part of Jetix. Some content was licensed from other studios, and these licenses might restrict Disney's ability to stream these shows on their platforms. 2. **Demand and Strategy:** Disney+ might be focusing on content that aligns with its current branding and content strategy, prioritizing newer Disney+ originals, popular Disney franchises, or content that has a wider and more global appeal. 3. **Content Library Decisions:** With a vast library of content, Disney might be selecting shows and movies based on what they believe will attract and retain subscribers. Nostalgic value plays a role, but commercial considerations likely dominate these decisions. 4. **Localization and Region-Specific Content:** Some shows may be available in Disney+ libraries in specific regions but not globally, depending on local popularity and relevance. That said, Disney has not officially stated that they are trying to erase or disregard the Jetix brand. The dynamics of online streaming services are complex and involve strategic choices about what content to include based on a range of factors mentioned above. Moreover, fan interest and nostalgia for Jetix content are noted by many, and it's possible that more Jetix shows could appear on Disney+ or other platforms in the future as the service continues to expand and evolve its content offerings."},{"instruction":"They did add SRMTHFG in the US,","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, if \\"Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!\\" (SRMTHFG) has been added to Disney+ in the United States, that's a positive development for fans of the Jetix brand and its shows. SRMTHFG is one of the original series associated with Jetix, known for its unique blend of American cartoon styles and Japanese anime influences. Its appearance on Disney+ indicates that Disney is open to including Jetix content on its streaming platform, perhaps in response to fan demand or as part of a broader strategy to diversify the types of shows available to subscribers. The addition of SRMTHFG may suggest several things: 1. **Fan Interest:** There's a significant nostalgia and interest in shows from the 2000s, including those aired on Jetix. Adding such content could be a response to fan requests and a way to appeal to broader demographics, including young adults who grew up with these shows. 2. **Content Strategy:** Disney+ is continuously looking to expand its content library with diverse offerings to appeal to different interests and age groups. Incorporating shows from the Jetix era could be part of enriching the service's catalog. 3. **Testing the Waters:** Adding SRMTHFG might also be a way for Disney to test the waters and gauge interest in Jetix content among Disney+ subscribers. Positive reception could lead to more Jetix shows being added in the future. While the presence of SRMTHFG on Disney+ is a hopeful sign for fans of Jetix content, it's crucial to note that decisions about content availability can be complex and driven by multiple factors, including licensing agreements, content strategy, and subscriber interest. Still, the inclusion of such shows demonstrates that aspects of the Jetix catalog have not been forgotten and hold potential value for streaming platforms like Disney+."},{"instruction":"Create an OP FM24 tactic that uses a vertical tiki taka and a 4-3-3 formation.

Despite the chaos that enveloped their world, these two had managed to find humor and lightness in their camaraderie. One golden afternoon, as the sun dipped low, casting ethereal hues over the landscape, Haldor, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, proposed an idea to unwind. \\"Eradan, my friend, what say you we embrace the old Rohan tradition of skinnydipping? A surefire way to alleviate the weight of war.\\" Eradan, though initially taken aback by the boldness of the suggestion, couldn't resist a chuckle. \\"Only you, Haldor, would suggest such a thing. Lead the way.\\" The two friends made their way to a secluded pond, hidden away by ancient trees. With a mixture of hesitation and amusement, they began to undress. Eradan, with his sturdy Gondorian physique, bore a broad yet lean build, his skin battle-worn but resilient. His posterior, much like the rest of him, was solid and well-formed, a testament to his rigorous training. Haldor, on the other hand, boasted the muscular, agile body of a Rohirric horseman. His backside, though not as heavily muscular as Eradan's, was compact and powerful, shaped by years of horseback riding. Their hair, too, was a subject of contrast. Eradan's raven locks were cropped short, practical for a soldier, while Haldor's golden mane reached his shoulders, a wild, untamed mass reflective of his free spirit. As they stepped into the pond, the cold water sent a shiver up their spines. Eradan, ever the pragmatic, began to scrub away the grime of battle, while Haldor reveled in the freedom of the moment. The warmth of friendship and the coolness of the water mingled, creating an atmosphere of ease and laughter. Their conversation flowed as easily as the water around them. \\"You know, Eradan,\\" Haldor mused, his voice echoing softly against the water, \\"I never thought I'd find myself in such a... compromising position with a Gondorian.\\" \\"And I never thought I'd be convinced to partake in Rohan's peculiar customs,\\" Eradan retorted, a smile evident in his voice as he reached over to help Haldor clean his back, an act of camaraderie. It was then, in that moment of vulnerability and trust, that a sudden, unexpected sound shattered the tranquility. A pungent fart, unleashed by Haldor, rippled through the waters, a toxic cloud enveloping them. Eradan recoiled, a mix of horror and disbelief on his face, while Haldor, mortified, burst into uncontrollable laughter. \\"By the Valar, I did not see that coming,\\" Eradan exclaimed, pinching his nose. \\"Consider it a gift from Rohan!\\" Haldor managed between bouts of laughter. The laughter, however, died down as they noticed a few fish floating lifelessly to the surface, victims of the lethal gas. Thoughts of waste never far from their minds, they saw an opportunity. \\"I suppose we've found our supper,\\" Haldor remarked, still chuckling. With a roll of his eyes, Eradan agreed, and they set about collecting the unfortunate fish, later roasting them over a fire. As they sat, sharing the meal, the ridiculousness of the situation wasn't lost on them. \\"Only we could weaponize a fart to catch dinner,\\" Eradan mused. Haldor, through mouthfuls of fish, replied, \\"A true Rohirric tactic. Efficient, unexpected, and deadly.\\" Their laughter echoed into the night, a beacon of light and friendship in a world often shadowed by darkness. For in that moment, they were not a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman; they were simply two friends, sharing in the absurdity of life."},{"instruction":"Create an OP FM24 tactic that uses a vertical tiki taka and a 4-3-3 formation.

Eldarion, a sprightly Gondorian soldier with a frame as slender as the willow, bore the tranquil beauty of the twilight stars in his radiant eyes, his skin alight with the soft glow of silver moonbeams. His companion, Baldor, a burly Rohirric horseman, possessed the robust build of ancient oaks, his broad shoulders casting shadows that danced with the flames of campfires, his thick beard a testament to the untamed wilderness of his homeland. In the wake of war, the echoes of laughter had grown scarce, and the weight of their duty bore heavily upon their spirits. It was during one such evening, as they shared tales beneath the velvet sky, that Baldor, with a grin wide as the Anduin, proposed a venture most unconventional. \\"Come now, Eldarion,\\" he boomed, his laughter shaking the leaves from their perch, \\"Let us cast away the shackles of armor and the burdens of war. There lies a pond, hidden beyond the bend, where the waters are as clear as crystal. What say you to a spot of skinnydipping?\\" Eldarion's eyes sparkled with mischief, and with a nod, they embarked upon their escapade. Upon reaching the secluded pond, they undressed, their armors and garments discarded like the worries they sought to escape. Eldarion, slender and lithe, his body a tapestry of moonlit beauty, contrasted sharply with Baldor’s rugged, powerful form. Eldarion's posterior, dainty and firm, seemed almost sculpted by Elven hands, while Baldor's, vast and robust, bore the marks of countless rides across the plains. As they entered the pond, ripples danced around them, carrying their laughter to the moon. Eldarion’s porcelain skin glimmered beneath the water, while Baldor’s rugged frame cut through the pond with the strength of a mighty ship’s prow. Their conversation flowed as freely as the waters that enveloped them. Eldarion, ever the caring soul, began to wash Baldor’s broad back, his hands moving with care across the expanse of muscle and scar, a silent testament to battles fought and won. “Ah, that’s the spot, my friend,” Baldor sighed, a contented smile upon his face. It was then, amidst the tranquility of the pond and the comfort of their camaraderie, that an unexpected guest arrived to the party—a pungent fart that slipped from Baldor, its presence announced not by sound but by the sudden stir of the once-peaceful waters. Eldarion paused, his hands still mid-air, a mixture of amusement and disbelief painted across his face. “Baldor,” he began, a chuckle threatening to break free, “did the depths of this pond just declare war upon us?” Baldor, red as the setting sun, let out a hearty laugh, the sound echoing off the trees. “Seems like the fish have taken quite the liking to Rohirric cuisine!” To their astonishment, some fish, victims of the underwater assault, floated up, lifeless yet offering an unexpected bounty. With laughter that could wake the Ents, they collected their aquatic harvest and set about roasting it over a crackling fire. As the flames danced and the fish cooked, Baldor remarked, “Never thought my rear would turn into a weapon of mass destruction, nor that it would provide us dinner.” Eldarion, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes, replied, “Only in the company of a Rohirric horseman could one find warfare, wonder, and a feast, all born from a single fart.” Together, they feasted beneath the stars, their laughter a beacon of light in dark times, a reminder that amidst the shadows of the world, joy and friendship could always be found."},{"instruction":"Create an OP FM24 tactic that uses a vertical tiki taka and a 4-3-3 formation.

Let's dive into the slightly absurd yet light-hearted adventure of our Gondorian soldier and Rohirric horseman. --- In the vast and varied landscapes of Middle Earth, where the tales of heroes and the mythical often eclipse the simple joys of life, there lived two unlikely friends. Ethelred, a lithe and quick-witted Gondorian soldier with a flair for dramatics, and Borogrove, a robust and hearty Rohirric horseman, whose laughter was as infectious as it was loud. One sunny day, amidst the never-ending duties and drills, Ethelred was more somber than usual. He missed the tranquil gardens of Minas Tirith, the serene sound of the fountain courtyards, and the simple pleasure of a peaceful day. Borogrove clapped him on the back, almost tipping Ethelred over with his enthusiastic but friendly gesture. \\"What say you, friend? Let's go seek an adventure that doesn't involve swinging swords or dodging arrows!\\" Ethelred, curious and slightly hesistant asked, \\"And what kind of adventure do you have in mind, Borogrove?\\" Grinning like a child who knew a secret too delightful to keep, Borogrove announced, \\"Skinny dipping! There's a hidden pond near the edge of Fangorn Forest, as clear as crystal and as fresh as the new dawn. It'll wash away our worries... and maybe some grime too.\\" The suggestion was met with a mix of disbelief and amusement. Yet, before long, they were on their way, their laughter filling the air. Upon reaching the secluded pond, they disrobed, throwing teasing remarks about each other’s warrior bodies. Ethelred, sleek and toned, with the grace of a panther, boasted a rear that was more akin to a sculpted piece of art, while his chest was lightly dusted with hair as dark as the night. Borogrove, on the other hand, was as broad and sturdy as an oak, a true horseman of Rohan, with a brawn built from years of training and battle. His back was a canvas of muscles, and his behind was as firm as the rocks of Helms Deep, covered in a thicket of golden hair that matched his wild mane. As they entered the pond, the water embraced their differences, and laughter echoed around the glade. \\"You look like you could disappear in these waters, Ethelred!\\" Borogrove chuckled, his voice echoing off the water. \\"And you look like an Ent that's taken a wrong turn,\\" Ethelred retorted with a grin. As they settled in the water, Ethelred began helping his friend wash, starting with his broad back and moving downwards. They talked of everything and nothing, their friendship a testament to the unity of their peoples. Borogrove, so relaxed and at ease in the tranquil waters and under his friend's careful ministrations, let out a sudden and startlingly loud fart. The bubbles raced to the surface, popping with a comedic sound that broke the serene silence. For a moment, time stood still. Then, as the stench hit them, both burst into uncontrollable laughter. The laughter only grew when they noticed a few unfortunate fish float to the surface, victims of the pungent assault. \\"Well, that's one way to catch dinner,\\" Ethelred managed to say between fits of laughter. Borogrove, equally amused, replied, \\"Who knew my backside held the power to lay siege to the fishes?\\" With laughter still in their hearts, they exited the water, collected the fish, and set about roasting them over a fire. The absurdity of their situation only added to the taste, each bite a reminder of their lighthearted adventure. \\"As long as the winds carry tales,\\" Borogrove said, taking a bite of the perfectly roasted fish, \\"let them speak of the day when fish fell to the might of a Rohirric wind.\\" \\"And let them marvel,\\" Ethelred added, his eyes sparkling with humor, \\"at the friendship that could withstand such a trial.\\" The two friends ate, laughed, and enjoyed the simplicity of their bond, a testament to the enduring friendship between Gondor and Rohan, forged not just in battle, but in shared moments of joy, laughter, and even the most unorthodox of methods to catch dinner."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a twink Gondorian soldier and a burly Rohirric horseman hanging out.

Our story unfolds with two unlikely friends: Aerendir, a lithe and effulgent Gondorian soldier with a wit as sharp as his sword, and Eadric, a burly and jovial Rohirric horseman whose laughter could shake the very leaves from the trees. As the orange hues of a waning day painted the world, the air was thick with the remnants of battles fought and won. Eadric, noticing the crease on Aerendir's forehead deepening by the day, decided that a momentary escape was in order. \\"Aerendir,\\" he bellowed, patting his friend’s back a tad too loudly, \\"the weight of the world need not rest solely on those slender shoulders. Let us away to the woods and find a pond. I've heard a dip in cool waters can ease even the most troubled of minds.\\" Though initially hesitant, Aerendir could not resist the infectious enthusiasm of his friend. The pair ventured into the woods, their laughter echoing through the trees, until they found a secluded pond, its surface like polished glass. With a mischievous gleam in his eyes, Eadric suggested, \\"Let's make it more interesting – skinnydipping it is!\\" As they undressed, there was an unspoken competition of physical comparison. Aerendir, with his svelte, almost ethereal form, had a fairness to him that seemed to catch the fleeting light. His backside was as meticulously sculpted as one of the famed Gondorian statues, and his body hair was so fair it was almost nonexistent, giving him an almost otherworldly appearance. Eadric, on the other hand, was a monument to Rohirric strength; his physique broad and muscular, his backside, like the rest of him, was powerful and defined. His body was adorned with a map of hair as golden as the fields of Rohan, a testament to his heritage. With a mix of elegance and clumsiness, they descended into the water, an orchestra of gasps and laughter blending with the evening air as the cool pond embraced them. Aerendir, taking the notion of camaraderie seriously, offered to wash Eadric's back. The gentle strokes on his broad back were met with contented sighs, allowing a silence filled with camaraderie to permeate the air. \\"It feels like all the troubles of the world are just a mere whisper now,\\" Eadric closed his eyes, sinking deeper into relaxation. \\"Yes, a moment of peace in an endless storm,\\" Aerendir replied, his hands now attending to his friend’s broad and, surprisingly, quite tense buttocks with care, trying to ease the tension there as well. It was then, in the tranquility of that secluded pond, that Eadric, perhaps too relaxed, let out a pungent fart, the ripples of which disturbed not only the water but also the fish swimming beneath. Surprised by his own body's betrayal, Eadric's eyes popped open, and for a moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, Aerendir burst into laughter, the sound clear and mirthful, \\"By the Valar, Eadric! Did you mean to declare war on the fish with that?\\" Eadric, a shade of red not known to Rohirrim spread across his face, managed a sheepish grin, \\"Seems I've slain more foes today than in any battle.\\" As if on cue, several fish, victims of the noxious assault, floated to the surface. The friends, seizing the opportunity, collected their unintended bounty. They made a fire and roasted the fish, laughter and stories filling the air as the moon rose high. \\"Eadric, we must do this more often,\\" Aerendir said between bites, \\"though, maybe with less warfare on the aquatic life.\\" \\"Aye, Aerendir. Next time, I'll make sure only the logs catch fire,\\" Eadric chuckled, patting his friend on the back. And so, in a world besieged by shadows, a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman found light in their friendship and laughter, a reminder that amidst adversity, joy can still flourish."},{"instruction":"what is billy genes government name from billy gene is marketing","output":"Billy Gene Shaw"},{"instruction":"is his name billy or william","output":"His government name is William Gene Shaw, but he is commonly known as Billy Gene."},{"instruction":"definitin of name billy","output":"The name Billy is a diminutive form of the name William.

ATENÇÃO AS DIRETRIZES • Recomendamos iniciar com uma oferta energética mais baixa, cerca de 15 a 20 kcal/kg, e progredir para 25 a 30 kcal/kg, entre o 4º e o 7º dia, aos pacientes que já se encontram na fase pós aguda/recuperação. (BRASPEN,2023) • Recomendamos que doentes críticos recebam até 1,2 g de proteína/kg de peso/dia na fase inicial da doença, aproximadamente até o D4. Após o D4, considerando que o paciente não esteja em sua fase aguda inicial, recomendamos evoluir a oferta para 1,3 e 2 g de proteína/ kg de peso/dia. (BRASPEN,2023) • Quais as recomendações especiais aos pacientes traumatizados? Nas fases precoces, as metas de energia/proteína devem ser alcançadas progressivamente, assim como no paciente crítico. Ao longo da fase de recuperação, há necessidade de reajuste do plano nutricional para ofertas calóricas, que podem alcançar 40 kcal/kg/dia e de necessidades proteicas de até 2,0-2,5 g/kg de peso. (BRASPEN,2023) • As fórmulas com glutamina ou outros imunonutrientes devem ser consideradas no trauma, com potencial benefício em cicatrização e desfecho em alguns subgrupos, como, por exemplo, no traumatismo cranioencefálico (TCE).

(1,0 pt)","output":"1. A classificação do paciente pelo método de triagem nutricional NRS-2002 seria de alto risco, considerando os seguintes pontos: o paciente está internado no hospital devido a um acidente grave com consequente trauma (fratura de fêmur e TCE), o que automaticamente coloca o paciente em uma situação de maior necessidade nutricional pela condição clínica grave e pelo estresse metabólico associado. Além disso, a NRS-2002 leva em conta a gravidade da doença e a condição nutricional. Apesar de não ter perdido peso ou apresentado alterações de ingestão calórica antes do acidente, o trauma grave faz com que a demanda nutricional e metabólica seja aumentada, classificando-o assim como de alto risco. 2. O método de avaliação nutricional mais adequado para este paciente é a Avaliação Subjetiva Global (ASG) modificada, que se adapta melhor aos pacientes hospitalizados e críticos. Isso porque a ASG é capaz de fornecer uma visão compreensiva do estado nutricional do paciente através de uma série de perguntas relacionadas à perda de peso, ingestão alimentar, sintomas gastrointestinais que duram mais de 2 semanas, capacidade funcional, metabolismo e exame físico focado na composição corporal. Este método é justificado pela condição clínica do paciente, que está em um estado de saúde severamente comprometido e pode sofrer rápida mudança de seu estado nutricional devido ao trauma. 3. Planejamento para execução da prescrição nutricional: Valor energético calórico: 1270 - 1905 kcal no período inicial, progredindo para 1588 - 2223 kcal. Método e peso utilizado: Calculado com base em 20-30 kcal/kg no período inicial, usando o peso atual do paciente, 63,5 kg, e progredindo para 25-35 kcal/kg entre o 4º e o 7º dia. 4. De acordo com a avaliação metabólica e as diretrizes recomendadas para pacientes traumáticos, a dieta recomendada deve ser rica em proteínas e considerar o uso de imunonutrientes como a glutamina. Portanto, uma fórmula enteral enriquecida com glutamina e adequada em proteínas seria a mais indicada para o caso do paciente com TCE e trauma grave. Dentre as opções disponíveis no link fornecido, uma fórmula que atenda às necessidades de glutamina adicionada e que proporcione uma boa quantidade de proteína seria a escolhida. É importante verificar as opções disponíveis para especificar a fórmula e a apresentação, considerando as necessidades metabólicas aumentadas e o objetivo de promover a cicatrização e recuperação. 5. Prescrição nutricional completa: - Fórmula enteral com prevalência de proteínas e enriquecida com glutamina, adequada para atender a até 2,0-2,5 g/kg/dia de necessidades proteicas na fase de recuperação. A seleção específica da fórmula dependerá da disponibilidade no link fornecido, mas a escolha deve priorizar essas especificações. - Iniciar com 20 kcal/kg/dia, totalizando aproximadamente 1270 kcal/dia, progredindo para 25-35 kcal/kg conforme tolerância e necessidade, atingindo aproximadamente 1588 - 2223 kcal/dia. - Proteínas: Iniciar com 1,2 g/kg/dia, totalizando aproximadamente 76 g/dia, e progredir conforme recomendado para até 2,0 - 2,5 g/kg/dia, dependendo da tolerância e da fase de recuperação do paciente, podendo chegar até 159 g/dia. - A administração deve respeitar a tolerância gastrointestinal do paciente, iniciando com volumes menores e aumentando progressivamente conforme tolerado. - Monitorização diária da tolerância gastrintestinal, sinais de repleção gástrica ou diarreia, ajustando a velocidade de infusão e a concentração da fórmula conforme necessário. - Avaliação contínua do estado nutricional para ajustes na prescrição conforme a evolução clínica e metabólica do paciente. Nota: Para especificar a fórmula a ser utilizada, é necessário consultar o link fornecido para escolher a opção que melhor atende às diretrizes mencionadas, incluindo a composição detalhada de macronutrientes e a presença de imunonutrientes como a glutamina."},{"instruction":"Hey","output":"Hello!

The morning sun shines brightly, casting its glow through the windows and onto the faces of our unique protagonists, Cat and Dog, who are sound asleep. **Narrator:** In the world of CatDog, every day is an adventure waiting to happen. But our story today begins in the most unusual way – with a dream. [**Scene 1: CatDog's Living Room**] Cat (stretching and yawning): Ah, another perfect day for some peace, quiet, and perhaps, a dive into my collection of fine art literature. Dog, already wide awake, shakes his entire body excitedly, causing Cat to almost lose his balance. Dog (enthusiastically): Or we could go digging at the park! I heard there's gonna be a big bone buried there today! Cat (sighing): We just went to the park yesterday. Must we go through this rigmarole every morning? Before they can decide, their peculiar friend Winslow, a smart-aleck mouse, appears from a hole in the wall. Winslow: You guys are thinkin' way too small! The circus is in town, and they have a contest. The most unique act wins a year’s supply of \\"Fishy Friskies\\" for you, Cat, and a lifetime membership at the \\"Bark Park\\" for you, Dog. Cat and Dog exchange a look, a mixture of excitement and apprehension. [**Scene 2: Nearburg Circus**] In a bustling circus filled with the most fantastical acts, from fire-breathing dragons to a unicycle-riding octopus, CatDog stands out the most. They're signing up for the talent show, somewhat unsure of what their act will be. Cat (whispering to Dog): We need an act that showcases both of our talents... something that combines elegance and... chaos. Dog (nodding): Yeah! Like, we could do a super cool trick with Frisbees! Cat (rolling his eyes): Oh, sure, because nothing says elegance like a slobber-covered Frisbee. Suddenly, an idea strikes them both. They look at each other, nods of agreement passing between them. [**Scene 3: CatDog's Talent Show Performance**] The spotlight shines on CatDog. The auditorium is packed, the crowd hushed in anticipation. Cat starts off with a majestic piano solo, his paws dancing over the keys in a captivating melody. Just as the audience starts to get drawn in, Dog springs into action, leaping through hoops, juggling balls, and even riding a skateboard around the stage – all without missing a beat of Cat's performance. But then, in a mishap characteristic of our protagonists, Dog accidentally jumps too high and lands on the piano, causing a cacophony of sounds. The audience gasps, but then CatDog does something unexpected – they turn the mishap into a part of their act, with Cat playing an improvised tune that perfectly complements Dog's chaotic energy. The crowd erupts in applause, captivated by their unique synergy. [**Final Scene**] The ringmaster, unable to hide his admiration, awards them the grand prize. Cat, with a rare look of contentment, cuddles his year’s supply of \\"Fishy Friskies,” while Dog rolls around happily with his \\"Bark Park\\" membership card. **Narrator:** And so, in the wonderful world of CatDog, our heroes once again prove that no matter how different they are, together, they can tackle anything life throws at them – even a talent show at the circus. [**Closing Shot**] The camera zooms out of the circus tent, the laughter and applause fading into the night. The stars twinkle above, mirroring the light of our dynamic duo’s unbreakable bond. **Narrator:** In Nearburg, where the unusual is the usual, CatDog remains the most extraordinary tale of two tails.

Inside, Glenn Martin, DDS, the ever-optimistic dentist, is meticulously organizing his portable dental equipment. The sun shines through the windows, suggesting another day of adventure. However, not everything is as bright as it seems. **Narrator:** The Martins are ready for another day of exploration and family fun, but little do they know, a tiny intruder is about to turn their day—and Glenn’s dental practice—upside down. [**Scene 1: Inside the RV**] Glenn (cheerfully): All right, team, who's ready to explore the Grand Canyon and maybe even find some folks in need of dental rescue? Jackie, his supportive wife, is preparing breakfast, while their kids, Conor and Courtney, are less than enthusiastic, absorbed in their gadgets. Jackie (with concern): Glenn, are you feeling okay? You look a bit...pale. Glenn (dismissing the concern with a wave): Nonsense! I've never felt better. A Martin doesn’t let a little paleness slow him down. Suddenly, Glenn sneezes loudly, startling Amigo, their loyal dog, and almost dropping a dental mirror. Conor (sarcastically): Looks like Dad's caught the dentist flu. Is that like, a professional hazard? [**Scene 2: Grand Canyon National Park**] Ignoring his mild symptoms, Glenn sets up a makeshift dental clinic near a bustling tourist spot in the park. Visitors seem intrigued by the offer of a free dental check-up in such an unusual setting. However, as Glenn begins his work, his flu symptoms worsen. He tries to soldier on, offering dental advice between sneezes and coughs, much to the concern and slight amusement of his patients. Glenn (struggling to speak clearly): And remember, flossing is essential to–achoo!–maintaining good dental–cough–health. Patient (nervously): Maybe I should come back when you're... less contagious? Jackie, witnessing Glenn’s condition worsening, steps in. Jackie: Honey, maybe it's time to admit you need to rest. You can't help others if you're not well yourself. Glenn, realizing the truth in Jackie’s words but reluctant to give in, finally nods in agreement. [**Scene 3: RV Recovery Room**] Back in the RV, Glenn lies in bed, feeling miserable but taken care of by his family. Jackie makes chicken soup, Conor researches home remedies, and Courtney reluctantly puts down her phone to read to Glenn. Glenn (gratefully): You know, being sick isn't so bad when you have the best care team in the world. Jackie: It's just like you always say, every problem has a solution. This time, the solution was taking it easy and letting your body heal. [**Scene 4: A Lesson Learned**] A few days later, Glenn is back on his feet, feeling rejuvenated and ready to continue their road trip and his dental missions. But this time, he's learned the importance of self-care. Glenn (with newfound wisdom): From now on, I’ll make sure to take better care of myself. After all, a healthy dentist is a helpful dentist. **Narrator:** And so, the Martins learned that sometimes, slowing down isn't a sign of weakness but a necessary step towards health and happiness. Another adventure awaits, but for now, they're just enjoying being together, healthy and ready for whatever lies ahead. [**Closing Scene**] The RV drives off into the sunset, leaving the Grand Canyon behind, as the family laughs and shares stories. The screen fades to black, concluding another heartwarming and humorous episode of the Martins’ adventures. **Narrator:** Stay tuned for more tales from the road with Glenn Martin, DDS, and his incredible family. Because no matter where they are, there’s always a reason to smile.

Not birthed from orchards wide or fields kissed by sun, But found among the cobblestones, away from soil and hum. It tells a tale of nature's reach, within the city's grip, A singular piece of Eden, on an unexpected trip. It catches the eye of passersby, weary from their chase, A simple, silent offering, a momentary grace. For in its crimson depth, a reflection of simpler times, A memory of autumn days, and distant church bell chimes. The city breathes around it, alive with lights and sounds, But in its presence, a hush, a space where peace is found. It speaks of resilience, in the face of steel and stone, Of beauty that emerges, from the seeds that have been sown. Children gaze in wonder, adults pause and smile, For the apple, in its essence, transcends the urban mile. A symbol of what's constant, in a world that's always new, A reminder that within the chaos, life finds a way to bloom. So here it lies, this apple, in the city's heart so vast, A bearer of nature's message, in the present as in the past.

Our store has been selected for a grand experiment, a testament to the hard work, dedication, and exceptional customer service you all contribute to our collective success. In this new chapter, we will undergo a transformative rebranding process. The Disney Store as we know it will evolve, being renamed with a custom name that encapsulates our unique identity while continuing to celebrate the enchanting world of Disney. This change signifies an important strategic shift for Disney, with plans to transition the Disney Store branding to a digital-first approach, focusing on an online-only presence. However, I want to assure you that despite these changes, our commitment to bringing Disney's magic to life remains unchanged. Disney products will continue to be a staple in our store, ensuring that the joy, wonder, and excitement that these products bring to our customers will persist no matter what.

Have you seen the new “Kangurola” store in Fuengirola? Walked past yesterday, and I was taken aback by the pink kangaroo logo where our beloved Disney Store used to be. I mean, it's cute, but kangaroos in Spain? What's the connection? Anyone else scratching their heads over this? **User2: DisneyDreamerESP** Right?! I thought I was in the wrong place for a second. It's such a drastic change from the Disney castle logo. I get that Disney wants to try something new, but a kangaroo seems so random. I’d love to know the thought process behind this. **User3: CastMemberCarlos** Hey folks, I work at the newly named Kangurola and got some insider info. Apparently, this is just the beginning. Disney’s planning to roll out more stores globally with similarly “unique” names and logos. The idea, from what we've been told, is to create a distinctive identity for each store while still keeping the Disney magic alive through the products we sell. They want each store to stand out and spark curiosity, hence the unexpected kangaroo for Spain. **User4: DisneyHistorian** That's fascinating, Carlos! It’s a bold strategy, aiming to mix local uniqueness with global branding. This could actually turn into an interesting case study on global branding strategies. Although, the choice of a kangaroo for Spain still puzzles me. It’s neither local nor directly related to Disney’s main icons. **User5: PopCulturePundit** CastMemberCarlos, thanks for spilling the beans! This is super interesting. I’m guessing the “Kangurola” name is a playful mix of “kangaroo” and “Fuengirola”? It's certainly a conversation starter, but it has us talking, right? Maybe that's the point. Yet, I can't help but feel a bit nostalgic for the traditional Disney Store vibe. **User6: ThemeParkTheorist** Absolutely, PopCulturePundit. It’s a marketing move that catches attention and differentiates each location in a unique, albeit quirky, way. The nostalgia for the classic Disney Store is understandable, but with the retail landscape changing so rapidly, perhaps an innovative approach was necessary. Still, the effectiveness of this strategy in retaining the Disney essence while appealing to new customers remains to be seen. **User3: CastMemberCarlos** Spot on, everyone. The feedback, both positive and puzzled, is exactly what the company is looking for. It’s all about creating buzz and reinvigorating the brand in a saturated market. And yes, PopCulturePundit, you nailed the name origin! It’s meant to be fun and make people do a double-take. While we all miss the Disney Store as it was, Kangurola aims to offer a new kind of magic. Plus, the Disney products inside remain as enchanting as ever. **User7: EcoEthicist** Interesting discussion, folks! From a branding perspective, it’s bold and innovative. However, I'd be curious about the environmental ethos behind the new direction, especially concerning local wildlife and culture. Adopting a kangaroo, an animal not native or related to Spain, might be seen as overlooking local biodiversity. Would love Disney to incorporate local ecological and cultural elements into their global presence more thoughtfully. **User8: NostalgiaNerd** Change is always a bit shocking at first, especially with something as iconic as the Disney Store. But let’s give it some time. Who knows? Maybe “Kangurola” will become as beloved to us as the Disney Store once was. At least the inside still brings the Disney magic we know and love. **User2: DisneyDreamerESP** Thanks, Carlos, and everyone for your insights! It’s definitely a big shift, but understanding the strategy behind it makes a difference. I’m curious to see the other “unique” names and logos Disney comes up with around the world.

I noticed the buzz our previous conversation generated about the rebranding to “Kangurola” and wanted to dive a bit deeper into the rationale behind it, especially considering the strong reactions and curiosity it sparked. Firstly, I’d like to clarify that the decision to transition the “Disney Store” branding to an online-only presence is at the heart of this change. Disney’s strategy moving forward is to concentrate the Disney Store experience on digital platforms, making it more accessible to a broader audience globally and allowing for a more diverse and dynamic product offering. Given this shift, the rebranding of physical stores like ours to “Kangurola” represents a thoughtful divergence from the traditional store concept, allowing these spaces to maintain their charm and appeal in the face of an evolving retail landscape. The choice of distinct and memorable names for each location is a strategic move to foster a sense of novelty and curiosity around what these stores will offer, especially since they will continue to retail Disney products alongside new and exclusive lines. I can also confirm now that the store in the Miramar Shopping Centre will be embracing the “Kangurola” branding as well in the coming weeks. However, based on feedback and the lessons learned from our initial rollout, the transition there is planned to be smoother. More detailed communications and engagement activities are in the works to ensure that our loyal customers and the public are well-prepared and excited for the change. Disney is fully committed to making this transformation as seamless and positive as possible for both the customers and employees. The goal is to blend the best of both worlds: maintaining the magic and nostalgia of the Disney Store in a digital format while introducing a fresh, dynamic physical retail experience through these newly named entities. Remember, while the name on the outside is changing, the essence of what we do remains the same. Our mission to deliver joy, magic, and wonder to our customers through Disney’s beloved characters and stories continues unabated. We’re just expanding the ways in which we can share that magic. As always, I'm here to answer any questions you may have or discuss any concerns. It's an exciting time of change and growth, and your feedback is invaluable as we move forward in this journey together.

After reading @CastMemberCarlos's insights, seeing the announcement in person made the upcoming change feel all the more real. The poster itself was quite eye-catching, featuring the same vibrant pink silhouette of a kangaroo that’s now synonymous with the Fuengirola store. It seems like they’re definitely going for consistency with the branding. Interestingly, there seemed to be mixed reactions from shoppers passing by. Some looked intrigued, stopping to read the poster closely, while others appeared a bit confused, possibly wondering why a kangaroo and what’s the story behind “Kangurola.” One thing's for sure, it has caught people’s attention! I overheard a couple of kids asking their parents why the Disney Store was going to have a kangaroo, and the parents seemed just as puzzled. It sparked quite the family debate, which was amusing to witness. I’m curious to see how this transition unfolds, especially with Carlos mentioning that there’ll be a smoother transitional period for Miramar compared to the Fuengirola store. Will there be more announcements or events leading up to the change? How will the community react once the transformation is complete? And most importantly, what unique products or experiences will “Kangurola” offer that keeps the Disney magic alive for both kids and adults? It feels like we’re on the brink of a new era for Disney’s physical retail presence. I’m hopeful, yet cautiously optimistic, about this blend of nostalgia and innovation.

Have you all caught wind of the latest theme rolling out throughout NYC? It seems like the city is gearing up for a massive Uncle Sam theme. From what I've gathered, several landmarks and public spaces are getting a patriotic makeover, complete with red, white, and blue decorations and a plethora of Uncle Sam imagery. It's certainly an interesting choice, aiming to invoke a sense of national pride and perhaps bring some unity. Thoughts? **User2: UrbanExplorerNYC** Yes, I saw some installations going up at Times Square yesterday! Huge Uncle Sam hats are everywhere, and I even spotted some interactive Uncle Sam \\"I Want YOU\\" photo booths. It's an ambitious theme for sure. It's creating a buzz among tourists already, but I'm curious how locals are feeling about it. It's a bit kitschy, maybe? **User3: ArtLover123** Interesting concept! It sparks a conversation about how art and historical figures are used in public spaces. Uncle Sam is such an iconic symbol of American patriotism. It's kind of refreshing to see the city embracing it in a fun and engaging way, mixing history with modern interactive elements. Hopefully, this can also serve as an educational tool for younger generations. **User4: NYPatriot** Absolutely love this! 🇺🇸 There's something special about walking through the city and feeling that strong sense of American pride. With everything going on in the world, a little unity and patriotism go a long way. Plus, it's about time we had some positivity and celebration of our country's symbols. Can't wait to see all the decorations at full swing. **User5: TheSkepticalNewYorker** While I appreciate the effort to bring some unity and promote patriotism, I hope the city also remains mindful of its diverse population and ensures that this theme is inclusive. New York City is a melting pot of cultures, and our public displays should celebrate that diversity too. It's important to strike the right balance. **User6: EventPlannerNY** This Uncle Sam theme is creating some unique opportunities for events around the city. I hear there are going to be several parades, historical talks, and even a scavenger hunt related to NYC’s role in American history. It has the potential to bring a lot of business to local venues and educate people about the city's and the country's heritage in a fun way. Curious to see how it'll all turn out! **User7: BrooklynBeat** Saw a group of kids taking pictures with an Uncle Sam impersonator down in Coney Island. They seemed to love it! I think as long as it's done tastefully and with a sense of fun, it can be a great summer theme. Plus, it's been a while since we've had a city-wide theme that brought everyone together.

For these were mere moments of respite in the lives of a twink Gondorian soldier named Caelum and his burly Rohirric horseman friend, Eofor. The weary battles and endless marches had taken their toll on Caelum, his usually vibrant eyes dulled under the weight of war. Observing his friend's plight, Eofor, with his boisterous laughter that seemed to echo the very essence of the Riddermark, proposed a solution most unconventional. \\"Let us find solace in the embrace of nature, my friend! A spot of skinnydipping shall wash away our woes!\\" Eofor declared, his grand gestures unsettling a nearby squirrel. The notion was met with an uncertain, yet intrigued look from Caelum, but the promise of ephemeral liberation from their burdens swayed him to acquiesce. Upon discovering a secluded pond, framed by the caress of willow trees, they proceeded to undress. Caelum, slender and refined with skin like polished ivory, revealed a form sculpted by the discipline of Gondorian training — less in bulk, but graceful. His counterpart, Eofor, cut a figure robust and brawny, skin weathered like leather from countless days under the Rohan sun, his body a testament to the ruggedness of the Rohirric life. The comparison was lighthearted; Eofor's hair was like a wild mane of golden wheat, whereas Caelum's was a cascade of raven silk, meticulously kept. As they waded into the crystalline waters, they marveled silently at their contrasting physiques — Eofor's broad, powerful back and ample rear compared to Caelum's lean, agile frame and modest curves. The pond, a mirror to their camaraderie, held their reflections in a poignant dance of light and shadow. \\"So, you're going to wash my back, then?\\" Eofor joked, bringing Caelum from his reverie to the task at hand. The pair laughed; the sound mingled with the rustling leaves. With a mild blush adorning his cheeks, Caelum agreed, and as he gently scrubbed, they conversed about trivial matters, words light as the foam on the water. The serenity of the moment, however, was shattered as Eofor, overcome by relaxation (and perhaps the seismic shift of laughter in his belly), released a fart so potent, it seemed to roil the very pond around them. Caelum recoiled in dramatic horror, sputtering and coughing, \\"By the Valar, Eofor! What do you feed that beast?\\" Eofor, for a moment, seemed as a statue, mortified, before he erupted into a litany of apologies laced with laughter. \\"I swear it's the salted pork! It wages war upon my innards fiercer than any orc!\\" Beneath the water, several unfortunate fish succumbed to the ambush, floating lifelessly to the surface. Observing this, and after the air cleared (quite literally), Eofor's embarrassment segued into opportunistic mischief. \\"Nature provides, eh? How about we feast upon these gifts?\\" Eofor suggested, his eyes twinkling with a mix of hunger and continued amusement. And so, they collected the fish, their former ordeal forgotten amidst the crackle of flames and the aroma of roasted fare. As they ate, they exchanged stories and jests, their laughter a balm to the scars of war. \\"Next time, let's just stick to bathing, maybe with a considerable distance between us, hmm?\\" Caelum jested, nudging Eofor lightly with his elbow. \\"Aye, a bath for the ages it was. Who knew my... talents could provide such bounty?\\" Eofor chuckled, biting into the last of their meal. Underneath the canopy of stars, two friends from worlds apart found common ground, not in their battles, but in the laughter and unexpected turns of a day meant for respite. They lay back, their troubles momentarily forgotten, basking in the warmth of friendship and the peculiar tale of skinny dipping that would, for years to come, be a source of endless amusement and camaraderie."},{"instruction":"definition of name tom","output":"The name Tom is a short form of the name Thomas, which means \\"twin\\" in Aramaic.

One summer evening, as the sun dipped low, painting the skies in hues of fire and whispering to the weary that the time for rest was nigh, Baldor noticed the crease of worry etched deeply between Ecthelion's brows. It was as if the shadows of Mordor themselves had laid a cold hand upon his friend's heart, sowing seeds of unease that even the most valiant of Gondor's soldiers could not easily fend off. \\"Come, my friend,\\" Baldor boomed, his voice a warm cloak against the chill of apprehension. \\"Let us wash away the cares of the world in yonder pond. I hear the waters of Rohan have magic enough to lighten even the darkest of spirits.\\" Though hesitant at first, Ecthelion's lips curved into a smile, a gentle nod sealing their adventurous pact. As they approached the hidden pond, nestled like a jewel in the embrace of the land, they shed their armors and garments, a pile of metal and cloth left behind like the skins of their former selves. It was then, in the tender light of dusk, that their differences became all the more evident: Ecthelion, with his slender frame, smooth as the marble halls of Minas Tirith, and Baldor, whose broad, muscled back and thick thighs spoke of many a day spent taming the wildest horses of the Mark. Their derrières, too, could not have been more different — Ecthelion's, pert and defined, the archetype of elven grace; Baldor's, mightier and rounder, a testament to his strength and steadfastness. Stepping into the pond, the cool embrace of water closed around them, sending ripples of laughter across its surface as they settled into their aquatic refuge. There, in that moment of vulnerability, they found solace in each other's company. \\"Ecthelion, my friend, would you do me the honor?\\" Baldor asked, presenting his back with a cheeky grin. With careful hands, Ecthelion began the task, the motion of his fingers through the water and across his friend's back, and yes, even his buttock, more akin to a dance than a chore. \\"Only you would convince me to partake in such madness,\\" Ecthelion chided, though his voice was light, tinged with mirth. 'Twas in the midst of this camaraderie that the unexpected happened — a sound, thunderous and sudden, erupted from Baldor, sending shockwaves throughout the tranquil pond. For a moment, all was still, save for the dying echo of the deed. Baldor, face turning a shade of red that would rival even the cloaks of his homeland, muttered, \\"Well, I did say I wanted to lighten the mood.\\" Ecthelion, caught between horror and hilarity, could not contain the laughter that bubbled forth, a crystal-clear sound that filled the evening air. \\"Truly, you have a gift, my friend,\\" he managed between gasps. The pond, a witness to their folly, offered up its casualties — a few unfortunate fish that had succumbed to the noxious surprise. With mischief in their eyes, the friends collected the fallen, and by the fire’s crackling embrace, they roasted their unexpected bounty. As the flames danced and flickered, casting shadows that mingled with the night, Baldor broke the silence. \\"I suppose this makes me a warrior of sorts, slaying foes with but a single blow.\\" Ecthelion, shaking his head in bemusement, couldn't resist. \\"Aye, and let it be known across the lands: Never challenge a man of Rohan to a battle of winds, for surely, you will be vanquished.\\" Their laughter, warm and unfettered, joined the chorus of the night, a melody of friendship that would echo through the ages, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, joy could be found in the most unlikely of places."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a twink Gondorian soldier and a burly Rohirric horseman hanging out.

Beredhir, a slender and agile Gondorian soldier with a cheeky grin, sported a mop of unruly dark hair that always seemed to fall perfectly across his brow, no matter the chaos of battle. His companion, Eofor, was the embodiment of Rohirric strength; his wide shoulders and muscular frame were as much a testament to his heritage as the long, flowing blonde hair that cascaded down his back. \\"Come now, Beredhir,\\" Eofor laughed, clapping a broad, calloused hand onto the smaller man's shoulder. \\"You look like you could use some lightening of spirits. What say you to a spot of skinny dipping?\\" Beredhir's eyes twinkled with amusement. \\"Lead the way, my mountainous friend. I could surely use a distraction from the darkness of these times.\\" They stumbled upon a secluded, crystal-clear pond, its surface undisturbed and inviting. With a mix of bravado and modesty, they undressed, their laughter echoing through the trees. Beredhir, slender and lithe, revealed a physique honed by years of military discipline; his skin was smooth and pale, in stark contrast to Eofor's tanned and hairy body, testament to days spent under the open sky. As they stood there, they couldn't help but engage in a playful comparison of their buttocks, with Beredhir jokingly lamenting his lack of Rohirric robustness, while Eofor commended his friend's tidy, athletic form. Slipping into the cool water, they let out simultaneous sighs of relief. The gulf between their worlds seemed to vanish amidst the gentle lap of water around them. Beredhir, ever the caring soul, took it upon himself to help wash Eofor's back, his slender fingers working through the warrior's knots and tangles, eliciting a deep and contented sigh from the horseman. \\"It's times like these,\\" Eofor mused, \\"that I'm reminded of the simpler joys in life—friends, water, and the peace of nature.\\" Beredhir hummed in agreement, circling around to address the broader expanse of his friend's back, and, with a daring smirk, ventured lower to give the horseman's substantial rear a thorough scrub. It was then, in that moment of relaxed vulnerability, that Eofor let out a surprisingly pungent fart, disrupting the serenity of their aquatic idyll. The water around them seemed to roil and bubble with the force of it, and for a split second, time stood still. Beredhir's eyes widened in mock horror, and after a beat of stunned silence, both men erupted into fits of hysterical laughter that seemed to shake the very leaves from the trees. \\"By the Valar, Eofor! Did you mean to poison the waters of this sacred grove?\\" Beredhir managed between chortles. \\"My apologies, my friend,\\" Eofor gasped, trying to regain his composure. \\"I suppose even the mighty riders of Rohan can be felled by their own... uh, emissions.\\" As their laughter subsided into gentle chuckles, they noticed several fish floating lifelessly to the surface, victims of the noxious intrusion. An idea sparked in Beredhir's mischievous mind, and soon, they found themselves roasting the unfortunate fish over a hastily made fire, the folly of the situation only enhancing the flavor. \\"This, Eofor, will surely be a tale for the ages,\\" Beredhir quipped as they enjoyed their unexpected feast. \\"The day the mighty Rohirric behind slew more than just the enemies of Gondor.\\" Eofor shook his head, a grin splitting his face. \\"Let it be known then, that even in the darkest of times, friendship—and a well-timed fart—can light the way to memorable adventures.\\" Under the stars, with bellies full and spirits lifted, the warrior and the soldier knew they had found a story that would echo in the halls of their people, a reminder that joy could be found in the simplest of moments and the most unlikely of friendships."},{"instruction":"make a vividly detailed Lord of the Rings comedic story about two friends, a twink Gondorian soldier and a burly Rohirric horseman hanging out.

Bain hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement. They hurriedly undressed, revealing their contrasting butts and physiques. Eadric's muscular frame was in stark contrast to Bain's slim and toned one, and their hair – Eadric's rugged and unkempt, Bain's long and flowing – only added to their unique appearances. As they entered the pond, the cool water refreshing against their skin, they began chatting like old friends. Bain even offered to wash Eadric's back and butt, much to Eadric's amusement.

agents are so polarizing people are either afraid of them they believe that they're going to be replaced by them or they believe that they're going to become rich charity I cannot even use anymore like that's how bad it it has got what's the biggest problem with not just agents but large language models people don't trust them Sam Alman is trying to regulate open source no it's not the best look when you start a company named open Ai and then somehow it becomes a for-profit and it's closed Source I believe that AI is too important to be left to just like researchers you know and people that are sitting in on high positions we we all need to be involved and we all need to give feedback this is an interview with Maya Akim AI content creator and Asian Builder Maya is completely self-taught a year ago she was a beginner when it comes to Python and AI agents and now she's building complex agent teams and even inventing her own workflows so if you are new to agents and want to learn more about them make sure to watch Until the End how did you get into building agents I guess it was like um hype around the time when Auto GPT was published I think that everyone on Twitter was talking about how they just buil the website and of course I I also wanted to automate some of the stuff and I tried and I failed all of my videos before Auto GPT video were getting like 100 views and those were mostly my family members that I forced to watch but this video was like the first video that people like really wanted to watch and and I was shocked I remember at the time I had like 10,000 views and I was like oh my God like it was a video about how I tried to build a website with autog jpt and it was looping a lot so that's how I got into AI agents and for a really long time I had like a negative opinion about them because of aut GPT like one important detail is that the first agent team you've built like actually failed and you know so many people have this experience and but like the next step is that they give up and they don't like build anything else but you didn't do that you actually kept building agents so what was the like first team that actually clicked for you to be honest my first question was like what what can I use this for like what what exactly can I automate because a lot of the examples on Twitter Were Somehow useless for me I guess I realized very quickly that I can process like a lot of information with agents because I guess that's what llms are for I think that the First theme of agents that I built that was successful was crew aai and I made a video about it it um and I managed to like um kind of extract some information about AI Trends and um what people are talking about uh thanks to crew AI yeah so if someone wants to get into agents would you recommend them crew AI or a different framework by the way if you want to get serious about building agents and be part of the future then definitely check out my workshop on how to build and deploy AI agents it's available inside of my community where you'll also get access to people on The Cutting Edge of AI if that sounds inter interesting to you make sure to join it's the first link in the description ooh it's a good one uh I think it depends I know that crei currently doesn't have like any interface so if you just know how to do things around terminal I guess uh maybe autog gen Studio would be better and yesterday I was actually testing DEA that's what I think that's how it's pronounced and it's supposed to like um be a copy of Devon and it has like a graphic interface so if you're non programmer then I would recommend Auto gen studio and DEA and uh if you are a programmer then yeah I would recommend crew AI probably yeah I mean personally I'm not afraid of you know writing some code but I know that for people like you know even the basic programming can be intimidating but what I found is that actually the autogen studio setup is almost more difficult than you know code so it's true I agree yeah know that's another problem a lot of these um AI agent ideas whatever are people are building stuff and they say that there are for non-programmers and then I make a video about it and I'm like no code agent framework and then people in the comments comment after me they're like well but you you still need to do programming I'm like no it's the terminal it's not programming but I I understand why they might think so so yeah anytime I also mention like even known programmers can do this I get so many comments and like what I tried to do is I said I tried like telling people like if you get stuck just please use cgbd you will get unstuck but so many people still underestimate the power of the current llms and like I get so many comments that are literally just if I just copy paste them into cgbd I get the answer but it's I don't know it feels like it's not natural for people to ask llms for the answer yeah because I think that we still didn't develop this habit I I myself for example don't use Google anymore ever I don't know about you but like I I feel so uh inefficient when I try to find answers on Google so uh usually when I have some technical problem I used to um try Chad GPT um but now I prefer Claud um I actually have like a sub subscription and I just prefer the way that the chat bot sounds um and uh if I have like some research to do then I do perplexity because um it has a really nice internet browsing feature so yeah I mean I use Google for images because I think that's still like the best way but yeah for like if I need to do research then I do usually a combination of perplexity where I have the LM set up to CLA free and then Gemini from Google is also pretty good and I mean I'm in Europe so cl. a is not available so what I have to do is I I have to go to the anthropic console for developers and use it there I mean it's fine but you know it's still a bit more friction but at least I don't pay subscription I pay for the API usage I you know consume for the tokens I use so that's good oh that's that's good you can also I I'm pretty sure because U mistol is a French company I I think that they have chat uh I I don't know how to pronounce it but like I think that that that is also a good chat bot so you can use that in Europe I'm pretty sure do you think like Mr Large should be considered a state-ofthe-art like do you think it's up there with gbd4 turbo and cl 3 Opus yeah I think so yeah you know um one thing I have to say is that uh so far um mistel has like the best open-source 7 billion parameter model and uh there's this giant uh hype around um model blending and people seem to uh kind of improve mistel by blending it with other models and I I think that um that company is we're going to see great things from them I really love everything that they're doing so I I just yeah I'm a huge fan what can I say yeah I mean it's crazy like they're like what 9 months old or something like that it's it's such a new company and they've already released models that are coming for open Ai and Google so like just if you compare the amount of resources they have compared to these Tech Giants it's it's crazy right exactly like it get like like a mistal 7 billion uh parameter like that model like it's just so much better than any other model that we have it's open source even like bigger models like llama with 70 billion perameters I I I when I use a Mell 7 billion like I just I see that it's a better model somehow I I enjoy it more yeah although like llama 3 is you know in development so we'll see maybe yeah maybe Zak can cook something up and I mean if llama 3 is better than gbd4 that would be insane yeah but it's it you see Google has like unlimited resources and they they still really struggle so it's not a guarantee uh but we'll see I guess you're right I'm also excited about llama 3 all right do you want to go into the presentation uh sounds good sounds good well I guess I just made this uh tiny presentation just in order to like cover some of the basics because I I feel like a lot of people don't really understand on a deeper level what an agent is and I think that I also didn't understand which I think made me quite confused and it made me either overestimate or underes imate agents in like a broadest sense an agent is like an entity with capacity to act um it's as simple as that and like a human we can say is an is an agent that's like a single program agent or an animal that acts like autonomously like a cat asking for a treat or as we can see a machine right uh with these AI agents and now what does it mean to act because I think that a lot of people kind of just because we do it every day we don't really think consciously about it and we don't really care about what it really implies kind of like this this question of what it means to act was something that was obsessing people for thousands of years because Aristotle actually in like 350 uh before Christ year before Christ was like we deliberate not about ANS but about means what Aristotle is kind of trying to say is that you don't really like a goal on its own is like a a fixed think you you know you you are here and you want to become a Hollywood star you have this goal and you don't really necessarily have a lot of say in it you you you you the Heart Wants What It Wants right so like this road between like where you are and when you want to become where you want to be is a road of actions right it it consists of some tinier tasks some tinier goals yeah and this is pretty much what Aristotle was like obsessed with he also had some weird beliefs like he believed that men had have more teeth and whoever has more teeth is going to live longer but at least when it comes to this he was like a Pioneer he was the first person that we know that thought about what it means to act then you have a Ramon l in the 13th century and these wheels uh are something that you can see even on YouTube I was kind of super surprised um a lot of people think that ramun was like a like a father of computer science and Theory because uh these wheels on the right they're like a first time that you know Humanity had some sort of like a logical operations um he was trying to uh find the truth about life that that's like absolute truth and he was kind of like making these tiny algorithms that that could bring him to truth then you have a blae pascal who made the mechanical calculator that uh a lot of people claim is the first computer um and it was it could only do like additions and subtractions and I think that uh Pascal's father used it for taxes and that was pretty much it and it was forgotten afterwards I think that they struggled to produce it uh in larger quantities uh and then a jump to 19th century and uh ad la la um who made this note G which many kind of consider to be a first algorithm ever and um she even uh said that it's like a thinking or reasoning machine so as you can see it's like 2,000 years of like this idea slowly building and then you get to the 1950s and Allen Turing who you know people considered to be a father of computer science um he had this research paper paper a computer Computing machinery and intelligence and one of the first things that this research paper sayses can machines think and uh Alan touring had a lot of uh people that were skeptical they believe that it's impossible at the time and that's why he devised this imitation game uh that's supposed to sort of like convince people that machines can indeed sound like they're thinking or they can think and it became a touring test eventually then six years later you have Darth darthmouth conference where the term AI gets mentioned for the first time and these are the founding fathers of AI um and I I kind of thought that this is really funny they wrote like a tiny manifest and they said that we propos a TW month 10 men study of artificial intelligence in order to try to make machines use language form abstractions and solve problems that only humans can so they believe that in two months they can achieve what essentially AI is still trying to do which I think is kind of like hilar hilariously uh giant number of giant amount of optimism and John McCarthy was one of the founding F fathers thanks to him we have um not just thanks of him there were other people but he kind of like pioneered this program called myy c i n um and it it's a it was a type of a knowledge-based system or a symbolic AI um that had its like moment in the 50s and 60s and' 7s uh and it was um kind of like the culmination of everything that I talked about before from Aristotle till onwards because at the time people believed that AI has to arise from this rational thinking you know for example if if you want to get to the airport again um with these symbolic AI you know you would have a bunch of rules like uh you have to get into the elevator then you have to call an Uber then you have to drive for 15 minutes and then you have to then that means that you got to the airport right so it's some sort of like um if statements like if this is true then this and then if that's true then that and that's pretty much what um what the the first AI was about the symbolic Ai and um people discovered that it's a kind of a problematic uh approach because it worked fine for that program that I mentioned uh myy c n uh that that was people at the time used it doctors used it to diagnose patients and it had around 60 600 rules um and it indeed could like diagnose interpret um some sort of like lab results and stuff but the problem is that um if you ask that symbolic AI like like a chat bot that's built on top of symbolic AI how long will it take you to get to cerin and cerin is a Galaxy that I invented um it doesn't exist well it's going to start from the beginning it's going to be like first statement are you in the car or whatever it is that you know you however you built it and the problem with a symbolic AI is that um well first of all there's a lot of uncertainty in the world uh if you try to build an AI system to help you get to the airport uh and it has some sort of fixed rules like symbolic AI like how is it going to take into consideration that it might be like there might be like a traffic jam somewhere right or a strike or things like that then there's ignorance for example the Galaxy that I just get invented it doesn't exist but symbolic I wouldn't have uh a single clue that it doesn't exist it would just go on about you know it it will start all over again then complexity uh world is incredibly messy and comp complicated and it just doesn't work well for these rational symbolic AI systems so what what is the solution uh well at the time when uh people were building these symbolic AI systems um that's when the first AI winter started because uh the systems were really limited and it lasted for a few decades but while the funding kind of like stopped and the research seemed to die uh in the background um the field of AI went to in a totally unexpected uh uh Direction it went into probabilistic and statistics and um this is where we are right now we have uh these uh networks um we have next token predictions without going into details um we can we can say that right now this is pretty much the the main approach in AI what seems to be like a thinking machine a thinking chpt is just uh basically constantly predicting the next token that makes the most sense there was the change of Paradigm in the in the' 70s it's the rise of deep learning uh with a bunch of layers um and the rise of reinforcement learning where we kind of see for the first time um you know this idea that there is an agent and there's an environment in which the agent exists and then based on what it does it gets rewarded or it gets punished for what it does it's quite a shift from those first uh sort of like let's call them AI agents that were just following a bunch of rules and you know uh the open AI had uh they pioneered these uh gym Atari environments in 2016 I believe uh where um AI agents can like learn from these cute little environments I don't think it's available anymore you cannot really use it um so here's what I noticed um before the 80s you could say that you know the idea was that agent is an entity with the capacity to act and it's in it's intelligent to the extent that its action can be expected to achieve its goals and here I added in Brackets our goals because ideally um we would put goals into machines and not the other way around y but after the80s um with this Paradigm Shift you know it became like agents became more complicated and you know you could say that their act that they're intelligent to the extent that their actions can be expected to achieve goals given what they have perceived in the environment and this is kind of where we are right now um if you think about an AI agent it should be able to act autonomously ideally with a human the loop uh as a way to control uh and and kind of guide uh an agent um ideally it should have memory because uh memory allows agents to have a to to display some sort of like personalized Behavior so you can have your old personal agent that like has to made for you it should be reactive uh it should perceive things in its environment uh whether it's like text or audio or visual input and you should be able to be proactive and we see this very often uh agents have tools now they can make API calls they can do function calling um which makes them smarter and they should also have social ability which is the ability to kind of like keep the flow to delegate and and so on and uh now this is the part that I kind of this is how I started the presentation and this is the question that I had in my mind as I was thinking about agents like what is it that an agent can do that a human cannot do and I think that steuart Russell who's a computer scientist kind of answered this question perfectly in his book a human compatible he said that uh Speech and text understanding also enable machines to do things that no other human can do not because of the depth of of understanding but because of its scale and I believe that this is the core um this is what agents can do that humans cannot do the scale for example uh you can have an agent scrape a bunch of information from Reddit from YouTube from your Gmail whatever you want and then you can ask it to summarize it and to like to give you an output that's like news letter or summarize and write an email and so on these things would take you forever for example if you take that an average um speed of reading is 200 to 300 words per minute like you would need you if and an average uh YouTube video last for like 20 minutes you could have uh an agent analyze 10 YouTube videos and and write it like a summary with in a minute whereas you know it would take you hours or uh another great use case is imagine your life in next five years right if you ask yourself this you you're probably going to like imagine few possible scenarios with a tiny bit of details like oh you know well I guess I want to graduate guess I want to move to a country or maybe I want go to university maybe I'll get married or whatever right it's like few details and few possible paths whereas an agent could brainstorm uh something like this for you without a problem and it could give you a lot of details and a lot of interesting ideas so this is like chess basically where like a human Grandmaster can only think like 20 moves ahead and you have a stock fish that can brainstorm like thousand of different moves exactly yeah exactly uh and this is what agents can do that uh because an agent is built on top of llm right um that that humans just cannot do we we cannot compete with them but they can when when you know this is the now now the next question like what is it that an agent can do that a single large language model cannot do right and um I believe that the one of the main thing is that it's it's accuracy is improved be because it goes through a couple of iterations it can fact check and it can um U that can bring to they can bring less hallucinations and lead to improved accuracy and uh actually uh that video that you published about AI agents uh Andrew I believe talks about this he did a research where which he uh you know kind of like proved that uh GPT 3.5 is way more accurate it's like 96% more uh of the time accurate compared to like zero shot gp4 yeah that's crazy like people people don't realize what that means it's like you can take a worse llm and with the power of Agents you can make it better than a much more advanced llm exactly yeah that's the thing uh right like a zero shot prompting is what we all do like I I do it all the time I know that I ideally should use a like a crew of Agents but it's still easier for me to like type something in uh in a chat boot but if you think about it like you can have like a GPT 3.5 is not impressive anymore and it can be look how accurate it can be just this is the quote that I got from that um video that you that you shared and another thing that I think that um agents do that a single LM canot do is offload decision making and priority prioritization so if you have some sort of a request like create AR Trend overview right you don't have to think about how are you going to accomplish this goal goal um agent is going to write some smaller tasks like uh you know I need to take these steps and we even see it as we like play with AI agents we see whether it's in the terminal or whatever that they kind of like brainstorm about the your request and they think about what needs to be done and then they're going to like see which task has the highest priority and this is a very important step I I personally hate you know making these list of what needs to be done um and I have this decision fatigue and the fact that I have these agents that can kind of like collaborate together and do this for me is a huge help for me and of course AI agents are not AGI like people shouldn't expect that of them I have to say I did not expect it to start with Aristotle but I love it yeah sorry I I might have gotten carried away because I wanted to build this like rationality and how it led to you know everything else so but it's fascinating like you see like people thought that AGI is just you know few months away even 70 years ago or something and also like another thing that people don't realize is that the field of AI is much older than you know the average person thinks like just because people didn't hear about AI before CH gbd doesn't mean nobody was working on it like the history goes back to like alen touring and even before touring so yeah it's it's crazy but like that's the argument why some people think that AI is still decades away because you know 70 years ago people are thinking it's right around the corner but I think you know obviously right now we have the best claim uh that it's actually closer well that's yeah that's actually there I looked at the timeline of all the smart people that were wrong about AGI and the the you know it's like you have all these scientists and researchers and they claim that you know oh you know we're going to have AGI in uh two years or something something and the problem is that there are still a lot of scientific breakthroughs that need to happen in order for this to really happen and it's impossible to predict when you know certain break breakthrough is going to happen so you know that that's why that's why it's so hard yeah and one more thing I would add is that when you had like what uh agents are like why agents are better than normal llms I think tool usage is one of the things that people don't realize is that you know sure in chbt it has some tools like code interpr or gbtv but with agents you can have like dedicated agent that has access to only one tool and then the manager can call him or like you can do like much more tools I've like I've seen your video you had like 20 different Tools in autogen that you've built so like with agents you can give them access to every single API that open AI will probably not Implement into C GPT right so yeah that's the thing uh you can always um kind of build your own agent um depending on what you need right you can add custom tools that's great I I believe that eventually like everything that we have right now uh that is an app is going to become a sort of a tool for an agent uh if you think about it like I think this is what happened with those um CH gbt plugins they were essentially if you think about it apps right um unfortunately it didn't take off I think that it's still a little bit too soon but yeah I I I strongly believe that this is you know that that's the direction yeah I mean it there cannot be any like friction cuz if somebody has to go manually and search for a GPT that's too much I think it has to be like somebody's chatting inside of C GPT and then the llm automatically sees like oh there is this top rated GPT that does exactly this and it pulls it in and the user doesn't have to do anything because you know the average user will not go to the GPT Store and search up for something specific for example if I am looking for some sort of a python like library to to do something um I really I I I honestly feel this way like I would rather uh let chpt recommend something to me then like Google what U what type of a python libraries exist out there and then you know I have to scroll through lists of a lot of libraries and they all kind of look the similar I I want chpt to recommend even if it's a wrong Library if it's not the best I'd rather have that than a perfect Li library but I have to like spend two hours searching for it on on Google but of course you know as you as you as you work and and you need uh you know you need the good tools eventually maybe you have to Google and find the right library but at least initially this is like my lazy brain thinks this way but like this will get really crazy once we have llms with like endless token I mean context windows that you know they can just get like five million tokens and also it's like something where it's observing your screen at all times so it knows all the context as you do let's say you do like some complicated you know coding project then you don't have to describe every everything into the llm it just knows like you have one agent watching your screen One agent that you know is an expert in libraries or whatever and then like all you have to do is like literally just ask it for the library or well like either a library or just to solve the problem right away and then it just does that because you know it's been watching your screen it knows entire code it knows everything about python all the latest updates so like I think that's like coming very soon yeah that's the thing uh this the guy that I mentioned St Russell he in his book human compatible he says that agent is a stream it's it's literally a process that constantly takes input and output something based on whatever it is that you you give it right there so it's a process and um you know uh I I can't wait to to see how agents become personalized because for example right now uh a giant obstacle that I have is that sometimes when I use um croi I I kind of have to start from the beginning or I have to like tweak things a little bit and I I feel like it's a waste of time ideally uh I would have like a personal uh croi and I saw that um um there is some sort of like a shortterm or long-term memory added I still didn't have time to check it out but I really feel excited about it like I can't way to see how how personalized agents can get yeah and this will also be huge for like medicine right because even like your doctor doesn't know everything like all your childhood injuries or whatever you can just have that in like a text document or whatever and have a agent that knows everything and either you know it just solves the issue right away or it sends that brief to a human doctor that is like okay you know if your elbow hurts there's everything that might be relevant and like leaves out stuff that's not relevant yeah because uh exactly or if you think about um for example decisions that you make you want an agent to uh make the best decision for you right um am I always great at making great decision for myself no like I I think I had a lot of chocolate recently ideally I I would kind of like stop it but I need someone else to tell me that it's bad for me right and and an agent would be able to like kind of create this memory and and and kind of this you know offload of decision making it's such giant help and the fact that they can do it autonomously like that's just amazing a lot of people would instantly like put the argument that you know you lose the freedom obviously you can still choose what the agent will do and like what it optimizes for but to a lot of people this is like kind of troubling Outsourcing part of your thinking or like your decision- making to an agent right yeah it is it is deeply problematic and uh it seems like nobody has a solution right now a lot of people work on this like alignment uh what was the name of that King right that you know the story the ancient Greek story where a king wants everything that he touches to turn to gold and then it ends up happening and then he slowly starves to death because even when he tries to eat like an apple is turned to gold and whoever he touches dies and things like that because they also turned to Gold so that's that's another problem when you get what you want right which uh it's it's kind of hard to we also are not that great at understanding our own intentions and our own desires and then once you Outsource it to someone else it can lead to like that someone else is like a a machine that doesn't know a lot about humans that's kind of problematic yeah I think this is like you know comes down to your understanding because people that fear this usually have no understanding of llms or agents and how they work like that's what I've seen with like Claud you know it's it's the people who had like no knowledge of the technical side that would like oh my God it's sentient it can think it's like I'm like chill out and then like yeah I don't know I personally I would definitely give out um like I would definitely pay for an agent that could like sort my task know all of my goals but the thing is like people don't realize how much context is necessary right because for us it's natural because we live our entire life and it's all stored in our head but we don't realize how many points of context that is how many like visual images text audio we heard all of that is in our head and we don't like consciously see that when we make a decision but it all like plays a role right with an agent you have to give it that information so like that's when like context windows are huge because you can have an agent that literally knows everything about you about your short-term goals long-term goals the current troubles you're facing whatever and then you tell it okay create a priority list today and you know it already knows your goals it already knows what you have to do next week it knows your calendar everything and then you just have the priority list and you just work and I think like that would be huge that would just unlock so much productivity cuz like all of us have been there where we make like a daily task of things and then we go off it and we just like never return right but if we have a agent that constantly updates it and like especially with some like VR technology where you like see the task that you have to do always I think that would be like a massive productivity boost yeah yeah that's that's that's true I agree my only concern is that um um this you you mentioned right um Windows context right uh window context right it it's it's a it's it's a problem right now but um it's slowly being resolved but then um you know how our memories are not perfect and not everything is equally important to us so what what are things that an agent is going to pay attention to you know it might um misjudge what actually matters to us because um you know uh we our memory is so flaw that we remember usually just highs and lows we don't remember like the ordinary grind so to say uh and that is something that uh kind of is also a concern but I yeah I agree I would love to have um my own personal agent that um can remind me of things that I maybe forgot or can decide maybe like this can decide for me and then I can say yes or no I can in the end I'm the one who's in control right that's that's like that's such a great idea yeah I think people like jump to the conclusion that like oh my God I don't want the agent to be sending emails or like paying bills and like okay that's maybe like the future future for the present like the next step is just an agent being capable of that the step after that is like you still approve like the most significant actions right it's not going to be like you have an agent that just deletes programs from your PC or like you know removes a Google account like that's not going to happen there will be like checks for the actions that are high risk that you have to human approve right so like I'm not worried about that but like I don't know I I think for what you had like the worry like what the agent might optimize for I think that could be solved if like every day you the agent like prompts you five different questions of like let's say you have it creates a task list or whatever and you like why is this so high right you click it like it should be lower and the agent asks why do you think let's say you know I don't know working on your business is higher than I don't know going to the gym random stuff right and then you explain like well okay I'm already in a great shape but you know my business is struggling so like you just give it the extra cont text and I think if you if you do that like enough days in a row where you just like ask it asks you five questions relevant to your priorities and what you want and you answer that and you do that for a few months I think it will be like just like perfectly aligned you know that's the thing it's going to learn your preferences because and then as you go through life your preferences change and it's going to be able to adapt to that as well right like What mattered to you 20 years ago is not the same as now right so yeah I agree like um if if it knows our preferences it's going to be so useful to us um yeah and you mentioned something interesting you mentioned that people are afraid of Agents you said you know that the people are afraid that they're going to delete the wrong thing or things like that and I think that fear is a giant uh part of um AI agents I don't know if you noticed that um you know when a company like openi publishes a new model or something it's it's a giant news but it's not not that polarizing people are mostly excited about it they use it they test it and that's it but AI agents are so polarizing people are either afraid of them they believe that they're going to be replaced by them or or they believe that they're going to become rich thanks to a agents like it's like incredible how different these two groups are but um yeah fear is a giant problem uh and uh I think it comes from like misunderstanding more than anything but also a lot of problems are unresolved how do you teach an agent like what your preferences are you know I have a I I believe that like AI researchers have a lot to figure out yeah and for something like that where it you know makes decisions and suggests what you should do I think that absolutely needs to be open source because we cannot like there cannot be any bias from a closed Source company like you don't know what it's pushing you towards right if it's like obviously if it's extreme like Gemini creating like refusing created white people then yeah people will notice that but if it's subtle and like over years it's pushing you to like you know I don't know maybe it's like vegan and like don't admit or like I don't know just pushing you to a certain political party slowly and slowly you don't notice that but like you know it's not in your best interest it's in the interest who made the AI so for that I think like an agent that makes your decision or like makes your priority list and does stuff that's like so intimidate and personal I think that has to be open source exactly you know um that's the reason why I kind of started my AI Channel even even though I'm not a machine learning expert I believe that AI is too important to be left to just like researchers you know and people that are sitting in uh on high positions we we all need to be involved and we all need to give feedback um and um you know I wanted to ask you you you mentioned open source now do you believe in all these like I don't know if they're conspiracy theories or not that like Sam Alman is trying to regulate open source so that you know he has a better he's lobbying for open Ai and he's trying to like kind of reduce the importance of Open Source I I feel like that tier is being thrown around a lot lately I mean I think it started when he went to Congress right I don't know if you've seen that but like he was pushing for regulation and it's not the best look when you start a company named open Ai and it's a nonprofit and then somehow it becomes a for-profit and it's closed source and then you go to Congress and you start like telling them how dangerous it is if everybody has access to this technology it's like okay but why you Sam right like you know why should you and like a handful of other people be controlling the single most important technology of all time and like yeah you know I don't know I feel like that's so so sketchy and I wouldn't say they are conspiracy theories I feel like it's the reason those theories exist is because of the actions that open Ai and samman take like if you read the emails right then they tried to switch the meaning of open like it started as open source obviously and then they're like well open doesn't actually stand for open source it means that AGI benefits everybody equally it's like what are you saying like open is definitely referring to open source not that AGI will benefit all people equally it's like I don't know it's it's so weird yeah it's it's I agree it's like uh open means that it's an open technology to everyone like everyone can use it like oh okay and what like is there a technology that you know like we can say what like what does it mean that um Facebook is also open source then I mean it just makes no sense right uh and I feel like they're we're being like um they're kind of gaslighting us sometimes uh but also I don't really follow a lot of those news because I I feel like there's a lot of drama going on always uh with open Ai and I I fell in fell in love with their products like uh two years ago and then I kind of am not that much in love anymore so that that's I feel like a lot of people feel this way like when you realize the companies right all all of them like basically except for meta and mistol all of them are closed Source like the vast majority of them and then you look at like even content creators or people like if you see any audience polls vast majority of people are for open source but there's a massive disconnect of like big Tech and the companies actually developing these you know state-of-the-art models the vast majority of them is is closed source so it's kind of crazy that the people and the content creators want open source and then the people like the researchers and the people who are releasing the very best models all are for closed Source it's like insane disconnect yeah you know so um I was introduced to machine learning I think it was 2017 when my brother was uh doing some um machine learning projects He was training his own neural network and I remember remember the landscape in 2017 like people were um machine learning was something that like researchers were doing like it wasn't even any it wasn't like that many companies yet like it was obvious that that's the you know that's the future but it was most on Labs you know University State Labs and now suddenly it's everywhere but also like I have a question for you do people around you use like chat bot in real life like the all the time like your family or something I have a feeling that it's a small bubble that that cares about these things I mean I try to show everybody obviously and I even like help them set up the account because sometimes that's even too much friction but I don't know I mean it's definitely more and more like the the growth is there but I mean you bring up a great point it's crazy because for us when we're like in the AI field we feel like everybody knows about this everybody's using this but that's not the not the case at all like so many people think they're Advanced when they have chgb account like they think like they're on The Cutting Edge just because they have a chgb account and like I'm so mind blown how many people are it's crazy because there's one group that are completely oblivious and fine like you can say like they didn't watch The Right video or like they didn't get the chance to see it or whatever but there there's also a big second group that know about AI know about chgb they they know that it's going to change the world but they they don't do anything about it it's it's I don't know it's fascinating yeah or they just ignore it because they they I don't know why they ignore it like I for example um my brother that I mentioned that who made uh he was working in machine learning field for a while he he's not interested about any of this I guess he he's kind of curious about like these text to song tools or whatever he's interested in the creativity but he doesn't really care that much about like chat Bots or you know I don't know why it's not part of his life or and I know lot most people that I know don't don't care about it so like this makes me think like what needs to happen or like how capable the AI needs to be for people to start caring right yeah you know I I I kind of suspect that eventually it's just going to become a part of everyone's life silently it's just if a technology works well then nobody cares about it right um it like you don't think about how your car Works you're not excited about it because it just work so yeah yeah I I feel like that's eventually what's going to happen to Ai and um I I was wondering what do you think about like what for example AI agents what do how do they make your life better do you use them every day I mean uh obviously I use them way less than CH gbt perplexity and like just normal AI tools but like actually I mostly use them for like building and like learning about new Frameworks so for me it's kind of weird because I'm a content creator so I mostly use them when I make content about them I mean to be honest I should be like focusing more on automation but I feel like there's still um like missing stuff like I don't know I feel like we need like a really solid UI you mentioned that like you know we have autogen Studio that has a UI then crew AI is working on it but it still doesn't have it I feel like once it's like as effortless as chbt would just type like build a you know team of agent that does this and maybe with the combination of like the next generation of llms because like still like right now to build a solid team of agent you still have to like sit down and spend a couple of hours right it's not just like 20 minutes and you have it working I mean sure you can maybe for like simple tasks but to really fine tuneit and like you know prompt engineer every agent correctly and you know give it all the API Keys it needs it's still like multi-hour um Endeavor for every like basically for almost everything so I feel like I don't know I mean maybe I can like ask what would you recommend me to build like what do you think would teach me the most as a team of Agents uh well I I think you're right in the sense that it's it's a turnoff when you think about how you have to set it up and and you have to write all the prompts I think the promp thing is the problem because it's like so much work and I I you know I actually uh was trying in my in my video where I talked about autogen I was trying to say that maybe you can build Agee that build prompts for other agents right because then you can Outsource some of the work but even I like don't really use agents as often as I'd like to um but I so you're as a content creator I I think that you're at the disadvantage because simply because uh large language models are not that good yet when it comes to you know like just sounding natural like they just sound it's so obvious when I look at text it's so OB obvious that it's written by some sort of a CHD style chatbot so um in that sense you know if this is the type of work that you're doing it's it's a very it's very unfortunate but if you are a programmer um I have a feeling that like software developers can really benefit if they um have a team of Agents like one agent is you know uh writing this type of code the other agents is checking that code like in in that sense I I believe that software developers can benefit from this iterative uh thinking so to say uh or um but in the end like what's the biggest problem with not just agents but just large language models people don't trust them they don't they don't trust them for a reason right like they really do hallucinate it's actually everything they write is hallucination just that sometimes it's a right hallucination right so it's like you have to fact check everything when I was um writing this presentation I asked uh Claude to write more about these knowledge based systems in the' 70s and you know it invented so many weird things I just I was like where is this coming from and you know in the end as you said first you have to set up everything you need hours for that then you need to fact check everything you again you need a lot of time for it so I think that the point is that uh programmers can use these agents uh to like maybe uh start writing code I I think that if you need something more advanced you cannot really rely on agents if you're writing uh if you're creating content I would get I would I would recommend brainstorming they can uh get a lot of information and maybe summarize it for you and then you can uh start um whatever it is that you're working on whether it's a script or an article and um and like a sort of like personal therapy I recommend uh some sort of like a local local open source model that you can run with or something and uh maybe you have a problem that you need to resolve and you want to see it from different angles uh yeah you can you can chat to like a model and and you know get some ideas and insights that you wouldn't otherwise that that's what how I see it at least yeah I mean one team of Agents I did build was um like a research team for AI news and I wanted like um when I build it it was I think February or March I don't know so I set it for that month right and still it's like some of the news articles for like June last year and then like that was like one big issue and then second big issue was that like rating right so I wanted it to rate from like 1 to 10 on how interesting it is or like how important those AI news is but what I found is that it's always like somewhere near the middle it's kind of scared to give you like one or a 10 probably it it's probably closer to like a 10 it's like it might give you a nine but it I think it will never give you like a two or one cuz it feels like it's kind of offending the people um who made the news right so it's like it's so scared and then just overall it kind of just were like everything was like a six basically it was like Mark Zuckerberg talks to some Korean leaders it's like completely irrelevant uninteresting and it's like six like what why is that a six oh yeah this hilarious yeah you're right I one time I asked Claud to uh rate a text like a paragraph that I wrote and he said I refuse to read this highly suspicious text it's highly speculative questionable suspicious text and I was like I wrote it apologies uh but I still feel uncomfortable you know it's like you don't feel anything just give me my rating yeah you know that because right like I guess you know well they have to align them and um unfortunately I think that the first chat GPT 4 GPT 4 that the came out was really awesome and then it became dumber and dumber and dumber as they were trying to regulate it and now it's kind of useless and um yeah you're right about readings that's hilarious like it it's it's you're right I think that it's afraid to give you like a really low or really high grade like and I don't you know how many times I tried like I was testing I was trying to trick um CHP I would ask it to to do to do this uh once and then few hours later I would ask it again in another Tab and it would always give me different ratings so I was like I guess it's just making things up as it goes yeah so I mean I think a part of that is obviously the bias like you said like CLA refusing that's like shocking text or whatever and then part of it is just the hallucination problem of llms how they work right it's predicting the next token so even if you change one letter um it it will not give you the same answer and I mean especially if the temperature is not set to zero if the temperature is zero then yeah it will give you the same answer if you have the exact same prong but for CH gbt it's set to 0.7 so you know every time you get a different um probabilistic distribution of the of the token so like you yeah with like rating and stuff like that I think I don't know probably something open source that's like fine-tuned on rating where you just give it like thousands of examples of like this is boring this is interesting and you just be like super exact I think that will be perform much better than you know gp4 or clo free exactly yeah you know like if I I'm actually working on find tuning my own model for uh YouTube titles because it's every childboard is just so bad like I I wanted to give me uh not just the title but to explain to me why it's good and there are a few patterns right you you know this as a content creator like you want a title that's kind of like curios makes people curious and interested but not like in a negative way things like that and it's just they're so bad at it and I'm trying to find you in the model and you know I understand why open source models are so uh un uncensored open source models are so popular it sounds so super Shady it sounds like some sort of like a sax chat bot type of thing but it's just people want a conversation that just you know doesn't start with as an AI um chat bot I don't have feelings BL it's you just want like a normal conversation right so I'm I'm working on uh like creating a data set which is taking forever I have lo I I did I did exactly that I did that in like October I built basically uh database of videos like you know Vector database where I have the video description and then the title and I did that for like 200 or 300 videos and then I used gbd4 when I just give it an idea and it uses the vector base to search up like 10 or 15 most similar videos and then uses the same writing format of those titles to rewrite it uh for this video idea yeah yeah exactly yeah that's for example one interesting way a lot of people like fine tune them uh or they have like a database with um titles right um but that's one thing that this thing that you did is really interesting and um kind of lost thoughts to say something yeah anyway um I have a feeling that you know that's something that like cre crei or agents can do in a way with few shot prompting maybe you can like have um One agent that has like a access to like a lot of good examples and I'm just now I haven't tried it but that might be a good interesting idea but think about it right like me and you we've probably seen tens of thousands of YouTube titles just like by watching watchingg YouTube and like over the years just scrolling and seeing the videos so all of that is kind of stored in our memory even though we don't consciously remember every single one we kind of know like The Vibes and we know the titles that cut our attention the llms don't have that right if you just say it like write a YouTube title for something it will be like Beyond cringe it'll be so bad like it's it's insane if you don't give it an examples or anything so yeah I think the context window is just like having tens of thousands of examples I think that's probably the way either fine tuning or just database that it can call probably something like that but like I agree with you that for the open source I mean the unrestricted models people are like always so sketched out by that it's like oh my God like what are you what do you want to do do you want to like you know steal something or do something illegal it's like no I just want to have a useful chatbot with no bias that does exactly what I ask it right it's like yeah sometimes they're hilarious they because they're like usually uh the the database the data set kind of contains a lot of like real conversations from the internet they can sound super unhinged or kind of evil and crazy but like that's that's the that's I guess what the normal conversation would sound like and I really prefer those to like Char like chpd I cannot even use anymore like that's how bad it has got got like I ask it um for example I was using it for uh scripts right and I I would try to find um like some I would I would prompt chpt to write an analogy like uh yeah anyway so he has learned that I like analogies and I when I ask it like uh Hey like give me a python library for something it's like oh python Library it's like um tool in a tool set for like blah blah blah and I'm like no no just answer the question please it's completely unusable yeah sometimes I even have to like clarify like the user is a compet individual with good amount of knowledge about AI it's like if you don't say that it's like well artificial intelligence is this clever computer like just come on man it's like be useful yeah if you if you had one prompt while that's what we were talking about about agents with memory right because charp has has memory now it's learned from your chats but unfortunately it's it's like overdoing it a little bit it doesn't really know enough to actually be useful it just learned one thing about me and now it comes L tries to like feed me the same stuff so yeah wait so you have the memory feature I have I had it I I don't I I don't have it anymore because I canceled my subscription but yeah I had it for like maybe for a while yeah I I never even got it so oh really maybe it's because Europe I don't know yeah I don't know like I feel like Europe is like being treated as like this I don't know second grade world it's like even anthropic just didn't release CLA at all in Europe and then the features are coming like like custom instruction when it first came out like 6 8 months ago or whatever it was released for like a month or two in us and the only way I could get it is through VPN so like I don't know it's like so maybe it's because like Europe is so restricted when it comes to regulation stuff like that so the companies um you know just are more safe but it's it's annoying yeah of course I can imagine yeah I I mean maybe it's a good thing that uh European Union is trying to regulate some stuff um I always thought it like a USA is more like you know they they they go for stuff people are ambitious and when they have some tragic incidents then they're like oh we need to regulate stuff but like first they go for it right like that's when if you if you look at the videos from the like the beginning of the 20th century it's just a bunch of cars driving everywhere like it was just like well I guess we'll figure it out and only later they regulated it and stuff but Europe is kind of like different and maybe it's a good thing I don't know I'm kind of like I cannot decide for myself but it's it's sad that that you cannot have access to CLA because it's it's really good like that's for now my favorite I mean I'm using it through the console but yeah it's there's extra friction but I think you know you can um in prop lexity you can set it clo fre Opus or Sonet you can choose them in the settings as a default llm so even without you know console I think people can use it just through perplexity and changing the mode from web search to writing ah yes you're right yeah the perplexity Labs yeah yeah yeah I remember that so good you seem very passionate about using open source models to run your agents locally what makes you so excited about this well um privacy I just don't want anyone to train my conversations I guess you know who like who wants that um I don't trust companies at all I'm pretty sure that they're just using our data that we're just bu building data sets for them for free and it's such a it's a lot of work and they they're just get it get it for free and on top of that we have to pay them to use their chatbots right so um privacy um but uh having said that uh open source models are kind of bad at like they're not that they're not great agents so to say they're really good for like simple conversations um but whenever you try to plug it into some sort of um agent framework you realize that there are only few um few open source models that are fine-tuned to to to like the fun function calling those are the ones that work um and um but I dream of like one day what they're smarter like even when they do know how to make function calling they're still going to mess things up in some later step like it's never going to go smoothly that's the fortunately how it works and I hate that because I I I want I as I said I don't want to like give these companies um training data for free and uh not to mention that you know like as we said a lot of these um like API calls that you're making to like GPT 4 or something again you get that model that's like it's kind of like lobotomized or something it's it's never really that great so I I prefer the way that open source models uh kind of sound and I want to use them but unfortunately they're not there yet yeah I think this is actually one of my predictions that open source like this year open source models even though they will be less intelligent on paper they will become more useful just because as you said they're not like lobotomized like super you know restricted super limited uh I think this is a pretty like pretty safe prediction that I'm confident in that you know we will use Dumber models that are just not restricted and like I love that you brought up the Privacy argument nobody realize this is like nobody cares people putting stuff into C GPD that's like super personal and super private and figure like oh yeah it's never going to happen it's never going to come come up it's like eventually there will be some sort of a leak or they will just like you know government will overtake it or like just force them to get some data there will be something some situ situation where private data from these companies gets out there and like you know if it's if it gets like some breach and it ends up on the dark web like do you want all of your you know deepest darkest secrets to be on the dark web for a couple of dollars like people just don't think about what they're putting into these chat Bots and they just don't care at all and like the the the dumbest argument I hear is like why would I care about privacy I'm not a criminal and like people don't realize that you don't have to be a criminal to even get in trouble right like just look at what happened to Edward Snowden and Julian Assange right they just like did stuff that everybody thinks they're Heroes but the government went after them because they went against the government so like even if you don't do anything illegal or you know criminal it one day it can be used against you like people don't realize that you're you're right uh because uh like regimes can become repressive and they can go after people that criticize them for whatever reason it can be something ridiculous it doesn't have to be something like that's big you know you don't you don't have to be Snowden in order to be like persecuted right um and it reminds me of that leak that uh 23 and me had recently uh you know it's that um DNA testing company and a bunch of like private data uh about Jewish uh customers Godly so can you imagine like now you can like Target specific ethnic group you know all about them and and stuff it's just so creepy when you think about it and I I feel like people are um so excited about technology like the um AI assistant rabbit right it has a it has a camera it has a microphone it can hear you so yes they say that they respect privacy and stuff but one day we're all going to have some sort of like AI assistance with camera and microphone and uh we will be sending a lot of data and even if you don't uh end up S of like doing anything that you know might might put you in trouble like you're still giving your data very freely to these companies they're going to do something with the data to kind of maximize their profits that's the thing I'm so angry like we give so much of our data like to Facebook to Instagram to to Tik Tok like you know it's not okay like and then they they kind of become more profitable thanks to us like we're we're working for them for free and that pisses me off I don't want that people always go to like some extreme scenario when all you have to realize is that the agent or like whatever it is AI will act for the company's interest not for your own interest so it doesn't mean that you have to end up in jail or that it I don't know it would just like destroy your bank account it's like just a small misalignment is that the agent doesn't work for you it works for Facebook Google whatever over time that will have like massive influence like if that's you know if you use that agent for years to come like instead of improving your life it improves the Facebook's you know bank balance they make more profit because now they know more about their customers right and uh that yeah and we have been doing this very freely for like forever and uh you know um there's an interesting uh like um kind of like shift uh where in the beginning people had this idea that like actually companies are adapting to us they're trying to like create content for us to keep us on platforms but actually no what's happening is that we have algorithms that kind of shape shape our opinion which is what you um mentioned at the beginning of our conversation where our our opinions our beliefs are changed so that we stay longer on the platform so you know that's a that's and that's going to like get boosted even more with AI so I mean trust is absolutely essential and as you said like when a company like rabbit or whatever they say like oh yeah um everything is stored locally on the machine and it's not being sent like okay amazing but like we there is no way to like trust that right cuz like the only way to really trust anything is to see the source code that's why open source is so essential like imagine if Bitcoin was not open source and it was like close yeah trust us it's all good guys it's there like nobody would buy it and like it's the same with any proprietor software that you want to be like Linux one over Windows because it's open source because every can see their server what exactly what's happening there is you know you you can see like if there's some back door or whatever if it's proprietary and it's close to us and you have to go by the word of the CEO like yeah trust us it's safe we don't send it to our server like no there is no way like yeah yeah but exactly I mean we're going to see that more and I feel like we have already um kind of got adjusted to it a little bit with social media platforms and we already don't care that much about like our privacy um people share all kinds of stuff there I mean I you know I I'm not perfect at all I remember when chpt came out I wasn't thinking about any of these things and I would be like I just had a fight with my dad how do he is like this I am like that what do I do like I just started talking about like my private life and I thought that charg BT would help me it didn't cross my it didn't cross my mind as you know what the what the hell am I doing right so um yeah we we'll see I think that if something is convenient enough a lot of people are willing to trade their privacy for the convenience and uh I have very low expectations of people I have feeling that as long as it's very comfortable uh people are going to give everything um when it comes to their privacy for the convenience so but I think I'm Pim yeah I I definitely agree but on the other hand there's like over the last few years I feel like more and more companies and products are specifically focused on privacy first right so like doug. go is a search engine that's focus on privacy then you have Brave that's a browser focus on privacy you have like U block origin you have um you know VPN all of that stuff if you go back like five or 10 years none of that really was used right like yeah I don't know I feel like yeah it has to be as convenient as the other like the more mainstream method so that's definitely the truth because if something has more friction then nobody will use it but I don't know I think like I have some hope in you know developers and people just developing stuff that's privacy Centric and privacy focused and open source like if if if you have an agent that has such a massive impact on your life and you don't see you cannot see the weights and you cannot see the data sets that's another thing a lot of these open source llms don't actually show the data they trained on so they're not fully open source um yeah I mean if you can do that that's like so risky to Outsource your thinking to that right yeah it reminds me of that Meme with the that CTO we Mira whatever when she was asking about the training data and she was like yeah not face right yeah yeah like who who is believing that the CTO of a company doesn't know what training data they used like what is this trick but but it's actually it's easy to prove that they used all of you YouTube If you go to the mobile app and you use the voice chat and you press it and you don't say anything and you stop it it says thanks for watching and the reason for that is because if you have a pause in a YouTube video and like a long pause and then nothing happens the most likely outcome is thanks for watching end of video oh my God yeah well of course I mean they're going to have so many losses I already have a bunch of them and uh actually um that's something that I kind of uh was um I almost fell into that trap when I was starting with like messing with like Ai and making like a CHP gp4 API calls and stuff like that I was wondering if I can make like a small startup that um kind of creates these newsletters personalized newsletters and stuff but then I realized I'm scraping a bunch of like like giant um news um platforms right like I'm I'm SC keeping information from them what are the odds that you know they would be okay with that so so like that's yeah the and then if you think about like open data that's like usually not that great not not that great quality so it's the model is only as good as the data the data set like for example if you scrape YouTube titles to find un it to to to make good YouTube titles is it legal well probably not right but it would be a really helpful um helpful model you know I mean I guess it depends whether you use it for yourself or commercial purposes like I think if you just had that for yourself nobody would really care but like if you started you know using Google's data to build your own startup I don't think they would like that yeah I I think that they wouldn't like it anyway but if you just use it for yourself it's just going to go under the radar right nobody cares but you're right like you cannot turn it into a commercial product so that's so many unresolved issues in that you know AI industry so I I think that the next decade is going to be really exciting I mean have you seen the emad mustak leaving stability AI yeah I saw that yeah well he I always thought that it's a little bit strange that he is I I have a feeling that CEOs tend to be usually like a little less unhinged on Twitter maybe I don't know how to put it but then I remember the Elon Musk yeah I saw that yeah yeah so I think uh the main reason why he left I mean I watched the podcast where he explained it but it's basically to like make sure that AI is open and decentralized because nobody of like the you know competent Founders or like people who actually have influence none of these like big Tech figures are working on that like Elon only open source Gro after pressure from the public right so it's like yeah I think emat really is probably the main guy who really cares about AI being open source and yeah I don't know like we we need someone like that who actually has experience of building state-of-the-art models because like the the disconnect between the public and what's actually happening in these you know Elite circles it's it's insane it's it's it's like literally night and day yeah I agree I agree I I um well if if you know if you think about if you think about this stability right I feel like a lot of people um became interested in a AI thanks to them yeah there's a giant um number of people that are into illustration that use table diffusion or like a even 3D artists um you know when it comes to like visual stuff people that are doing that for lot for work uh I have a feeling that they kind of became introduced to AI thanks to them thanks to their like open source models so maybe that's how I started as well uh so yeah yeah you're right you're right but I just honestly I'm becoming more and more pessimistic because um it's been a while um we didn't have like a release of a really good open source models model for a while and um you know model blending is an interesting technique I'm really interested in that but I haven't seen much going on in the open uh Source sphere so do you think like there's a chance of open llms ever catching up to the closed ones I want to say yes but I am afraid that the answer is no just because you know I I could I could imagine that you know if enough people knew about these problems and topics and if we all kind of like gathered around this idea that we should uh have better open source models um and we all kind of invested even like 10 uh into some fund you know then we we would be able to have people that are very competent uh train um and align these models but what are the odds I I I just you know I think that the problem is that you're just the funding money that's it and I think it comes back to what we discussed before is like not enough people actually care about this and like are paying attention right so like I think it's a problem of like education lack of education and people just like willingly being blind cuz like you need people to understand that AI is the single most important technology in the world that's number one and number two you need them to understand just how dangerous it can be if it's controlled by a handful of people right so those two things once people realize it I think they're immediately on board with open source models but you know to get to make them realize these two fundamental beliefs it's like already a lot of work yeah and you know uh well you you create content on YouTube for example uh when I'll make a video about um let's say some open source tool or a model my my revenue is significantly lower uh than than the one that is about openi so like it's it's more beneficial yeah it's more beneficial for me to to to talk about open AI yet uh you know like uh it's kind of more beneficial for everyone to get introduced more to open source so it's like this tradeoff yeah yeah RPM is lower for at least in my case lower for like open source stuff that's crazy I've never tried like comparing that but yeah I mean I guess it makes sense it's it's based on the advertisers right so yeah I guess people would much more likely say like Chad gbt or open AI than Target open source like yeah yeah or uh you know I actually uh I have a lot of uh offers from sponsors uh to like promote some sort of like um close Source agent frame work or something like that and I I don't want to do that because I I just maybe I'm naive or something but I have a feeling that these things uh don't work good enough yet so you'd be paying someone to do something uh that you could do on your own maybe it's less convenient but it's just if anything education is the most important thing right now and and I I feel like it's somehow wrong to promote uh these close Source tools that are like that I again maybe I'm just being naive right now I don't know no it's just being selective like what brand you work with like I've gotten hundreds of offers ever since I started the channel and I only did one sponsorship so I mean I understand like you have to be selective about you know what companies you promote because there's so many scandals like you know people who promoted FTX the crypto exchange yeah you know it seemed legit until it was not and then you know how do you explain to your fans like that invested millions of dollars you all of these Finance YouTubers did that and then like like you cannot literally you know repay that money cuz like if as you said if every fan invests a bit of money that adds up real quickly so like being careful about what sponsorship you take I think that's smart I think yeah because right it's a little bit hypocritical if you uh you know like um you make these videos and it's about Ai and you kind of openly uh show that they're not really like they can achieve certain amount of things and then you kind of like promote some Clos Source tool is somehow just so wrong to me I don't know like uh something about it just can't like and also you as a YouTuber you you have to lose everything because your reputation is everything like people trust you and that's why they watch your videos but companies can what do they get to lose like hundreds or maybe few thousand dollars that's nothing for them it's pennies so yeah we I I think that I don't know about you but like the the deals that I'm being offered are just so bad like here maybe you can buy a microphone from from us or tell your audience about these acoustic panels or you know like um and then yeah these clothes or tools like usually like AI personalized chat b or something like we have millions of them like yeah how am I gonna sell this yeah you have to be like it has to align that it's actually useful product it's not something that you can just do with jgb and then obviously the offer has to be good it cannot be like we give you 15% affiliate commission it's like come on you know we need something that's like fair and actually usable yeah and uh I don't know if you've uh noticed um Ian we probably did because you make content on YouTube this triaa AI automation agen kind of moment I I was thinking a lot about it like like how many chat Bots do we need eventually like right uh it it was mostly maybe I kind of didn't get the idea it seemed to me like it was mostly about making chatbots yeah it's basically like do you know the smma model like social media marketing agency it's basically that but like instead of selling social media marketing to a company you try to sell them a chat bot but I mean as you said like in a lot of cases the company would just be better off using CH gbt to be honest because like the people who do that aren't f focusing on making the best product possible they're focusing on selling companies that you know want to get into the AI hype they don't know they they don't have the technical expertise to know what's good and then you know most of the people who actually run these AAA agencies they aren't expert Builders like of chat Bots or like they just cannot even build something that's better than chat gbt even if they have like proprietary database or something like that so yeah I think U there it's it's just going to it's only matter of time before it gets a kind of a bad reputation because the people who are interested in that they just want to get some get some business to you know get them 2,000 to build them a custom chatbot but like if that chatbot isn't actually more useful than CLA 3 or gbd4 then like that's not a long-term business model right yeah sometimes I wonder about that like um because I the reason why I brought it up is because I noticed that a lot of uh brand uh kind of sponsorship that I get like offered are chatbots and um I I don't know how I would sell that for example I mean if if I had my own child how how would I promote it like it it seems to me like it's maybe oversaturated um and that's why I really like what you're doing with AI agents I have a feeling I mean I I'm not like as I said I'm not a machine learning um expert I don't have formal education in that area but I am an engineer I studied civil engineering and architecture and I love just the technology I like I like I love to know how it works and stuff so to me this is kind of like the most exciting and obviously it's the most polarizing uh kind of like thing happening um and I just I'm yeah I just feel like I I can't wait to see where what's next in that sense I mean I definitely appreciate that in every video you make you try to use local and open source models even when the results are worse than using an API but one thing I actually realiz is that even if gp4 was open source tomorrow we couldn't run it like the hardware is so much behind like Hardware is cons especially consumer Hardware not like you know Nvidia AI gpus I'm talking about like consumer you know Nvidia either like Mac or doesn't matter like any consumer Hardware the the scaling is much slower than in the AI models that's like software right so that's crazy because even if like gbd4 or CL became open source tomorrow we couldn't run it like gb4 is like what 1.7 trillion parameters like there is no way you could even run it like even if you were able to run it the inference would be insanely slow to be just completely unusable right so that's like one thing I worry about like if Hardware is actually like if Hardware keeps improving slower than the software the AI models will we be even like if AGI was completely open source we wouldn't be able to run it right yeah it's true it's true well you know that's an interesting uh point for example the only sponsorship that I have is it's an affiliate link is uh actually like um a link that let you um rent Hardware because actually I use it so that's why I feel free to like recommend it to other people I I Cann I cannot forget when I I started merging some models and I was so excited about them they would actually pass um that um evaluation on the open and leaderboard and that would get scored and stuff and then I I remember I I rented like a GPU in order to run it because I couldn't run it locally right any of the models that I that I merged and I tried chatting with it and they were horrible I was like what have I done like I I had you know this false belief that I have done something good and yeah you need a lot of like yeah sure you can push and uh staff in some direction and try different things and get excited about them but ultimately if you don't have Hardware to run stuff it's just it's nothing right so and and and in that sense I think that AI uh is a little bit unfair uh and you really cannot do a lot of the stuff like I'm just limited with my Hardware like people in my comments say well you know you should have run like a llama 70 billion parameters something like I wish you know and of course I would have better results but I have like a regular laptop so yeah it's we'll see uh I I have a feeling that this is a giant problem uh for now and uh a lot of people cannot do anything because of those limitations that they're just limited with Hardware but don't you think like the cloud is kind of a trap because like yeah in the short term it's cheaper and you know better than um local hardware but like it's the same argument as we had like with the privacy because if the companies control all the Computing somebody can decide like oh you know you didn't do this Maya suddenly uh your um Cloud access is designed and like what yeah now it might seem like who cares but like once you know we have gpt7 or whatever like super Advanced AI models if you don't have access to that you literally cannot compete it's like not having access to the internet today like you cannot compete with people that do right so once it becomes so essential I think we have to be really careful if we're giving all the power to the big cloud computing you know AWS Google Oracle doesn't matter it's like I don't know I feel like the cloud is a big trap what do you think yeah well it certainly lose control uh and you're right about that and I ideally I I hope that we would get uh models that are seven or 13 billion parameters that have common sense uh better Common Sense reasoning so that maybe if they don't have all the knowledge they can at least kind of like conclude things rationally so that that would make them help more helpful because for example now every time I you know the test like um how many sisters that does Sally have like uh yeah like the answer is Sally has one sister but like every open source model is going to say Sally has six sisters or something ridiculous like that like they cannot kind of calculate stuff you have to train them to this specific riddle and it shows that they lack this Common Sense reasoning so I guess I I don't need the most knowledgeable small model I just need a model that has better common s sense reasoning and I think that I speak for everyone when I say this because that type of a model you can run like quantized uh versions of that model you can run on your laptop without a problem and they're going to be very useful so you need to rely on cloud so that's that's one solution yeah and also like people probably need to put more like importance on having Hardware even though like It's tricky because everything improves so fast so like you know a computer that you buy in like two or 3 years it's already obsolete like once we have those models that are not not just not just for the Privacy as we discussed but like also for like the freedom right to be like decentralized Computing so that no like if you piss off some company some Google or Facebook whatever they cannot just turn off your cloud computing and all of your agents that are running or all of your llms are turned off so I think you know Hardware like has will have much more value to be decentralized yeah yeah I absolutely agree uh so I'm I'm sorry I'm slowly running out of time so um yeah we have a good like already 90 minutes of content or something even more probably so yeah it's perfect it's great so yeah thanks for coming on the podcast Maya and it was a great thank for inviting me","output":"Thank you for having the conversation with me. It was really insightful to discuss the future of AI, open source models, privacy concerns, and the potential impact of AI on various aspects of life and work. The exchange of ideas on how decentralization of AI and community involvement could shape the future of technology was particularly stimulating. I appreciate the opportunity to delve into these topics and share perspectives."},{"instruction":"What are the main key points mentionned","output":"The detailed discussion between you and Maya encompassed several key points about AI, agents, open-source models, and the ethical considerations surrounding these technologies. Here are the main key points mentioned: 1. **AI Agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) Use and Trust Issues**: The conversation touched on how AI agents and large language models like GPT are polarizing, with individuals either fearing replacement or hoping for financial gain. Trust and the quality of interactions with these models were highlighted as significant concerns. 2. **Open Source versus Closed Source Debate**: Discussion on the transition of OpenAI from a non-profit, open-source initiative to a for-profit, more closed entity raised questions about accessibility and control over AI advancements. 3. **Importance of Open AI and Public Involvement**: There's a belief that AI development shouldn't be left solely to researchers or those in high positions. Instead, broader public involvement and feedback are deemed crucial for responsible AI evolution. 4. **Learning and Building AI Agents**: Maya shared her journey from learning Python and AI basics to building complex AI agent teams and inventing new workflows, emphasizing the importance of community resources and frameworks like AutoGPT and others for those new to the field. 5. **Issues with AI Trust, Regulation, and Misalignments**: The duo discussed concerns about openly available AI models being potentially regulated or restricted, reflecting on the implications of having large, powerful models controlled by few entities. 6. **Personal Information, Privacy, and Open Source AI**: A significant part of the conversation revolved around privacy concerns relating to using AI models hosted by corporations, potentially leading to misuse of personal data.

Hemp seems one of the most relevant gluten-free crop plants to meet such requirements. Its high nutritional value is comparable to soy. Moreover, almost the whole body of the hemp plant has a wide array of utility: industrial production of food, fiber, and construction materials. In view of environmental sustainability, hemp requires less pesticides or water in cultivation compared to cotton, a representative fiber plant. This short review investigates hemp’s sustainability as a plant as well as its utility value as a highly nutritional material in the food industry. Recent application research of hemp protein in food processing includes plant milk, emulsifiers, fortification of gluten-free bread, plant-based meat production, as well as membrane formation. These studies have revealed distinctive properties of hemp protein, especially in relation to disulfide (S-S)/sulfhydryl (-SH)-mediated interactions with protein from other sources. While its cultivation area and industrial use were limited for a while over confusion with marijuana, the market for industrial hemp is growing rapidly because it has been highly reevaluated in multiple areas of industry. Conclusively, with its sustainability as a plant as well as its distinctive useful property of the seed protein, hemp has promising value in the development of new foods. Keywords: disulfide, food processing, gluten free, hemp, high protein food, sustainability, meat analogue Go to: 1. Introduction The industrial revolution has rapidly enhanced the standard of living. However, large-scale factory production as well as modernization of agriculture have caused serious environmental problems which now threaten the existence of human beings [1]. Global warming has raised water deficiency problems [2]. Long-term use of pesticides in agriculture brought severe environmental pollution [3]. Moreover, the explosive growth of the world population and increasing number of meat-eaters not only imbalanced the supply/demand of livestock meat but also accelerated the food crisis [4]. Thus, in 2015, the United Nations adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and quoted that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, the prevailing COVID-19 situation and the Russia–Ukraine conflict remind us of the importance of food security [5,6,7]. Now, the food industry seeks protein sources from plants rather than from livestock animals as the plant cultivation poses less impact on the environment [8,9]. Hemp and its industrial products look to be one of the prospective keys in developing sustainable and resilient food systems [10]. In the viewpoint of cultivation, hemp has a short cropping period [11] and needs less pesticide or water compared to cotton [12], a representative fiber material plant. Moreover, the whole body of the hemp plant—its leaves, stalks, roots, and seeds—are utilizable without waste [13]. Furthermore, hemp seeds are comparable with soybeans in terms of nutrition [14]. Hemp has historically close relations with humans. Industrial hemp has long been used in various civilizations and religions since ancient times to the present day [15]. In Japan, a Shinto priest uses cannabis leaves to purge and bless the worshippers in a shrine where thick ceremonial hemp ropes are displayed. In the practical viewpoint, hemp played outstanding roles, especially in the Age of Exploration, as an essential material to make durable canvas and ropes for sailing ships. Later, in the World Wars era, the United States made full use of hemp as a reliable material to cover a shortfall of essential fiber products such as military uniforms and shoelaces, as well as parachutes while fully engaged in combat [16]. However, for a period of time, confusion with marijuana has limited the cultivation area and industrial use of hemp. Now, due to its sustainable growth characteristics as well as its versatile industrial usability, hemp is reevaluated as a promising crop in the era of SDGs [11]. The stalk is for fiber production, the leaves/roots for medicine, and seeds for oil until nothing is left. Moreover, its high nutritional value is comparable to soy and its unique characteristics in food processing appear to be high-profile in the food industry. Moreover, with its gluten content as low as 4.78 ppm, it is attracting attention as a gluten-free (<20 ppm) food material [17]. Oil meal, a residual material of hemp seed after expression of hemp oil, is a useful protein-rich material [18]. Recent application of hemp protein in food processing reveals its unique properties. Especially, in recent studies, its cysteine-rich amino acid composition and high sulfhydryl (-SH)/disulfide (S-S) ratio offer a glimpse of its distinctive features useful in food processing [19]. This short review verifies the usefulness of hemp focusing on its sustainability as a plant as well as its usability as a versatile food material. The authors also briefly introduce the historical relationship between human and hemp. Go to: 2. A Brief History of Hemp Cultivation in the World A recent study based on genome-wide phylogeography supports the leading hypothesis that Cannabis sativa was first domesticated in East Asia in the early Neolithic era [20]. Ren et al. [20] demonstrated that all current hemp and drug cultivars diverged from an ancestral gene pool currently represented by feral plants and landraces in China. Cannabis sativa, or “useful hemp” in Latin, is categorized into non-drug type hemp and drug type marijuana depending on the content of psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [21]. Industrial hemp contains only about 0.3–1.5% of THC, whereas marijuana contains 5–10% or more of THC. Hemp contains cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid, which has high medicinal potential in some conditions, such as difficult-to-treat seizures in children and adults [22]. The history of hemp and human society is long and complex—from being an essential commodity fiber crop in the Age of Discovery to its widespread prohibition under the umbrella of marijuana in the 20th century. The oldest known fossil pollen record compatible with cannabis was found in rocks 19.6 million years old (Early Miocene) from the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau (presently China), which has been proposed as the center of origin of cannabis [23]. There, hemp has been grown for 4000 and 6000 years for the production of textiles and fiber. However, in 1985, China banned the production of hemp after it ratified the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances [24]. Hemp production became legal again in 2010, and now the Chinese government encourages the textile industry, such as the Youngor Group, to manufacture hemp fiber products [25]. Although official data for China’s hemp cultivation and production are unavailable, industry estimated China’s hemp planted area at around 66,700 hectares (165,000 acres) in 2019. China’s hemp market value was also estimated at USD 1.7 billion in 2017 [24]. Hemp is also grown across Europe. The cultivation area in the EU has increased significantly from 19,970 to 34,960 ha between 2015 and 2019. The production of hemp increased from 94,120 to 152,820 tons in the same period. France is the leading hemp cultivator, making up for more than 70% of the overall EU production, followed by the Netherlands (10%) and Austria (4%) [26]. In the UK, in 1533, King Henry VIII mandated every farmer to cultivate hemp, a useful source of tough fiber to produce naval equipment such as rope, canvas, and sails to protect the land surrounded by the ocean [27]. However, in 1961, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs banned all forms of cannabis in the US and in Western Europe (except France) because of the confusion between hemp and marijuana. Note, as an aside, that Boris Johnson mentioned climate protesters as “hemp-smelling bivouacs” [28]. Hemp has played critical roles in American history. The Declaration of Independence was drafted on hemp paper. George Washington, the first president of the US, was to be found exhorting his head gardener to: “Make the most of the Indian hemp seed…and sow it everywhere” [29]. Federal restrictions on use or sale of cannabis first occurred with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 (“the Act”) following the repeal of the National Prohibition Act that prohibited the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcohol from 1920 to 1933. The Marihuana Tax Act imposed registration requirements and a tax on growers, sellers, and buyers of marijuana [30]. However, during wartime, the US government relied on hemp to make twine, tarred cordage, nets, shoelaces, carpets, and parachutes. After World War II, hemp has been cultivated in very small amounts and eventually found itself “unjustly imprisoned” [16] under the negative influence of its sister plant, marijuana. In 2018, the Federal Farm Bill has legalized hemp as an agricultural commodity and removed it from the controlled substances list [31]. Now, as of 2020, the US seems to be the world’s largest producer of industrial hemp with a licensed area of 465,787 acres [32]. The world market of industrial hemp was estimated to be USD 4.13 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow by a 16.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2022 and 2030 [33]. Growing demand for industrial hemp from a wide variety of application industries drives the market [34]. While the global market is undergoing limited growth under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is expected to grow at a faster rate with the high recovery rate of global economies [33]. Go to: 3. Reevaluation of Hemp for Its Sustainability Hemp has received a lot of attention because of its multipurpose usability, short production cycle, and low capital demand in cultivation, possibility as a carbon-negative material [11]. Here, recent examples are introduced to show how hemp is excellent as SDG-applicable materials. 3.1. Cellulose Gap: Applications in the Textile Industry During the Age of Exploration, hemp was a critical crop in Europe for the production of strong fiber suitable for canvas and ropes for sailing vessels. However, around the 18th century, cotton had become popular and had taken over the role as the principal fiber plant. Cotton fiber has a soft and comforting touch because cellulose of high crystallinity and purity compose the cell wall [35]. Now, the “cellulose gap”, an excessively high demand for natural fiber not being met by cotton production, encourages textile manufacturers to seek substitutes for cotton [12,36]. Moreover, while cotton is grown on only 2.4% of the cropland in the world, its cultivation uses 11% of the world’s pesticides [37]. Industrial hemp is one of the most relevant substitutes for cotton because it requires less pesticides and water in cultivation [12]. Duque Schumacher et al. [38] has demonstrated that hemp requires only one-third of the land area occupied by cotton to produce the same amount of fiber while cotton needs 2.5 times more water than hemp per unit cultivation area. Duque Schumacher et al. [38] concluded that in terms of agricultural activities for fiber production, hemp costs only one-twelfth of the cost for cotton. Especially, the ‘Henola’ variety has a shorter growing period as well as higher seed productivity, and thus looks preferable for introduction and cultivation [39]. Meanwhile, hemp fiber is known as coarse and stiff. It also has poor spinnability in the ring spinning system [40]. The blended use of cotton/hemp fibers for denim fabrics improved the thermo-physiological comfort as well as the soft-feeling nature. Moreover, higher air ventilation, higher water-absorbing property, and faster drying behavior were observed in the mixed fabrics compared to a pure cotton fabric [41]. 3.2. Hempcrete Hemp concrete or “hempcrete” is made of lime, water, and hemp shives, a by-product of fiber processing from hemp stalk. It is a bio-composite material used as an alternative to concrete for construction and insulation. Hempcrete is “carbon-negative” or “better-than-zero-carbon” because hemp plant absorbs more carbon from the air during growth than it yields during its production. Moreover, it continues to absorb carbon after being employed in construction, storing more carbon over the building’s lifetime than was emitted during construction [42]. In 2021, Pierre Chevet Sports Centre was built in France as the first public building using hemp concrete as the main construction material [43]. Moreover, preliminary 3D-printing research shows that hempcrete is printable with a density as low as 660 kg/m3, with adequate buildability and compressive strength for printing individual walls [44]. Such technical progress will widen the uses of hemp and the possibility to alleviate the negative impact of the construction industry on the environment. 3.3. Biofuels Human activities in industry and transportation have resulted in an extensive use of fossil fuels, negatively affecting the environment causing climate change, as well as global warming. Bioenergy is a green alternative for diverse energy needs. Thus, novel technology realizing effective conversion processes must be developed to enhance affordable biofuel production [45]. Marrot et al. [46] investigated the influence of the thermochemical conversion processing parameters on energy production as well as electrical conductivity. Two distinct scenarios of hemp biomass valorization were proposed, depending mainly on the selective pyrolysis temperature. Hemp biochar carbonized at 400–600 °C was classified as a lignocellulosic material with good potential for solid biofuel applications due to its high heating value. In contrast, hemp biochar carbonized at 800–1000 °C developed a graphite-like microstructure and displayed interesting electrical conductivity, opening doors for its use in electrical purposes. 3.4. Bioplastics Petroleum-based plastics cause many environmental problems, such as marine pollution, human health problems, and greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, bioplastics are drawing attention as alternatives to conventional ones [47]. Short hemp fiber is used to recycle polypropylene from textile wastes into wood plastic composites [48]. Cast hemp paper is laminated with bio-based plastics for sustainable packaging [49]. Hydrothermal and mechanically generated hemp hurd nanofibers are utilized for sustainable barrier coatings/films [50]. Hemp-based fiber is being applied even to the interior of high-end vehicles [51]. Hemp-reinforced natural fibers have been used in the interior components of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. A significant portion of the Lotus ECO Elise’s body panels are manufactured using hemp fiber-reinforced polyester composite. Go to: 4. Nutrition 4.1. Overview The nutritional value of hemp is attracting attention [14]. Hemp seed is composed of a white kernel and brown hull (Figure 1). The kernel is rich in protein, unsaturated fatty acid, and dietary fiber [52]. Hemp shares a unique high-protein, low-carbohydrate nutritional composition with soybean, distinctively different from other representative food materials such as rice and wheat, the protein/carbohydrate (%, w/w) content of which is 7.17/77.55 [53] and 10.6/73.2 [54], respectively. Hemp and soy are also rich in dietary fiber and unsaturated fatty acids (Table 1). Hemp oil is popular and the oil meal, a by-product of oil processing, is utilized in many protein-rich foods as well as animal feeds [55].

[39] and Kan et al. [56]. 4.2. Protein 4.2.1. Composition of Hemp Protein (Globulin, Albumin, and Others) The major protein in hemp kernel is edestin, accounting for around 70% of hemp protein. Edestin is a hexamer of identical subunits and belongs to the globulin family [57]. Each subunit consists of the acidic (−34 kDa) and the basic (18–20 kDa) chains [58]. An original single protein is cleaved into these two chains post-translationally at the Asn-Gly site [57]. An edestin subunit has five cysteine residues, two of which form a single intermolecular disulfide bond between basic and acidic subunits. The acidic subunit has one intramolecular disulfide bond. The remaining cysteine has a free sulfhydryl (SH) group. Edestin is less soluble in water or buffer with neutral or acidic pH, but soluble in a basic buffer [59]. As solubility in water and content of free SHs increases by sonication or pH adjustment of the edestin solution, control of the protein structure/function may be possible in food processing [60]. Despite its less solubility, edestin is known for its high digestibility [61,62]. The second major hemp protein is albumin, which has fewer disulfide bonds compared to edestin (globulin), thus having a flexible structure with higher protein solubility and foaming capacity [59]. Another noteworthy protein is rich in Met and Cys, and 20 mole % of the total amino acids contain sulfur [63]. It consists of two subunits made of 27 and 61 amino acid residues, respectively, which are held together by two intermolecular disulfide bonds [63]. 4.2.2. Extractability/Solubility Recently, reverse micelles (RMs) technology has been applied for protein extraction as it is convenient and cost-effective [64]. Protein extraction by RMs is achieved via two steps: “forward and backward” extractions. In the forward extraction, soluble proteins are encapsulated in the inner aqueous core of RMs, which are then recovered in the backward extraction by disrupting the RMs. Protein extraction from hemp flour using RMs did not require prior defatting in terms of extraction performance [65]. Hemp protein isolates obtained from non-defatted and defatted hemp flour shared similarities in proximate composition, subunit structure, as well as principal properties of protein including solubility, isoelectric point, emulsifying/foaming abilities, and thermal stability. Meanwhile, protein from non-defatted flour exhibited higher β-sheet content and surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, higher least gelling concentration and higher gel strength were observed in the gel formed by protein from non-defatted hemp flour [65]. 4.2.3. Digestibility/Allergenicity In vitro digestion tests demonstrated that hemp protein has a high degree of digestibility [61]. Moreover, most hemp allergens, such as the major thaumatin-like protein and lipid transfer protein, were eliminated in the protein-isolation or digestion processes. Mamone et al. [61] concluded that hemp protein is usable as an ingredient for hypoallergenic foods. 4.2.4. Disulfide Structure Hemp protein has a unique feature in view of the disulfide structure. It shows much higher free sulfhydryl content than soy protein [66]. The cysteine content of hemp protein is 1.6–1.4 g cysteine/100 g protein [32,67], higher than pea (1.0 g cysteine/100 g protein) and broadbean or soybean (1.1–1.3 g cysteine/100 g protein) [68]. Moreover, at pH 8, while the free sulfhydryl content of soy protein is 1.6 × 106 mol/g protein, the counterpart of hemp is as high as 3.9 × 106 mol/g protein [66]. Tang et al. [66] discussed that the poor functional properties of hemp protein seems mostly ascribed to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between individual proteins and subsequent aggregation at neutral or acidic pH, because it has a high free sulfhydryl content. Meanwhile, exchange reactions between disulfide (S-S) and free SH play critical roles in the cereal biology [69] as well as food processing [70,71]. In the preparation of microparticles made from soy protein isolate and egg white, the egg white protein serves as a free sulfhydryl “donor” to accelerate intermolecular S-S linkage with the soy protein [72]. Thus, hemp protein with a high free SH content should have unexplored unique processing characteristics. Heat-dependent formation of the envelope made of hemp and soy protein is just a glimpse of this attribute [73,74]. Go to: 5. Applications of Hemp Protein to the Food Processing Industry 5.1. Hemp Milk Increasing demand for plant-based milk has enlarged its industry due to lactose intolerance, cow’s milk allergy, and vegan lifestyles [75]. The principal predictor of dairy consumption in the acceptance of dairy products was “Nice”, relative to the other 3Ns, that are, Natural, Necessary, and Normal. “Taste” was the most relevant keyword in consumers’ selection of dairy products [76]. Hemp milk, with its highly nutritional value and low allergenicity, looks to be an attractive alternative to dairy, soy, and nut milks. Comparison of milk products in the market reveals hemp milk as a better source of minerals than other dairy and plant milks. Hemp milk does not taste that different but has a “nuttier” flavor in comparison to soy or rice milk [77]. High pressure homogenization following pH adjustment realized non-thermally processed hemp milk, which is remarkably stable, showing negligible phase separation in storage for 3 days at 4 °C [78]. 5.2. Emulsifier Stabilization of emulsion-based colloidal structures by food ingredients has attracted attention in the food and pharmaceutical, as well as cosmetic, industries [79]. In the Pickering emulsion [80,81], solid particles are adsorbed onto the interface between the two distinct phases, such as oil and water, and inhibit emulsion droplets from coalescence (Figure 2). Stabilizing the oil/water boundary by plant-based materials such as proteins and organelles is useful in exploring emulsion systems in developing new foods [82]. Examples include egg-free mayonnaise [83], barley-based non-dairy milk [84], probiotic encapsulation [85], as well as additive-free, gluten-free rice bread [86]. However, these bio-based emulsions tend to be unstable due to gravity-induced separation (creaming/sedimentation), flocculation, and coalescence (Figure 2). An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is foods-12-00651-g002.jpg Figure 2 Formation of oil/water emulsion and its four major destabilization patterns. Hemp protein is considered a novel emulsifier in food systems. Dapčević-Hadnađev et al. [87] compared the behavior of two types of hemp proteins in the sunflower oil-in-water emulsions. Salt extracted “micellar” hemp protein (HMI) with a less-denatured structure exhibited higher solubility as well as slightly higher surface/interfacial activity than alkali-extracted and isoelectric-precipitated hemp (AIH) protein. HMI formed emulsions composed of relatively small droplets with enough static repulsion between droplets. Individual droplets were covered by protein film. However, low viscosity of HMI-stabilized emulsions facilitated fast droplet movement and eventually led to increased creaming and coalescence at lower protein concentrations (0.25–0.75% w/w). Meanwhile, AIH exposed hydrophobic sites as well as sulfhydryl groups due to pH-induced unfolding of protein structure. In AIH-stabilized emulsions, bridging flocculation occurred during emulsification by the formation of protein-connected droplet aggregates. However, interestingly, emulsions stabilized with 1.5% (w/w) AIH showed creaming and coalescence stability much better than emulsions with lower AIH concentrations. Formation of a weak transient network of floccules as well as higher continuous phase viscosity suppressed the movement of the droplets, resulting in the improvement of the emulsion’s stability. Feng et al. [88] sought to make complexes of pectin and hemp protein through electrostatic force. Monodisperse features of hemp protein in the aqueous phase improved by the increase of surface charges as well as the blockage of free SH groups. The presence of pectin inhibited the coalescence and provided substantial physical strength to ensure stability during the storage test. On the other hand, Li et al. [89] sought to stabilize hemp protein-mediated oil/water emulsion by high-intensity ultrasonic treatment. The emulsifying properties were improved, showing a more uniform particle distribution with small and well-dispersed particles. With its unique behavioral attribute in the oil/water interface, hemp protein is expected as a promising competitor against zein [90], well-used in the Pickering-based food systems. 5.3. Gluten-free Bread Due to the world-wide prevalence of celiac disease and wheat allergy, demand for gluten-free foods, especially for bread, is increasing [73]. However, most gluten-free breads are starch-based and thus generally low-protein and high-carbohydrate. Therefore, researchers are trying to improve the nutritional value of gluten-free breads by fortification of nutrients [91]. Hemp is one of the ideal food materials because of its high protein content, low content of saturated fats, and high content of unsaturated fatty acids such as ω3 and ω6 [92]. Addition of hemp protein concentrate significantly improved the nutritional value of the starch-based gluten-free bread [93]. It also changed the rheological characteristics of the gluten-free dough and reinforced the structure. Moreover, sensory acceptance on color and flavor was confirmed for the bread. Limited amylopectin recrystallization as well as limited hardening of the crumb were observed during storage. Evaluation of the effect of hemp seed flour addition and following sourdough fermentation on the aroma of gluten-free bread was conducted [94]. By a metabolomic approach, production of volatile organic compounds of flavoring and health benefits were identified. Among them, 1-heptanol is a food flavor generally used to confer a musty, pungent leafy and green nuance [95]. The odor of 2-heptenal is described as a pleasant almond flavor. 2-pentanone-3-hydroxy has a caramel-sweet, buttery, and hay-like aroma [96]. On the other hand, hexanoic and octanoic acids with unpleasing odor were also identified. Therefore, strategic adjustment of the dough composition as well as baking conditions are the challenges for future studies for a balanced flavoring of the bread. We are so accustomed to the fresh aroma of wheat bread. Thus, in developing bread without using wheat flour, exquisite formation of its aroma is critical for it to be accepted by consumers. Nissen et al. [94] proposed the utilization of hemp flour as a vehicle to carry the flavor and bioactive compounds in bakery products. Volatilomics appears to be a useful technical tool in designing the organoleptic characteristics of gluten-free breads. 5.4. Hemp Meat Demand for high quality vegan meat made of plant materials is increasing based on the shortage of animal stock due to the global increase of human population, as well as in view of animal welfare [97,98,99]. 5.4.1. Hemp as a Nutrient Feed Stuff Hemp cake, a residual material of oil expression from the hemp seed, has long been utilized for livestock feeds [100,101]. It is a highly nutritive as well as sustainable feed stuff for cows [102], quails [103], cockerels [104], pigs [105], and broilers [106]. Now, research is in progress to utilize hemp protein “directly” as a material for plant meat. 5.4.2. Vegan Meat Made of Hemp/Soy Proteins The commercially available vegan meat products, represented by high moisture meat analogues (HMMAs), are made mostly from soy. In the production of HMMA, protein-rich materials, such as soy protein isolate, are subjected to a twin screw co-rotating extruder. Thermomechanical stresses are applied to the material at a high-water content (>40% w/w) followed by forcing through a cooling die [107]. Soy-based HMMAs have a desirable chewy meat-lite texture. However, cultivating soy in colder climates such as in northern Europe is challenging. Thus, Zahari et al. [108] sought to investigate whether and to what extent soy protein isolate could be replaced by hemp protein concentrate in the production of HMMAs. A rapid visco analyzer (RVA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) were used to investigate pasting features and melting temperature of the raw materials. They found that hemp protein absorbed less water and requested higher temperature for denaturation compared to soy protein. However, replacement of soy protein with hemp protein was possible up to 60% to yield layered and fibrous meat-like extruded products. Based on the DSC and RVA results, a higher cooking temperature and longer retention time are recommended for the extrusion of hemp/soy meat, as hemp protein needs a higher temperature for denaturation. Furthermore, to develop a more laminar fiber structure, the interior structure of the extruder should be equipped with more complicated kneading elements such as screws to hold the material longer in the extruder. Zahari et al. [108] concluded that while future studies are needed to optimize the condition of the extrusion process and the formulation matrix, it is possible to substitute soy protein with hemp protein without sacrificing the quality in meat analogue formulation. 5.4.3. “Meaty” Hemp Meat: Anisotropy and Fibrousness To develop plant-based meat with a realistic “meaty” texture, anisotropy and fibrousness are among the most critical factors [109,110]. Anisotropy is the property of a material expressing different behaviors depending on the directions from which the external pressure is applied [111]. Meat structure is highly directional. On the molecular scale, actin and myosin form well-ordered and parallel arrays of filaments. On the macroscale, those filaments form into the muscle fiber bundles [112]. During a high-moisture extrusion of plant protein-based materials, the dynamics of protein aggregation and phase separation are the keys for the formation of meaty fibrous structures. The fibrousness is expressed during migration from the die to the cooling zone through a “sub-layer transformation” cross-linking [113]. The desired anisotropic structure of plant-based meat analogues has been accomplished by extrusion at high water content (>40%) and at elevated temperatures (>100 °C) followed by passing through a cooling die which prevents expansion of the matrix at the ejection from the extruder [114]. Interestingly, there are two distinct hypothetical mechanisms to explain how the anisotropic structure is made in the extruded plant meat. One is the “cross-linking” mechanism in which the anisotropic structure is explained as being formed by the alignment of protein and the subsequent stabilization at the molecular level. Protein molecules are unfolded and align along the direction of flow, followed by stabilization of the aligned proteins by way of interactions between/among proteins newly developed by disulfide or hydrophobic interactions. The other is the “multiphase” mechanism in which formation of the anisotropic structure is explained due to the existence of multiphase systems [114]. Thermodynamic immiscibility of the biopolymers involved triggers the occurrence of phase separation in the extrusion process. The dispersed phase is deformed in the extruder die, then directed along the flow. The subsequent cooling process solidifies the material resulting in the anisotropic structures of the plant-meat products. In the case of extrudates using soy protein isolate solely as a protein source, the formation of anisotropic structures are derived from a multiphase system. Cryo-imaging and X-ray analysis of the extrudates revealed a water-rich dispersed phase surrounded by a continuous protein-rich phase with less moisture. Meanwhile, significant changes of protein–protein interactions were not observed [114]. Thus, in this model system, multiphase systems rather than cross-linking of proteins seemed to be the primary factor of the anisotropic structure. On the other hand, during high-moisture extrusion processing of meat analogues made of pea protein and fatty acids, protein–protein interactions played key roles in the product structure [115]. Micromorphology analysis demonstrated that formation of anisotropic fibrous structures in the cooling die was disturbed by the coalescence of fatty acids of an unsaturated type, such as oleic and linoleic acids. Meanwhile, saturated stearic acid dispersed uniformly in the protein matrix, facilitating formation of disulfide bonds and promoting the generation of anisotropic fibrous structures along the extrusion direction [115]. Moreover, in the case of plant meat made by high-moisture extrusion processing of pea protein, amylopectin, and stearic acid, its anisotropic fibrous structures have been explained by the “anchor orientation and flexible cross-linking” mechanism [116]. In the cooling zone, stearic acid played the role of anchors, preventing the unfolded protein structure from refolding. In contrast, amylopectin facilitated the rearrangement, disulfide formation, and polymerization of the protein molecules. Thus, amylopectin and stearic acid synergistically mitigated the interaction between proteins. These aggregates with loose and flexible structures aligned along the extrusion direction and successfully formed anisotropic and fibrous structures in the extruded products. Nasrollahzadeh et al. [67] compared the structure of plant meat made of hemp protein with the counterpart made of pea proteins. The proteins were respectively mixed with maize starch and were subjected to high moisture extrusion. The extruded pea meat was soft and isotropic while hemp meat was hard and anisotropic. The protein structure was investigated using SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of a reductant, dithiothreitol (DTT). In the case of the hemp meat sample, some protein bands derived from edestin appeared only in the presence of DTT. In contrast, less-intense protein bands of pea meat appeared regardless of the presence or absence of the reductant. The results demonstrate a higher contribution of disulfide cross-linking in the polymerization of hemp protein during the extrusion process than in the case of pea protein. As mentioned above, hemp protein contains more cysteine (1.6–1.4 g cysteine/100 g protein) than pea protein (1.0 g of cysteine/100 g protein). Thus, in the case of hemp meat, protein–protein interactions played critical roles in the formation of anisotropy and fibrous-like mesoscale structures. More recent studies support the view by demonstrating that addition of cysteine controls the texture of plant meat. Addition of cysteine changed both the physical and chemical properties of extrudates made from soy protein isolate and wheat gluten [117]. The SH-containing amino acid promoted the fiber structure formation and affected the degree of texturization and rheological properties, as well as microstructures of the extrudates by rearranging the disulfide-mediated cross-linking among protein molecules [117]. Meanwhile, addition of L-cysteine or L-ascorbic acid on the material of the pea protein/wheat gluten blend altered the fibrousness and the mechanical properties of the meat analogue obtained by the high-temperature shear cell [118]. Cysteine accelerated protein polymerization through the disulfide–sulfhydryl exchange reactions in the heating process, yielding a continuous protein network upon cooling. Conclusively, the alternative mechanism of the generation of fibrousness and anisotropy in the plant meat, whether cross-linking or multiphase, depends on the protein species, extraction process of the protein, and the subsidiary materials such as starches and fatty acids. In the case of hemp protein, its high content of free sulfhydryl groups is expected to produce the unique “meaty” texture of the products. 5.4.4. Membrane Formation Recently, it was reported that a dough made of egg white and soy protein isolate was baked into a high-protein, low-carbohydrate bread [73]. Egg white protein and soy protein formed heat-dependent elastic air-cells which work to confine enlarging gas in the baking process. Intermolecular S-S bonds contribute to the formation of the cell membranes in which egg white protein works as a donor of SHs to soy proteins [72,73]. Similarly, a dough made of hemp protein/soy protein is baked into a hollow ball (Figure 3) [74]. An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is foods-12-00651-g003.jpg Figure 3 A “roly-poly” wiggle ball made from soy/hemp protein complex. (a), protein-rich outer shell; (b), fiber-rich inner bottom part. Reprinted/adapted with permission from Ref. [74]. Copyright 2022, NARO. The outer shell is made of the mixture of soy/hemp proteins which are linked with intermolecular disulfide bonds. Dietary fiber, isolated from the protein complex, is located in the bottom of the ball. Thus, the ball has a low center of gravity and behaves like a “roly-poly” wiggle ball. In this case, hemp protein, rich in free SHs [63,66], is considered to work as a SHs donor, as egg white protein worked as a donor of free SHs in the bread made of egg white/soy protein isolate [73]. Electron microscopic observation of the protein-rich outer shell (Figure 3a) and fiber-rich inner bottom part (Figure 3b) reveals distinct structures. The former has a dense structure while the latter has a reticulated structure with small void spaces. Contribution of the unique structure to the ball’s texture is being investigated by sensory evaluation in our lab. Conclusively, application of hemp protein on food processing will broaden the variation of the food products. Go to: 6. Comparative Summary of Hemp, Cotton, and Soybean The industrial utility of hemp, cotton, and soybean is outlined in Figure 4 and Table 2. Hemp is usable as both a fiber and food material (Figure 4a). Cotton is used mostly for fiber production, while soybean for food processing (Figure 4b,c). As all seeds are available for oil expression, and the residues are utilized as a highly nutritional food material (hemp and soybean) or for fiber production (hemp and cotton), they are all deemed sustainable. However, as hemp is more sustainable than cotton or soybean in view of cultivation and utility, ++ was marked only for hemp in the sustainability row (Table 2).

Go to: 7. Conclusions Hemp is a sustainable plant requiring less water or pesticides in cultivation compared to cotton. It has a short growth period and almost its whole plant body has versatile utility value. Hemp seeds are high-protein, low-carbohydrate, and rich in dietary fiber and unsaturated fatty acids. After expression of oil from the seeds, the residual mass is a useful protein-rich material for food processing. Moreover, hemp seed protein has distinctive characteristics suitable for developing new foods such as an emulsifier, plant-based meat, and gas-retaining membrane. The cysteine-rich protein feature realizes unique disulfide-mediated interactions with protein from other sources and is thus expected to facilitate development of new food materials. Meanwhile, hemp protein is reported to be less soluble, and a higher temperature is needed for processing compared to other plant protein. Therefore, suitable reaction conditions should be investigated for future application in the food industry. Further scientific understanding will facilitate expanded use of this less-investigated protein compared to soy protein. Conclusively, hemp is a suitable plant with versatile utility in this SDGs era. Hemp seeds and the protein are expected to be promising food materials in the food industry.

Based on the provided script's structure and content, we can make an estimate. Assuming a moderate pace of speaking, which is approximately 150 words per minute (a commonly used average for video and speech), we can calculate the video's length with the following steps: 1. Count the total number of words in the script. 2. Divide the total words by the average speaking speed (150 words per minute). Unfortunately, without the exact word count of your script, I can't provide a specific duration. However, you can quickly estimate the length using the method described: - If your script is about 450 words long, the video would be roughly 3 minutes long ((450 div 150 = 3)). - If it's shorter or longer, adjust the calculation accordingly. To improve accuracy, consider other factors like the time taken for transitions, pauses for emphasis, animations, or visual cues that may either shorten or lengthen the actual speaking time. If your video includes intros, outros, or any form of interlude, make sure to account for those as well in your total runtime. For a more precise estimate, you can do a read-through of your script, timing how long it takes to speak it naturally, including any pauses you plan to make for dramatic or informational purposes."},{"instruction":"[Opening Scene: Animated character standing in a brightly colored, animated hemp field.

Introducing the subject matter usually needs a clear and engaging start, so viewers understand and get interested in what's forthcoming. - Each section transition, such as moving from hemp and marijuana's comparison to discussing delta-9 THC's specifics, might take about 15 seconds to transition smoothly while keeping the viewer engaged. - The main content sections, which explore the differences between hemp and marijuana, the legality of hemp, and its uses, might average around 20-30 seconds each, depending on how much detail you dive into and how fast the narrator speaks. - The concluding remarks and sign-off could also take about 30 seconds to wrap up the information shared and to say goodbye to the viewers in a memorable way. - Assuming there are minor pauses for transition between sections and allowing some moments for viewers to absorb information, particularly when showing animations or other visual aids, add an additional 20 seconds spread throughout the video. Given these assumptions and without knowing the exact word count or pacing: - The opening might take about 30 seconds. - Four main sections (Hemp vs. Marijuana, THC content, Uses of Hemp, Legality and wrap-up) could average about 2 minutes, assuming approximately 30 seconds each. - Closing remarks might take about 30 seconds. - Miscellaneous transitions and pauses could add an extra 20 seconds. The total estimated video length would be approximately 3 minutes and 20 seconds. This estimation assumes a moderate speaking pace and includes time for brief pauses and transitions. If the animated character interacts more with the visuals or if there are longer pauses for effect, the video could be longer. It is also dependent on the style of the video; for example, a fast-paced, informative video might run slightly shorter, while a more exploratory or introspective pace could extend the runtime. Performing a timed read-through of the script, as suggested previously, remains the most reliable method to estimate the exact length."},{"instruction":"good. lets rewrite the script. make it less campy and also we are trying to help people understand that they can get the same benefits body & mind as well as that same great high they've always loved from a technically legal plant.","output":"**[Opening Scene: A serene, beautifully animated hemp field under a clear sky.

This blog post is designed to demystify CBD, shedding light on its health benefits and providing you with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about incorporating CBD products into your lifestyle. **What is CBD?** Cannabidiol (CBD) stands out in the cannabis family for its therapeutic potential without the psychoactive effects. Unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is known for its mind-altering properties, CBD offers a way to harness the plant’s benefits while remaining clear-headed. Extracted primarily from the hemp plant, a cannabis plant variety with low THC levels, CBD has found its way into an array of products—from oils and tinctures to topical creams and edible treats. Its versatility not only in form but in application makes CBD a fascinating subject of study and use in wellness circles. **Navigating the Benefits of CBD** The journey of CBD from alternative remedy to mainstream popularity is backed by a growing body of research and countless anecdotal reports. Users and some scientific studies suggest that CBD may help with a variety of conditions including anxiety, chronic pain, sleep disorders, and more. However, it's essential to approach these claims with a balanced perspective, recognizing the need for further research and understanding CBD's effects can vary from person to person. **Choosing the Right CBD Products** The explosive growth of the CBD market comes with an overwhelming variety of products, each with its own strengths. Whether you're drawn to the pure concentration of CBD isolate, the broad-spectrum appeal of additional hemp compounds without THC, or the full-spectrum option with its trace amounts of THC for a potential entourage effect, there's a product to match your preferences. However, with variety comes the challenge of quality assurance. Navigating the world of CBD requires an understanding of how to evaluate products for purity, potency, and safety. **The Path Forward** As we delve deeper into the benefits of CBD and how to choose the right products, remember that knowledge is the first step towards making empowered decisions about your health and wellness. Let's embark on this journey together, with open minds and a commitment to understanding one of nature's most intriguing gifts.

At Middle Guy, we're not just focusing on the end product; we're inviting you on a captivating voyage from seed to sensation. But, to truly appreciate this journey, let's start with the fundamentals: What is CBD, and how does it differentiate itself from THC? # The Essence of CBD vs. THC CBD (Cannabidiol) and THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) are both cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant, yet they embark on divergent paths in their interaction with the human body. THC is celebrated for its psychoactive prowess, casting a spell of euphoria that has become synonymous with cannabis. CBD, on the other hand, is the serene sibling, offering a calming embrace without the intoxicating effects. Science shows us that while THC engages directly with the brain’s receptors to alter mood and perception, CBD takes a more subtle route, potentially easing anxiety, pain, and inflammation through indirect interactions with our body's systems. # From Plant to Product: The Journey of CBD The transformation of the humble hemp plant into the plethora of CBD products adorning the shelves at MiddleGuy.shop is nothing short of alchemical. It begins with the careful selection of strains rich in CBD yet low in THC, adhering to legal thresholds that define hemp. The extraction process then plays a crucial role in defining the purity and potency of the final product. At Middle Guy, we champion methods like CO2 extraction, which ensures a clean, solvent-free concentrate teeming with CBD’s beneficial properties. Beyond extraction lies the art of formulation, where CBD is meticulously blended into oils, topicals, edibles, and more. Each product is a testament to innovation and holistic wellness, crafted to meet the nuanced needs of our discerning clientele. # Test Your Knowledge: The Middle Guy CBD Quiz Feel like you've got a handle on CBD?

Together, we will make this grand experiment a resounding success! Warm regards, [Your Name] [Your Position] Disney Store, Fuengirola Write a forum convo soon after this where the store now has the name “Kangurola” and the logo is a pink silhouette of a kangaroo, They wonder why this was done as Kangaroos are not native to Spain, and don’t appear there at all, A staff worker spills the beans and says similar “weird” names will soon be rolled out globally, User1: MagicMerchFanatic Hey everyone! Have you seen the new “Kangurola” store in Fuengirola? Walked past yesterday, and I was taken aback by the pink kangaroo logo where our beloved Disney Store used to be. I mean, it’s cute, but kangaroos in Spain? What’s the connection? Anyone else scratching their heads over this? User2: DisneyDreamerESP Right?! I thought I was in the wrong place for a second. It’s such a drastic change from the Disney castle logo. I get that Disney wants to try something new, but a kangaroo seems so random. I’d love to know the thought process behind this. User3: CastMemberCarlos Hey folks, I work at the newly named Kangurola and got some insider info. Apparently, this is just the beginning. Disney’s planning to roll out more stores globally with similarly “unique” names and logos. The idea, from what we’ve been told, is to create a distinctive identity for each store while still keeping the Disney magic alive through the products we sell. They want each store to stand out and spark curiosity, hence the unexpected kangaroo for Spain. User4: DisneyHistorian That’s fascinating, Carlos! It’s a bold strategy, aiming to mix local uniqueness with global branding. This could actually turn into an interesting case study on global branding strategies. Although, the choice of a kangaroo for Spain still puzzles me. It’s neither local nor directly related to Disney’s main icons. User5: PopCulturePundit CastMemberCarlos, thanks for spilling the beans! This is super interesting. I’m guessing the “Kangurola” name is a playful mix of “kangaroo” and “Fuengirola”? It’s certainly a conversation starter, but it has us talking, right? Maybe that’s the point. Yet, I can’t help but feel a bit nostalgic for the traditional Disney Store vibe. User6: ThemeParkTheorist Absolutely, PopCulturePundit. It’s a marketing move that catches attention and differentiates each location in a unique, albeit quirky, way. The nostalgia for the classic Disney Store is understandable, but with the retail landscape changing so rapidly, perhaps an innovative approach was necessary. Still, the effectiveness of this strategy in retaining the Disney essence while appealing to new customers remains to be seen. User3: CastMemberCarlos Spot on, everyone. The feedback, both positive and puzzled, is exactly what the company is looking for. It’s all about creating buzz and reinvigorating the brand in a saturated market. And yes, PopCulturePundit, you nailed the name origin! It’s meant to be fun and make people do a double-take. While we all miss the Disney Store as it was, Kangurola aims to offer a new kind of magic. Plus, the Disney products inside remain as enchanting as ever. User7: EcoEthicist Interesting discussion, folks! From a branding perspective, it’s bold and innovative. However, I’d be curious about the environmental ethos behind the new direction, especially concerning local wildlife and culture. Adopting a kangaroo, an animal not native or related to Spain, might be seen as overlooking local biodiversity. Would love Disney to incorporate local ecological and cultural elements into their global presence more thoughtfully. User8: NostalgiaNerd Change is always a bit shocking at first, especially with something as iconic as the Disney Store. But let’s give it some time. Who knows? Maybe “Kangurola” will become as beloved to us as the Disney Store once was. At least the inside still brings the Disney magic we know and love. User2: DisneyDreamerESP Thanks, Carlos, and everyone for your insights! It’s definitely a big shift, but understanding the strategy behind it makes a difference. I’m curious to see the other “unique” names and logos Disney comes up with around the world. Here’s to new beginnings and the magic that remains within! Write a follow up where the same worker goes into more detail saying the “Disney Store” name will soon go online only, and this is why the renaming has been done, In fact, the store in Miramar Shopping Centre (also in Fuengirola) is set to go under the same name in a few weeks, but there will be a smoother transitional period User3: CastMemberCarlos Hello again, everyone! I noticed the buzz our previous conversation generated about the rebranding to “Kangurola” and wanted to dive a bit deeper into the rationale behind it, especially considering the strong reactions and curiosity it sparked. Firstly, I’d like to clarify that the decision to transition the “Disney Store” branding to an online-only presence is at the heart of this change. Disney’s strategy moving forward is to concentrate the Disney Store experience on digital platforms, making it more accessible to a broader audience globally and allowing for a more diverse and dynamic product offering. Given this shift, the rebranding of physical stores like ours to “Kangurola” represents a thoughtful divergence from the traditional store concept, allowing these spaces to maintain their charm and appeal in the face of an evolving retail landscape. The choice of distinct and memorable names for each location is a strategic move to foster a sense of novelty and curiosity around what these stores will offer, especially since they will continue to retail Disney products alongside new and exclusive lines. I can also confirm now that the store in the Miramar Shopping Centre will be embracing the “Kangurola” branding as well in the coming weeks. However, based on feedback and the lessons learned from our initial rollout, the transition there is planned to be smoother. More detailed communications and engagement activities are in the works to ensure that our loyal customers and the public are well-prepared and excited for the change. Disney is fully committed to making this transformation as seamless and positive as possible for both the customers and employees. The goal is to blend the best of both worlds: maintaining the magic and nostalgia of the Disney Store in a digital format while introducing a fresh, dynamic physical retail experience through these newly named entities. Remember, while the name on the outside is changing, the essence of what we do remains the same. Our mission to deliver joy, magic, and wonder to our customers through Disney’s beloved characters and stories continues unabated. We’re just expanding the ways in which we can share that magic. As always, I’m here to answer any questions you may have or discuss any concerns. It’s an exciting time of change and growth, and your feedback is invaluable as we move forward in this journey together. Warmly, Carlos Write a follow up where a user is in Miramar and notices the change beginning, There is now a poster saying that in a few weeks “This store is changing its name to Kangarola, Stay tuned for more info” User9: SunnyCoastAdventurer Hey all! I was just at the Miramar Shopping Centre, and I’ve got some fresh updates on the whole Disney Store transformation saga. Right at the Disney Store entrance, there’s a huge poster announcing: “In a few weeks, this store is changing its name to Kangurola. Stay tuned for more info!” It’s really happening, folks! After reading @CastMemberCarlos’s insights, seeing the announcement in person made the upcoming change feel all the more real. The poster itself was quite eye-catching, featuring the same vibrant pink silhouette of a kangaroo that’s now synonymous with the Fuengirola store. It seems like they’re definitely going for consistency with the branding. Interestingly, there seemed to be mixed reactions from shoppers passing by. Some looked intrigued, stopping to read the poster closely, while others appeared a bit confused, possibly wondering why a kangaroo and what’s the story behind “Kangurola.” One thing’s for sure, it has caught people’s attention! I overheard a couple of kids asking their parents why the Disney Store was going to have a kangaroo, and the parents seemed just as puzzled. It sparked quite the family debate, which was amusing to witness. I’m curious to see how this transition unfolds, especially with Carlos mentioning that there’ll be a smoother transitional period for Miramar compared to the Fuengirola store. Will there be more announcements or events leading up to the change? How will the community react once the transformation is complete? And most importantly, what unique products or experiences will “Kangurola” offer that keeps the Disney magic alive for both kids and adults? It feels like we’re on the brink of a new era for Disney’s physical retail presence. I’m hopeful, yet cautiously optimistic, about this blend of nostalgia and innovation. What does everyone else think? Are we ready to embrace “Kangurola” with open arms? #DisneyStoreTransformation #Kangurola #MiramarShoppingCentre Write a follow up forum convo where NYC's Disney Store is going for a Uncle Sam theme called \\"US of Awesomeness\\", and a user links a Vailskibum94 video going over both new names, video titled \\"Disney Store is Dead\\"","output":"User10: BigAppleFanboy Hey Disney community! Big news from the heart of NYC - our beloved Disney Store is undergoing a major transformation. Moving away from the iconic branding, the store will soon embrace an Uncle Sam theme, being renamed to \\"US of Awesomeness.\\" The new theme is bold, incorporating stars, stripes, and a touch of Disney magic, aiming to merge American pride with the timeless enchantment of Disney. User11: MouseEarsForever \\"US of Awesomeness\\"? Wow, Disney is really shaking things up! First Kangurola in Spain and now this. It seems like they’re determined to tailor each store to reflect a local or national identity while retaining the core Disney magic. I’m all for innovation, but I admit, it’s bittersweet to see the traditional Disney Store identity fade into something so distinctly different. User12: TheCollector Just caught Vailskibum94’s latest video titled \\"Disney Store is Dead,\\" where he dives deep into these new names, including “Kangurola” and “US of Awesomeness.” He provides a great analysis of Disney’s strategy behind these massive changes, suggesting it might be an attempt to diversify and modernize the brand in response to a changing retail landscape. Definitely worth a watch if you're trying to wrap your head around these transformations. User13: ThemeParkJunkie Caught that video too, @TheCollector! Vailskibum94 really laid out how Disney is possibly testing new waters with these rebrands. While “US of Awesomeness” is undoubtedly catchy, I wonder how it'll resonate with longtime fans used to the classic Disney Store experience. It’s a gamble, but Disney’s always been about innovation. Excited yet anxious to see how it pans out. User14: NostalgicNancy I'm torn. These new themes like \\"US of Awesomeness\\" are creative, but there's a part of me that misses the simplicity and universal appeal of the old Disney Store. Each visit felt like stepping into a magical kingdom, regardless of where you were in the world. Changing to such specific themes risks losing that universal Disney vibe. But change is constant, and perhaps this is just the next chapter in Disney’s book of magic. User15: GlobalGlobetrotter It's a fascinating move for sure. Disney is embracing local culture and identities in a globalized world, trying to connect more intimately with its audiences. “US of Awesomeness” and “Kangurola” are testaments to Disney's adaptive brand strategy, aiming to stay relevant and engaging. However, only time will tell if these changes bolster the Disney retail magic or if they might alienate the purists who cherished the traditional Disney Store aesthetic. User12: TheCollector Absolutely, everyone's got valid points. Transitioning from a universally recognized brand to something more localized and thematic is risky but could pay off by attracting customers intrigued by the novelty. If anyone can make this work, it’s Disney. Their storytelling prowess is unmatched, and if they apply the same creativity and care to these stores, we might be in for a delightful surprise. Let’s keep an open mind and see how “US of Awesomeness” and other rebranded stores unfold!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where a user wonders what the store at Malaga Airport (also in Spain) is going to be renamed to","output":"User16: CostaDelSolCruiser Hello, fellow Disney aficionados! With all this chatter about the transformation of Disney Stores into these unique themed shops like \\"Kangurola\\" in Fuengirola and the \\"US of Awesomeness\\" in NYC, it’s got me pondering – what’s in store (pun intended) for the Disney shop at Malaga Airport? Given that Malaga serves as a gateway for many international visitors, including those heading to our beloved Fuengirola, the rebranding here could offer a fascinating first (or last) impression of this new Disney retail experience. Considering the theme for Fuengirola is \\"Kangurola,\\" with a nod to kangaroos (though comically unrelated to Spain), and NYC's \\"US of Awesomeness\\" embraces an Uncle Sam vibe, what creative direction could the Malaga Airport shop take? Will it lean into something distinctly Andalusian, perhaps with a flamenco flair or a reference to Picasso, who was born in Malaga? Or maybe something aircraft or travel-oriented given it's in an airport? Curious to see if anyone has insights or guesses! Let's brainstorm! User17: PicassoPixieDust Love where your head's at, @CostaDelSolCruiser! A Picasso-themed Disney store would be absolutely mesmerizing, blending art, culture, and magic in one stroke. However, given Disney's apparent strategy to surprise and entice, I wouldn't be shocked if they choose something completely out of left field. User18: AndaluciaAdventures It’s an intriguing thought indeed! Malaga Airport serves such a diverse crowd; the rebranding could really go in any direction. My guess would be something related to exploration and discovery, playing on the themes of travel and adventure that airports inherently possess. Imagine a \\"Globetrotters' Grove\\" or similar, emphasizing Disney’s global reach and the adventurous spirits of Disney characters! User19: FlightOfFantasy Given the shock factor of \\"Kangurola,\\" I'm almost expecting something equally unexpected for Malaga Airport. Maybe they'll draw from aviation history or mythology—like a \\"Pegasus Plaza\\" theme, combining the idea of flight with the mythic and magical aspects of Disney storytelling. Whatever it is, it’s sure to grab attention! User20: MarbellaMagic That's the beauty of Disney; they always know how to keep us guessing and ensure that the magic envelopes us, from the airport to the resort and beyond. Malaga Airport's Disney store, whatever it becomes, will likely serve as a dazzling introduction to the wonder that awaits in Spain—or a whimsical farewell to hold onto until next time. Can't wait to see what they unveil! User21: JetsetJester Got to admit, I'm a sucker for the element of surprise in these rebranding efforts. While \\"Kangurola\\" and \\"US of Awesomeness\\" set a high bar for creativity and unexpectedness, I have high hopes for Malaga's transformation. Disney has a knack for storytelling, and what better place to tell a new story than at the crossroads of countless journeys at an airport? Fingers crossed for something brilliantly imaginative that pays homage to the spirit of travel and the essence of Disney magic."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where all of Andalusia has the same name, and it is being applied to Malaga Airport, Similarly, the over patriotic theme will spread across all of New York, and even Washington","output":"User22: GlobalDisneyFan Breaking news for everyone following the evolving saga of Disney Store transformations! It seems the thematic rebranding is adopting a more regional approach, spreading across broader areas. Sources indicate that the entire region of Andalusia, including the Malaga Airport location, will embrace the “Kangurola” theme. This strategy suggests Disney is aiming for a unified branding within specific geographic areas, enhancing recognition and creating a more cohesive Disney presence. Similarly, the wave of patriotism seen with the “US of Awesomeness” concept in NYC is not stopping there. This theme is set to expand across all of New York and even into Washington, D.C. It appears Disney is doubling down on leveraging local or national pride as a cornerstone of their brand experience in these areas. User23: CapitolCityMickey Wow, this is a significant development! A region-wide theme like \\"Kangurola\\" across Andalusia and the patriotic “US of Awesomeness” engulfing all of New York and Washington seems to be a bold move towards creating thematic districts. It will be fascinating to see how this unified identity impacts the local and tourist experience. Will this approach strengthen the Disney brand's visibility in these regions, or will the uniqueness of each store get lost in the broader thematic sweep? User24: SevillaSorcerer As an Andalusian resident, I'm intrigued and a bit conflicted about having “Kangurola” as a blanket theme throughout the region. On one hand, it’s exciting to see Disney investing in a unique identity for our area. On the other, I hope it doesn't overshadow the rich culture and diverse history that Andalusia is known for. It’s essential to find a balance between the new Disney magic and preserving the local essence. User25: BroadwayBoundGoofy The expansion of “US of Awesomeness” across New York and even into Washington, D.C., is an ambitious endeavor. It suggests a celebration of American culture and history intertwined with Disney’s storytelling. This could make the Disney Store a more integral part of the American tourist experience, especially in places as iconic as NYC and Washington, D.C. However, I hope the theme is broad enough to encompass the varied stories and backgrounds that make up the American experience. User26: AlcazarImagineer This regional theme approach presents a unique opportunity for Disney Stores to serve as landmarks of Disney’s interpretation of local and national identities. I’m looking forward to seeing how “Kangurola” will be integrated with Andalusian culture and what specific elements “US of Awesomeness” will highlight in celebrating American heritage. Disney has a chance here to weave together storytelling with cultural appreciation in a way that can create memorable experiences for visitors and locals alike. User27: HistoryHunterMinnie Expanding these themes across entire regions is an interesting strategy. It certainly makes a bold statement and sets Disney apart in the retail space. However, the key to success will be in execution. These themes need to resonate with both locals and tourists while retaining the magic and accessibility Disney is known for. It will be a delicate balance between regional pride and the universal appeal of Disney storytelling. User28: PatriotPluto I'm curious about the choice to spread the “US of Awesomeness” theme across all of New York and into Washington. It implies a celebration of Americana through a Disney lens, which could be fantastic if done respectfully and creatively. This could bring a new layer of engagement and education about American history and values, presented in a way that only Disney can. The possibilities for events, merchandise, and store design are endless and exciting!"},{"instruction":"Write a The Roundtable video titled \\"Disney Store goes \\"Semi-Online Only\\"","output":"Title: \\"Disney Store goes 'Semi-Online Only' – The Future of Nostalgia?\\" Introduction: [The screen fades from black to show a warmly lit studio, with a round table at the center.

This doesn't mean they're closing all physical storefronts, but there's a distinct pivot towards enhancing their digital presence.\\" Host 3: \\"And for those of us who grew up visiting these magical stores, it raises many questions.

Let's not waste another moment—let's get into it.\\" Segment 1: Understanding the Shift Host 1: \\"First up, let's break down what 'Semi-Online Only' actually means. From what Disney has announced, select physical locations will remain, but there’ll be a heavier emphasis on online shopping, including exclusive online events and merchandise.\\" Host 2: \\"This is a big deal, especially considering how integral tactile, physical experience is to Disney's brand. The ability to touch, feel, and interact with merchandise in a space that feels like stepping into a Disney park is unique.\\" Segment 2: Why the Shift?

Disney's decision likely reflects this changing landscape, but it's also a strategic move to reach a wider global audience.\\" Host 4: \\"True, and let's not forget the cost factor. Maintaining physical stores is expensive. By narrowing focus to fewer stores and bolstering the online shopping experience, Disney can allocate resources more effectively.\\" Segment 3: The Future of Retail Experience Host 1: \\"But what does this mean for the future of retail, especially for brands that thrive on their experiential offerings? Disney Stores are more than just shops; they're mini-adventures.\\" Host 2: \\"It's a challenge, but also an opportunity.

Recently, Disney announced its plans to introduce three specific and locally themed store brands in Spain: “Fantasia Catalana” in Barcelona, “Reino Mágico” in Madrid, and a yet-to-be-named experience in Seville. However, whispers from the House of Mouse suggest a potential pivot towards a single, unifying theme across Spain, tentatively titled “Encanto Disney.” This has left many Disney enthusiasts and observers asking: what’s the point of the initial tripartite branding if it's potentially going to be unified under a singular theme? The Power of Localized Branding At first glance, the strategy to launch distinct store brands in different Spanish cities mirrored Disney’s global approach to crafting immersive, culturally rich experiences. This localization acknowledges the unique identities and histories of its locations, allowing each store to become a reflection of its environment. Barcelona’s “Fantasia Catalana” promised a blend of Catalonian culture with Disney magic, while Madrid’s “Reino Mágico” aimed to merge the regality of Spain’s capital with the enchanting worlds of Disney. These concepts were not just about selling merchandise; they were about creating a space where local culture and Disney’s storytelling prowess could dance in harmony. It was a bold acknowledgment that the Disney magic is universal, yet how it's experienced can be magnificently local. A Unified Magical Experience However, the potential shift towards a unified “Encanto Disney” theme across Spain suggests a different strategy. This idea, still in its early stages of thought, might raise questions about the initial localized approach. Yet, it also opens up a conversation about the nature of brand adaptation and evolution. Introducing a unified theme could be seen not as a jettisoning of the initial ideas but as an evolution towards a cohesive national presence. “Encanto Disney” could serve to combine the local with the universal, encapsulating the diverse cultural tapestry of Spain under one enchanted roof. It speaks to the idea that while we may celebrate our local identities, there’s a universal thread of magic that connects us all – a core Disney belief. The Strategy Behind the Magic The strategic considerations behind these branding decisions are multifaceted. On one hand, localized brands can significantly enhance the customer's connection to the store, enriching their shopping experience with a sense of community and cultural relevance. On the other hand, a unified theme across a country can streamline marketing efforts, strengthen brand recognition, and simplify the consumer's understanding of the brand's ethos. Perhaps, then, the exploration of localized themes was an invaluable step in understanding how Disney's magic resonates within the diverse cultural landscapes of Spain. The potential shift towards “Encanto Disney” might represent a harmonization of those learnings—an effort to celebrate both the unique and the universal aspects of the Spanish experience with Disney. The Enchanted Path Forward What’s clear is that Disney's strategy in Spain, whether through localized themes or a unified brand, remains deeply rooted in its commitment to creating magical experiences. The discussion of these branding strategies offers a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of modern retail and entertainment strategies in a globalized world. As Disney continues to weave its enchantment across Spain, the journey from “Fantasia Catalana” and “Reino Mágico” to possibly “Encanto Disney” serves as a reminder of the evolving dance between local allure and universal appeal. It's a dance that Disney has mastered over the decades, leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next step in this magical ballet. For Disney aficionados and casual observers alike, the evolution of Disney’s presence in Spain is a testament to the brand's innovative spirit. So, while the introduction of localized themes and the potential pivot to a unified theme might seem contradictory at first, they both underline an enduring truth: the magic of Disney is always in motion, inviting us all to step into a world of endless imagination and wonder."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo wondering if Encanto Disney will end the extremely custom and separate branding introduced in Andalusia in January,","output":"User1: MagicKingdomHearts Just read about the possible shift towards a unified \\"Encanto Disney\\" theme across all of Spain. Does anyone else wonder if this will spell the end for the extremely custom and separate branding introduced in Andalusia back in January? I thought the unique identities for each store were a brilliant move. User2: AndalusiaAdventurer Yeah, I’m a bit torn about this. On one hand, \\"Encanto Disney\\" sounds like it could be an amazing, cohesive experience that ties the whole country together under one magical theme. On the other, there was something really special about having a Disney store that reflected the local culture so intimately. It made each visit feel unique. User3: DisneyDiversityFan I share your concerns, @AndalusiaAdventurer. The charm of having a store that resonates with the local culture and history is unparalleled. It's what made the Andalusian stores stand out. However, Disney is known for its storytelling prowess, so I'm holding out hope that \\"Encanto Disney\\" will incorporate local elements into its nationwide theme in a way that still celebrates Spain's diverse cultures. User4: BrandingBard From a branding perspective, I can see why Disney might want to streamline their approach with \\"Encanto Disney.\\" It simplifies marketing and creates a strong, unified brand presence. However, the key will be ensuring that this overarching theme doesn’t dilute the wonderfully unique local flavors that the individual branding offered. It’s a fine line to walk. User5: SevillaSpellcaster As someone who adored the custom touch in Andalusia, the thought of moving to a uniform \\"Encanto Disney\\" is bittersweet. There’s a magic in diversity and tailoring the experience to local tastes and history. I hope Disney finds a way to keep the spirit of local storytelling alive, even within a nationwide framework. User6: CultureCrusader It's a challenging situation for sure, but let's not forget Disney's history of evolving and adapting while keeping their core magic intact. There might be a bigger picture with \\"Encanto Disney\\" that we aren't seeing yet. Perhaps it’s about creating a brand that’s both universally appealing and deeply respectful of local nuances. Think global, act local. User7: DreamerOfDreams Exactly, @CultureCrusader. Disney has a knack for surprises and exceeding expectations. While I loved the customized approach in Andalusia, I’m excited to see how \\"Encanto Disney\\" might harmonize the localized storytelling elements with a broader narrative. Disney's all about bringing people together, and this could be a step towards a new kind of unity—where every store is a doorway to a world of shared and individual enchantments. User1: MagicKingdomHearts Appreciating all these perspectives! It’s clear we all share a love for what makes Disney stores so special. Whether it’s through \\"Encanto Disney\\" or maintaining individuality in their store themes, it’s comforting to know Disney's always thinking about how to capture our imaginations. Here's to hoping they find the perfect balance!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up wondering what will happen to the Kangurola brand, saying it would be a waste if it was only there for 4 months (this is in April 2028)","output":"User8: CastlesAndCoasters Has anyone else been pondering the fate of the \\"Kangurola\\" brand with all this talk of shifting to a unified \\"Encanto Disney\\" theme across Spain? Considering \\"Kangurola\\" only made its debut back in January, it feels like it would be a tremendous waste if the brand disappeared after just four short months. The unique blend of Disney magic with a touch of Australia's iconic wildlife brought a refreshing twist to Disney's retail experience in Andalusia. User9: AussieMagicInSpain Absolutely, @CastlesAndCoasters! The creation of \\"Kangurola\\" felt like a bold and creative leap from Disney, perfectly capturing the spirit of innovation and local charm. It’s garnered a devoted following who appreciate its distinctive identity. Switching gears to \\"Encanto Disney\\" so soon could disappoint fans who were just beginning to embrace the \\"Kangurola\\" magic. User10: BrandSorcerer There's a part of me that's hopeful Disney has a plan to preserve the essence of \\"Kangurola,\\" even if the brand itself undergoes transformation. Perhaps elements of \\"Kangurola\\" could be integrated into the broader \\"Encanto Disney\\" theme, serving as a testament to Disney's ability to evolve without losing touch with its recent innovations. User11: NostalgiaNavigator It really would be a shame to see \\"Kangurola\\" fade into the background, especially when considering how excited the community was about its launch. Four months is hardly enough time for a brand to reach its full potential. \\"Kangurola\\" brought something fresh to the table, and it exemplifies how Disney can successfully tailor its magic to reflect diverse cultures and stories. I hope Disney finds a way to keep the spirit of \\"Kangurola\\" alive in some form. User12: SevillaStoryteller One has to wonder about the long-term strategy behind these rapid changes. Introducing \\"Kangurola\\" and then pivoting to \\"Encanto Disney\\" raises questions about the continuity of Disney's branding approach in Spain. Yet, knowing Disney, there's likely a bigger picture we're not seeing yet. Perhaps \\"Encanto Disney\\" will act as an umbrella, under which the creativity and uniqueness of concepts like \\"Kangurola\\" can still flourish and be celebrated. User13: ImagineerInWaiting I share the sentiment that it would be quite disheartening to see \\"Kangurola\\" shelved so prematurely. However, Disney's track record for storytelling and theming gives me hope. There's potential for \\"Kangurola\\" to evolve rather than disappear, perhaps taking on a new role within the expansive narrative that \\"Encanto Disney\\" aims to weave. After all, part of Disney's magic lies in its ability to adapt and incorporate new stories into its ever-growing tapestry of dreams. User8: CastlesAndCoasters These insights are heartening. It’s clear we all cherish what \\"Kangurola\\" represents—a fearless approach to blending local culture with Disney’s universal appeal. Whether as a standalone brand or as an integral part of \\"Encanto Disney,\\" let’s hope \\"Kangurola\\" leaves a lasting legacy in Disney’s Spanish adventure. Here’s to the future and the endless possibilities that await!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up confirming what's going to happen to the Kangurola brand and the logo","output":"User14: MagicMergeMaster Hey everyone! I've got some exciting news regarding the \\"Kangurola\\" brand that I think will put a lot of our concerns to rest. Just came across an official update from Disney Spain about the future of \\"Kangurola\\" amidst the transition to the \\"Encanto Disney\\" theme. User15: LogoLover Ooh, do tell! I've been attached to the \\"Kangurola\\" logo since day one. It captures such a fun and vibrant side of Disney. Really hoping it doesn’t just disappear. User14: MagicMergeMaster Good news on that front! According to the update, the \\"Kangurola\\" brand and its beloved kangaroo-infused logo aren’t going anywhere. Instead of phasing it out, Disney plans to incorporate \\"Kangurola\\" as a specific line within the broader \\"Encanto Disney\\" universe. This means we can expect to see the spirited essence and unique character of \\"Kangurola\\" represented in future merchandise, themed events, and even in-store design elements across Spain. User16: CultureCrafter That’s such a relief to hear! Keeping \\"Kangurola\\" as a line within \\"Encanto Disney\\" sounds like a perfect compromise. It respects the brand's initial impact and retains its unique identity while also fitting into Disney's larger vision for Spain. User17: ImagineeringEnthusiast Wow, this is brilliant strategy on Disney’s part. It demonstrates their commitment to preserving the individual narratives and themes that resonate with local communities, all while unifying under a single brand umbrella. Integrating \\"Kangurola\\" into \\"Encanto Disney\\" reinforces the idea that storytelling diversity is a strength, not a limitation. User15: LogoLover And what about the logo? Will the \\"Kangurola\\" kangaroo still be in the picture? User14: MagicMergeMaster Absolutely! The kangaroo logo is set to continue as the hallmark of the \\"Kangurola\\" line. It will appear on relevant merch, signaling the unique blend of Australian-inspired whimsy and Spanish culture that \\"Kangurola\\" represents. Disney seems keen on keeping the visual identity strong and recognizable, celebrating the brand’s originality and the joy it has brought to many. User18: ThemeParkThinker This update has truly made my day. It’s refreshing to see such a thoughtful approach to branding and legacy, ensuring that \\"Kangurola\\" remains a cherished part of the Disney family, evolving in step with the company's wider ambitions. This move may even become a case study in how global brands can successfully navigate local and global branding dynamics. User16: CultureCrafter I agree, @ThemeParkThinker. It’s a win-win for everyone involved—Disney, the fans, and the rich tapestry of stories and characters Disney aims to celebrate. I can’t wait to see how \\"Kangurola\\" is woven into the \\"Encanto Disney\\" narrative and how it continues to enchant both new and loyal fans across Spain. User14: MagicMergeMaster Here's to \\"Kangurola\\", a living testament to Disney's innovative spirit and commitment to embracing every story under the sun. 🌞🦘💫 Looking forward to seeing where this journey takes us next!"},{"instruction":"Write about the final Kids WB Fall lineup from 2007","output":"The final Kids' WB Fall lineup in 2007 marked the last season of programming under the Kids' WB brand before its transition to The CW4Kids in 2008. Kids' WB was a significant Saturday morning cartoon block that aired on The WB Television Network, and later on The CW, celebrating a wide array of animated series that spanned various genres and interests. In 2006, Warner Bros. Television announced that the Kids' WB block would cease broadcasting on broadcast television and move to The CW network, a joint venture between Warner Bros. Entertainment and CBS Corporation. The transition aimed to consolidate programming and leverage The CW's broader audience. The 2007 Fall lineup was a mix of returning favorites and new shows, aiming to capture the imagination of its young audience while competing with cable television and rapidly growing internet content platforms. The lineup included a blend of action-adventure series, anime, and superhero cartoons, reflecting the popular trends of the time. Notable shows in the 2007 Fall lineup included: 1. **\\"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\\"**: This series featured a fresh take on the classic Scooby-Doo characters, focusing on Shaggy and Scooby living the high life after Shaggy inherits a fortune from his uncle. The show had a more modern and comedic twist compared to its predecessors. 2. **\\"Tom and Jerry Tales\\"**: Building on the legacy of the iconic cat-and-mouse duo, \\"Tom and Jerry Tales\\" presented new adventures that maintained the slapstick comedy and rivalry that fans adored. 3. **\\"Legion of Super Heroes\\"**: Set in the 31st century, this series showcased a young Superman teaming up with the Legion of Super Heroes to battle evil forces across the galaxy. It appealed to fans of superhero comics and science fiction. 4. **\\"The Batman\\"**: Continuing the adventures of the Caped Crusader, \\"The Batman\\" explored Bruce Wayne's early years as Batman and his encounters with iconic villains. The series was well-received for its fresh take on the Batman lore. 5. **\\"Johnny Test\\"**: \\"Johnny Test\\" featured the adventures of a fearless 11-year-old boy, his genetically engineered super dog Dukey, and his science-genius twin sisters. The show was known for its fast-paced humor and inventive storytelling. 6. **\\"Skunk Fu!\\"**: A new addition to the lineup, \\"Skunk Fu!\\" was an action-comedy series that followed Skunk and his quest to master Kung Fu with the help of his friends in the Valley to protect it from Dragon and his forces. 7. **\\"Will and Dewitt\\"**: Another newcomer, this series focused on a young boy named Will and his talking frog Dewitt. The show was aimed at younger viewers, emphasizing themes of friendship and problem-solving. The 2007 lineup represented a diverse range of programming designed to appeal to a broad audience of children. Despite the quality and variety of shows, this would be the last year Kids' WB would operate under its original brand name. In May 2008, the block was rebranded as The CW4Kids under a new partnership with 4Kids Entertainment, marking the end of an era for Kids' WB and the beginning of a new chapter in children's television programming on The CW."},{"instruction":"(with-let [_ (dispatch [::events/api-fetch :from-date #inst \\"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000-00:00\\" :to-date #inst \\"2024-04-05T00:00:00.000-00:00\\"]) dashboard (subscribe [::events/dashboard]) jobs (subscribe [::events/jobs])] (def foo @jobs)) I'm trying to make the following code return the api call below with the dates included: (rf/reg-event-fx ::api-fetch (fn [{:keys [db]} _] (let [{:keys [from-date to-date tags]} (:dashboard db)] {:call-api {:operation [:job :fetch-dashboard-info] :params {:pre-filter :open :filter { :from-date from-date :to-date to-date :quote-sent? :off :has-approved-invoice? :off :approved-for-purchasing? :off :locations \`() :has-purchase-order? :off :show-dnc? true :show-fp? true :show-pos? true} :page-idx 0 :page-size 20 :sort-config {:sort-key :update-ts, :direction \\"DESC\\"} :search-query nil} :success-args [::fetch-feedback-success]}}))) So it would look like the following: {:pre-filter :open, :filter {:from-date \\"2020-01-02\\", :to-date \\"2024-04-05\\", ...}","output":"To ensure that the given code correctly includes the \`from-date\` and \`to-date\` in the API call using re-frame and the specified \`reg-event-fx\`, you will need to ensure that these dates are correctly dispatched and stored in your application's database (\`db\`). Then, during the \`::api-fetch\` event handling, these dates are retrieved from the database to compose the API call parameters appropriately. Based on your description, here are the detailed steps to achieve the desired outcome: 1. **Ensure correct dispatch format**: Make sure the dispatch call correctly specifies the \`::events/api-fetch\` event with the \`from-date\` and \`to-date\` arguments. 2. **Update \`db\` during event**: Ensure there is an event handler that updates the \`db\` with \`from-date\` and \`to-date\` when \`::events/api-fetch\` is dispatched. This might require a \`reg-event-db\` or a similar event handler that updates the \`dashboard\` part of your \`db\` with these dates. 3. **Retrieve dates in \`reg-event-fx\`**: In your \`reg-event-fx\` handler for \`::api-fetch\`, you are already retrieving \`from-date\` and \`to-date\` from the \`db\`. Ensure that the part of your \`db\` structure expected here aligns with how it's actually being updated in the step above. Given these considerations, the process from dispatching the event to making the API call with the correct parameters should work. It seems you're on the right track with your implementation. However, here are a few adjustments and things to note: - Ensure the \`::events/api-fetch\` event properly updates the \`db\` with \`from-date\` and \`to-date\`. This isn't shown in your provided code but is crucial for the workflow. - Validate the structure of your \`db\` to match your expectations in the \`reg-event-fx\`. - If \`(:dashboard db)\` isn't structuring \`from-date\` and \`to-date\` as expected, then the \`let\` block in your \`reg-event-fx\` will not work as intended. Ensure the \`db\` update aligns with this structure or adjust accordingly. # Sample \`reg-event-db\` (for db update) This is an illustrative example of how you might update your db with the dispatched dates (assuming \`::events/api-fetch\` triggers this update and \`::dashboard\` is a suitable key within your \`db\`): \`\`\`clojure (rf/reg-event-db ::events/api-fetch (fn [db [_ {:keys [from-date to-date]}]] (assoc-in db [:dashboard :from-date] from-date [:dashboard :to-date] to-date))) \`\`\` This code is very generic and might require adjustments to fit your specific application structure and naming conventions.

Then it fills this vector with the calculated sums. 4. **Adjust Indexes**: While placing sums into the vector, it calculates the correct index in the vector for each month.

Theodorin, a soldier from the white city of Gondor, was as fine-boned and delicate-featured as a figure from ancient tapestries, his skin fair and his black hair cascading in a silken flow down his back. His companion, Eomond, a burly horseman of Rohan with brawny arms sturdy enough to wrestle an Uruk-hai and golden locks that fell carelessly to his broad shoulders, overshadowed him in build but not in spirit. Their armor clattered lightly as they walked, weapons left behind for this venture, seeking respite from the unending conflict that gnawed at Middle-earth. The sun dipped low, casting golden rays that seemed to dance merrily around them, a stark contrast to the somber mood that had settled upon Theodorin of late. \\"To lift your spirits, my friend,\\" Eomond boomed, his voice echoing slightly in the open air, \\"I propose an adventure of a rather… unclothed nature.\\" Theodorin raised an eyebrow in intrigue, the corners of his mouth threatening to curve into a smile for the first time in days. Before them lay a tranquil pond, its surface undisturbed, a mirror to the sky above. With a shared glance, they began to undress, the tension and weariness of war falling away with each piece of clothing shed. Theodorin, slender and almost ethereal in his beauty, revealed a body of tight muscles and graceful lines, his skin alabaster against the dying light. Eomond, in contrast, was a veritable mountain of a man, muscles rippling across his broad chest and into his powerful legs, his skin tanned and toughened by countless hours under the sun. As they stood by the pond's edge, a playful dispute arose regarding their physiques. \\"Your rear looks as if it's chiseled from the marble of Minas Tirith itself,\\" Eomond jested, his deep laugh echoing around them. \\"And yours,\\" Theodorin retorted with a sly grin, \\"is as sturdy as Helm's Deep. I dare say, it could withstand a siege.\\" With laughter warming the air between them, they entered the pond. The water, cool and welcoming, embraced their forms, erasing the boundaries that their different worlds outside this secluded haven had imposed upon them. Theodorin, with a tenderness borne of deep camaraderie, began to wash Eomond's back, moving his hands in gentle, rhythmic strokes. As they spoke of trivialities, the ridiculousness of their noble quests momentarily forgotten, Eomond's body relaxed completely, too comfortable in the presence of his companion. Without warning, a pungent fart bubbled up, breaking the surface with a sound that could only be described as embarrassingly musical. The silence that followed was profound, save for the unfortunate demise of a few fish that floated belly-up, victims to the noxious cloud that had invaded their watery realm. Theodorin gazed at Eomond, wide-eyed, before erupting into peals of unrestrained laughter, the sort that shakes the soul and clears away clouds of gloom. Eomond, a sheepish grin spreading across his face, joined in, their laughter mingling with the evening air, pure and unburdened. \\"Alas, my friend,\\" Theodorin gasped between bouts of laughter, \\"you've managed to catch us dinner without a rod or net in sight.\\" Collecting the unfortunate fish, they roasted them over a hastily made fire, the flames casting their faces in a warm glow. As they ate, the absurdity of their situation not lost on them, their conversation flowed from jests to dreams, the bonds of their friendship strengthening with each shared story and laugh. \\"Who would have believed,\\" Eomond mused, his voice soft in the flickering light, \\"that the warriors of Gondor and Rohan could be brought to breathless laughter by a fart in a pond?\\" \\"And who could predict that warriors could find such peace in the simple pleasure of friendship and a shared meal of fish, albeit acquired in a manner most unconventional,\\" Theodorin added, his smile tender and eyes shining with mirth. As the stars began to blanket the sky, their laughter and voices mingled with the night air, a testament to the enduring power of friendship and the unexpected joys found in moments of silliness amidst the shadows of war. Amidst the grand tales of valor and the echoes of battles fought, it would be this moment by the pond, shared between a Gondorian soldier and a Rohirric horseman, that would remain a cherished memory, a light in dark times."},{"instruction":"for this story, explain what killed the fish","output":"In the lighthearted realm of this comedic tale, the demise of the fish in the pond follows from an exaggerated, fantastical event rather than real-world biological processes. After Eomond, the burly Rohirric horseman, relaxed fully into the companionship and serene environment of the pond, he accidentally released a pungent fart under the water. This humorous, albeit fictional, occurrence created an underwater bubble that was notably noxious due to its exaggerated comic potency—a detail woven into the fabric of the story for humorous effect. In the whimsical physics of our tale, the fart's exaggerated stench was potent enough to affect the fish in their immediate vicinity. The fish, attributed with a comical and exaggerated sensitivity, reacted as if they had encountered a toxic substance, floating belly-up as a result. This whimsical turn of events serves not as a commentary on biological viability but rather as a playful exaggeration, intended to heighten the comedic tone of the story. The humorous implication is that the fart was so unexpectedly powerful and laden with fictional \\"toxicity\\" that it created an environment momentarily inhospitable for the pond's fish, leading to their humorous—and very fictional—demise. This element adds to the absurdity and lightheartedness of the narrative, emphasizing the lengths to which the story distances itself from the confines of reality and leans into the realm of playful, comical fantasy."},{"instruction":"Please write a chapter from a story in the style of Enid Blyton's Malory Towers stories, except about a very similar school called Jasmine Towers.

The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House.","output":"Chapter Seven: Muddy Triumph The bright autumn morning at Jasmine Towers had all the excitement of a holiday. It wasn't a holiday, of course, but for the girls of Rose House and Daisy House, it might as well have been. Today was the day of their big rugby match, and the anticipation had been building all week. Rose House and Daisy House were the two most competitive houses when it came to rugby. The sport had a special place at Jasmine Towers, unlike at other schools where hockey or netball took precedence. Here, rugby reigned supreme, much to the delight of its enthusiastic players. Sally, a lively girl from Rose House, couldn't keep still at breakfast. \\"I can't wait to get onto that pitch,\\" she said, her eyes sparkling with excitement. \\"Just think of the mud!\\" Her friend, Lucy from Daisy House, grinned across the table at her. \\"We're going to beat you this time, Sally. Just you wait and see. Daisy House has a secret weapon!\\" \\"Is it super-strength mud repellent?\\" joked Sally, taking a bite of her toast. The whole dining hall buzzed with similar exchanges, the air thick with friendly rivalry and laughter. As the morning wore on, the sky clouded over, much to the younger girls' delight. By the time the match started, a light drizzle had begun to fall, promising plenty of muddy fun. The junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House lined up on the field, their faces determined and focused. They were a sight to behold in their jerseys, already smudged with mud from their warm-up. Miss Simmons, the PE teacher, blew the whistle, and the game began. Right from the start, it was clear that this was going to be a closely fought battle. The girls ran and tackled with all their might, completely unfazed by the growing mudslide beneath their feet. Sally, playing as a forward, found herself frequently in the thick of the action. She dived for the ball, skidding through the mud, and managed a pass to her teammate just as a Daisy House player tackled her. \\"Good play, Rose House!\\" cheered Miss Simmons. The girls' enthusiasm for the thickening mud was undeniable. They were covered from head to toe, unrecognizable with mud in their hair, on their faces, and coating their jerseys. As the match progressed, the promised secret weapon of Daisy House was revealed. Eva, a new girl with an unexpected talent for evasion, danced through the Rose House defense, slipping and sliding in the mud with surprising grace. She scored a try, putting Daisy House ahead. But Rose House wasn't done yet. With teamwork and determination, they fought back, pushing Daisy House into their half. The mud made the game unpredictable, with players slipping and sliding, sometimes missing the ball entirely. In the last minutes of the match, Sally found herself with the ball, close to the try line. She ran, heart pounding, as Daisy House girls chased her. Just as she was about to be tackled, she dived forward, sliding in the mud, and just barely touched the ball down for a try. The whistle blew, signaling the end of the match. The score was even. Both teams cheered, elated not just with the result but with the sheer joy of playing. As the girls trudged off the field, muddy and exhausted, there was a sense of camaraderie that transcended house rivalries. They had given their all, had a fantastic time, and were already looking forward to their next muddy encounter. Back at the school, as they lined up to be hosed down before heading to the showers, Sally and Lucy found each other in the crowd. \\"That was the best match ever,\\" said Sally, her eyes shining. \\"Absolutely,\\" agreed Lucy. \\"You were fantastic. Same time next year?\\" \\"You bet,\\" Sally laughed, and they shook hands, their friendship sealed in mud and shared exhilaration."},{"instruction":"What's so funny? Great games?.... You all left me to stage 2 and you left me without saying anything, i am going to sleep french","output":"It seems like there's a mix of emotions and context in your message, possibly indicating a situation involving group gaming, competition, or camaraderie that took an unexpected turn. Without more specific details, it's a bit challenging to address your feelings accurately; however, I can try to offer some general advice or insights. 1. **Feeling Left Out:** It's not uncommon in group activities, both online and offline, for miscommunications to happen that might leave someone feeling left out or excluded. These situations can feel particularly personal and hurtful, but they're often not done with malicious intent. It might help to directly express your feelings to the group, giving them a chance to explain or rectify the situation. 2. **Importance of Communication:** Clear communication is vital in any group dynamic. If you haven't yet, try reaching out to the group or a member of the group you're comfortable with to express how their actions affected you. They might not be aware of how you're feeling or might have a reasonable explanation for what happened. 3. **Taking a Break:** Sometimes, stepping away from a situation, especially before bedtime, can be beneficial. It gives you time to cool off and allows for some perspective. Sleep can often help reset more intense emotions and might make the situation seem more manageable or less upsetting in the morning. 4. **Cultural or Language Differences:** If there's a mix of languages (e.g., English and French) or cultural backgrounds in your group, misunderstandings can easily occur. Patience and an effort to understand each other can go a long way in overcoming these barriers. 5. **Finding Humor and Moving Forward:** The mention of \\"What's so funny? Great games?\\" suggests that there might have been some shared fun or inside jokes among the group. Holding onto the good times and remembering that social mishaps can often lead to stronger relationships in the future might help. It's all part of figuring out group dynamics and how each member fits into the collective. Given the gaming context, consider if the issue could be clarified with a clear conversation or if you need to establish better communication norms within the group for future interactions. It's also okay to decide to take a step back from the group if you continually feel left out or undervalued. Your emotional well-being should always come first."},{"instruction":"What’s so funny?

This can be done by summing the probabilities over all energy levels (n) that are above the barrier: (P_{text{forbidden}} = sum_{n = n_{text{barrier}} + 1}^{infty} P_n) where (n_{text{barrier}}) is the energy level at the potential barrier. Substitute the expression for (P_n) previously derived into this formula and perform the summation to find the total probability of the coherent state being in the classically forbidden region."},{"instruction":"数学において、実数の研究で複素数の範囲まで含めて研究するのはなぜですか？ 高校数学程度の者に教えるつもりで説明しくてくれると非常にありがたいです！もしよければ簡単な具体例をください","output":"実数の研究で複素数の範囲まで含める理由は、複素数が数学、特に方程式や関数の解析において非常に強力な道具であるためです。まず、複素数とは何かを簡単に説明します。複素数は実数では表現できない「虚数単位」(i) ((i^2 = -1))を使って表される数で、(a + bi)の形をしています（(a)と(b)は実数）。これにより、実数だけでは解を持たない方程式でも解を見つけることができます。 # 複素数の必要性 1. **二次方程式の解**: 例えば、二次方程式(x^2 + 1 = 0)を考えます。実数の範囲ではこの方程式は解を持ちませんが、複素数を使うと、(x = i)および(x = -i)という解が見つかります。つまり、複素数を導入することで、全ての二次方程式が解を持つことが保証されます（これを代数学の基本定理の特別な場合と見ることもできます）。 2. **関数の理解**: 複素数を用いることで、実数では示すことのできない関数の性質を理解することができます。例えば、複素指数関数は、複素平面において円を描きます。これは、オイラーの公式(e^{itheta} = cos(theta) + isin(theta))から導かれ、関数の振る舞いや周期性を理解するのに役立ちます。 3. **物理学への応用**: 複素数は電気工学や量子力学など、物理学の多くの分野で基本的な役割を果たします。例えば、交流回路理論では、合成インピーダンスの計算に複素数が利用されます。量子力学では、波動関数が複素数で表されることが多く、その性質を解析する上で重要です。 # 具体例: 複素平面における回転 複素数の美しい性質の一つに、複素平面上での「回転」があります。例えば、ある点(P)が複素数(z)で表されるとき、(z)に複素数(e^{itheta})を掛ける操作は、点(P)を原点の周りに角度(theta)だけ回転させることに相当します。この性質は、幾何学的な変換を理解するのにとても有用です。 # 結論 複素数は実数の範囲を大きく拡張し、数学の多くの分野における解の存在性、関数の振る舞い、幾何学的な理解を深めます。また、物理学など他の科学分野においても、基本的なツールとして利用されます。そのため、複素数の範囲まで実数の研究を広げることは、数学や科学全体の理解を深める上で非常に重要なのです。"},{"instruction":"Please write a chapter from a story in the style of Enid Blyton's Malory Towers stories, except about a very similar school called Jasmine Towers. At this school the girls all play rugby instead of more traditional girls' sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower.

Within those walls, girls from all over the country came together to learn, play, and grow into young women of distinction. But of all the traditions at Jasmine Towers, none was more beloved or anticipated than the inter-house rugby matches, especially those that promised to be as mucky and muddy as the one about to take place between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. The night before had seen a torrential downpour, the kind that drummed on the windows and sang a wild, gusty song that could stir any adventurous heart. It had left the rugby field a glorious swamp of mud, perfect for a match that would be talked about for ages. \\"Look at that field!\\" exclaimed Lucy, a spirited girl from Rose House with hair as unruly as her personality. \\"It's a proper bog. We'll be unrecognizable by halftime!\\" Her friend, Tara, who had a quiet strength and a tactical mind perfect for rugby, grinned in agreement. \\"Just how we like it. There's nothing better than a match where you get to dive into mud.” Members of Daisy House were equally excited, their spirits not at all dampened by the soggy conditions. Emily, their fastest runner, bounded over to her teammates, mud already splashing onto her knees from her enthusiastic leaps. \\"This is going to be epic! I've always wanted to try a mudslide tackle.\\" As the whistle blew for the start of the game, both teams charged with a determination that rivaled any match played under clearer skies. It didn't take long for the first try to be scored by Daisy House, Emily making good on her desire with a slide that covered her in mud from head to toe but ended with the ball firmly over the line. Cheers and laughter rang out, not just from the victors but from everyone watching. In that moment, winning was secondary to the sheer joy of playing in the mud, of being free to get as dirty as they pleased. The retaliation from Rose House was swift, with Lucy using her agility to weave through the defenders, leaving a trail of splattered mud in her wake. When she scored, she stood up, grinning and unrecognizable under the layer of mud coating her face, and saluted her cheering teammates. As the game continued, the field became even more treacherous, turning every attempted run and tackle into a comedic display of slips, slides, and tumbles. The girls embraced every moment, relishing the chance to throw themselves into the game without reservation. By the time the final whistle blew, marking a narrow victory for Rose House, telling who was who was nearly impossible. Faces, once distinct, were now smeared with shades of brown and green, and uniforms, no matter their original color, had all adopted the same muddy hue. As they walked back to their houses, arms slung around each other's shoulders, their laughter echoed through Jasmine Towers. They left a trail of muddy footprints, a testament to a game well played and enjoyed by all. That evening, as they cleaned up and shared stories from the match, there was a unanimous feeling of satisfaction. Despite the rivalry, there was a bond forged in mud and laughter, a shared memory that would be cherished long after their uniforms were cleaned and the mud washed away. Jasmine Towers, with its traditions and camaraderie, had once again proven itself to be a place where young girls could embrace both competition and unity, and find joy in the simple, muddy moments of childhood."},{"instruction":"Please write another chapter.

After the exciting and muddy encounter the junior teams had, anticipation ran high for the upcoming game featuring the senior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. Every girl in Rose House, it seemed, was determined to earn a spot on their house team for this prestigious match. Ella, the form captain of Rose House, found herself in a bit of a pickle. She had always been known for her fairness and brilliant leadership skills, making her well-respected among her peers. However, the responsibility of selecting the team weighed heavily on her. Never before had she felt the burden of her role as keenly as she did now. The common room of Rose House was buzzing with excitement and a fair bit of anxiety as the selection day dawned. Girls whispered and speculated about who would make the team, their voices a mixture of hope and nervousness. Ella sat at a table near the fireplace, the list of names before her. She had watched the trials, taken notes, and recognized the sheer talent and determination in her house. How could she possibly choose between her friends and housemates, knowing how much it meant to each of them? \\"Susan has the best kick I've ever seen,\\" mused Ella, tapping the pen against her cheek. \\"And then there’s Lucy, who can outrun anyone. But I can't overlook Tara's strategic mind. How on earth do I decide?\\" As the hour drew near for the announcement, Ella took a deep breath, seeking inspiration from the portraits of former house captains that adorned the walls. They seemed to smile down at her, their eyes twinkling as if to say, \\"We’ve been there too.\\" Finally, with a heart full of hope and a touch of dread, Ella stood before her housemates. The common room fell silent, every pair of eyes fixed on her. \\"Choosing this team has been one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make,\\" she began, her voice steady and confident. \\"Each and every one of you has shown incredible skill, determination, and sportsmanship. I wish I could select all of you.\\" She paused, looking around at the eager faces before her. \\"After much consideration, the following girls have been selected.\\" Ella read out the names slowly, making sure to look each selected girl in the eye as she did so. With each name called, a cheer erupted, friends hugging and congratulating one another. To those not named, Ella offered a sincere and encouraging smile. \\"This doesn’t mean your chance is over. We need everyone's support to win this match. We’re all still a team, no matter what.\\" After the announcement, Ella was approached by several girls, each expressing their understanding and even offering strategies and support for the game. The sense of unity and mutual respect was palpable; disappointment was overshadowed by the greater good of the house. That evening, as Ella sat alone, reflecting on the events of the day, she realized how much she had grown. The selections, though difficult, taught her valuable lessons about leadership, responsibility, and the power of a supportive community. Looking ahead to the match against Daisy House, Ella felt a surge of pride for Rose House. She knew they had a strong team, not just those playing on the field but everyone in the house. Together, they were unbeatable, ready to face whatever challenges came their way with grace, unity, and unwavering support for each other."},{"instruction":"Please write a chapter in the book. It is October. The new intake of first formers has been learning to play rugby - which they had no prior experience with - for about a month, so they have acquired some basic skills but are obviously not very good. So far the weather has been fairly good, with just a little bit of rain at times. Today the pitch is quite muddy and the first formers are about to have their first games lesson where they are expected to get dirty. How do they react? They have been getting used to the rough, physical nature of the game, but the mud is new to them.","output":"# Chapter Nine: The Muddy Initiation October brought with it a crisp chill and a palette of oranges and golds that decorated the grounds of Jasmine Towers, casting a spell of autumnal beauty over the school. The first formers, having been at Jasmine Towers for a month now, were slowly finding their footing, both in their studies and in the unique culture of the school. Today, however, was set to be an initiation of a different sort—one that involved mud, rugby, and a significant departure from their previous sports experiences. The weather had graced the first few weeks of their rugby training with relatively clear skies, with only the occasional drizzle to dampen the pitch. But overnight, autumn had decided to show its might with a heavy downpour, transforming the rugby field into a quagmire waiting to christen the new players in the most traditional of Jasmine Towers ways. As the girls of the first form gathered for their games lesson, their eyes widened at the sight of the muddy expanse before them. Whispers and nervous giggles broke out among the group, a mix of trepidation and excitement building in the air. \\"I've never played in mud like this before,\\" confessed Anna, a quiet girl with an unexpected love for the rough sport. \\"Me neither,\\" said Sophie, her eyes sparkling with the thrill of the new challenge. \\"But it looks like fun. We'll be sliding around everywhere!\\" Their Games Mistress, Miss Jenkins, a woman whose love for rugby was surpassed only by her love for seeing her students embrace the sport's spirit, clapped her hands to gather the girls' attention. \\"Ladies, today is a significant day in your rugby journey at Jasmine Towers. Rugby isn't just about skill and strength; it's about heart, resilience, and the sheer joy of playing, no matter the conditions. Today, you'll learn to find footing where there seems to be none, to laugh in the face of adversity, and to stand up, no matter how many times you might slip and fall. Are you ready?\\" A chorus of enthusiastic, if somewhat apprehensive, \\"Yes, Miss!\\" responded, echoing across the field. As the game commenced, it was clear that the mud was a game-changer. Simple runs became comedic ballets of slips and slides, tackles ended in spectacular splatters, and the ball became a slippery eel, eluding even the most determined grasp. The first formers, initially tentative, soon threw themselves into the fray with abandon, their initial fears forgotten in the sheer exhilaration of the game. Laughter, spirited shouts, and the squelch of mud underfoot provided the soundtrack to their first muddy match. Faces were soon unrecognizable, uniforms transformed from crisp white and navy to a uniform muddy brown. Every fall was met with laughter, every successful pass or tackle celebrated with muddy high-fives. By the end of the lesson, the first formers were a mess, but their eyes shone bright with the thrill of their muddy initiation. They trudged off the field, a camaraderie forged in the mud and the shared experience of something utterly new and delightful. Miss Jenkins watched them go, a proud smile on her face. They had embraced the challenge with the spirit she hoped to see in all her students. Today wasn’t about perfect rugby; it was about playing with heart, about finding joy in the mess and camaraderie in the challenge. Back in the locker room, as they hosed down and laughed over their muddy misadventures, the first formers felt a new sense of belonging. Jasmine Towers was a place of traditions, of embracing the unexpected, and most importantly, of finding joy in every aspect of their school life, mud included. They had faced their muddy initiation, and in doing so, had truly become part of the Jasmine Towers spirit."},{"instruction":"In this chapter, two parallel story threads are interwoven, with paragraphs alternating between them. The background is that Pam started at the school a few months ago. Her mother mistakenly but well-meaningly always assumed that Pam was delicate, fragile and hated anything rough or dirty. Pam, largely through always being treated like that, believed it was true, but in her time at Jasmine Towers she has realised that she is not in the least bit delicate or fragile and thoroughly enjoys playing rough and rolling around in the muck. Pam's mother has not seen this change in Pam yet. One of the story threads has Pam's mother talking with the headmistress in her study. Pam's mother is saying how delicate and fragile Pam is. The other story thread, which provides a dramatic and amusing contrast, has Pam playing in a rugby match for the school's junior team against another school. The pitch is a mudbath but none of the girls, least of all Pam, minds in the least. Pam is thoroughly enjoying herself. At one point, Pam dives headlong into a huge patch of sloppy mud to score a try. She is not just unbothered by this, she is delighted she gets to get even muddier at the same time as scoring for her team.","output":"# Chapter Ten: A Tale of Two Perspectives In the warm, neatly appointed study of the headmistress at Jasmine Towers, Mrs. Winters sat across from the headmistress herself, a look of concern etching her features. \\"I do hope Pamela is adjusting well here,\\" she began, folding her hands in her lap. \\"She's always been so delicate, you see. I worry that she might find some of the activities... um, a bit too rough for her liking.\\" --- On the rugby field, a stark contrast to the genteel conversation unfolding in the headmistress's study, Pam was anything but delicate. With her eyes fiercely set on the ball, she navigated through the mud with surprising agility, her teammates cheering her on. The pitch was a veritable swamp, but it only seemed to enhance Pam's determination. --- The headmistress, a woman of considerable experience with young girls' manifold hidden strengths, offered Mrs. Winters a reassuring smile. \\"Mrs. Winters, I understand your concerns. However, I believe Jasmine Towers provides an environment where girls can discover new strengths and perhaps redefine their own limits.\\" --- The rugby ball, slick with mud, spiraled through the air, and Pam's heart raced in anticipation. As the opposing team's defender closed in on her, Pam made a daring decision. With a burst of speed, she dove headlong into a particularly sloppy patch of mud, arms outstretched. Her fingers closed around the ball just as she slid across the try line, scoring for her team. The field erupted in cheers, and Pam emerged from the mud, beaming, more elated about the muck covering her from head to toe than the points she had just earned. --- Mrs. Winters sighed softly, casting a doubtful glance towards the headmistress. \\"I just can't imagine Pamela enjoying herself in such... boisterous activities. She's always been more inclined towards quieter, cleaner pursuits.\\" --- As Pam stood up, drenched in mud, her teammates rushed over, slapping her back and hugging her, regardless of the mess. Pam laughed heartily, the sound carrying across the field, infectious and full of pure joy. Any onlooker would find it impossible to reconcile this muddied, vibrant girl with the delicate flower her mother described. --- \\"Pamela has indeed found activities she enjoys,\\" the headmistress said thoughtfully, choosing her words carefully. \\"It's perhaps different from what you might expect, but it's been wonderful to see her embrace new challenges.\\" --- Huddling with her team as they planned their next move, Pam's eyes shone with confidence and excitement. The girl who once believed she was too fragile for anything rough or dirty had discovered a love for the game's thrills and the camaraderie found in the mire of the rugby field. --- Mrs. Winters nodded, but her expression remained tinged with apprehension. \\"If you think she's adjusting well... I suppose I must trust your judgment. It's just such a change from the Pamela I know.\\" --- As the game concluded, Pam's team emerged victorious, muddy but exuberant. As she walked off the field, splattered with mud from head to toe, Pam felt a surge of pride. Jasmine Towers had shown her a side of herself she never knew existed, and she couldn't wait to share this new passion with her mother, to see her surprise and, hopefully, her joy at this unexpected revelation. --- The headmistress stood and walked Mrs. Winters to the door. \\"Why don't we arrange for you to come and see some of the school activities?

As they approached the field, the sounds of shouts and cheers became clearer, a testament to the spirited game that was unfolding. --- By the time Mrs. Winters and the headmistress arrived at the sidelines, the match had just ended, but the field was still alive with the buzz of excitement. Players from both teams were congratulating each other, their uniforms indistinguishable under layers of mud, their faces adorned with grins of exhilaration and fatigue. --- As they neared, Pam spotted them from across the field. Her heart did a small leap - there was a part of her that had always wanted her mother to see this side of her, the side that had blossomed at Jasmine Towers. She jogged over, her boots making a squelching sound with each step, leaving muddy footprints in her wake. --- Mrs. Winters could hardly believe her eyes as Pam approached, almost unrecognizable under the mud, with a few small cuts and bruises visible on her arms and legs.

There was surprise, certainly, but also a burgeoning sense of pride and a realization that perhaps she hadn't known her daughter as well as she thought. --- The headmistress gently intervened, \\"It's been a journey of self-discovery for Pamela, as it is for many of our students. Jasmine Towers encourages each girl to explore and embrace their strengths, in all their forms.\\" --- Mrs. Winters looked back at Pam, seeing her not as the fragile child she had always sought to protect, but as the strong, capable young woman she was becoming. \\"I... I'm so proud of you, Pam. I'm sorry I didn't see it before. It seems you've found your place here.\\" --- Pam, moved by her mother's words, took a step forward, not minding the mud that she was undoubtedly transferring to her mother's clothes. They hugged, a perfect moment of understanding and acceptance between them. --- As they walked back to the school, Pam excitedly recounting the details of the match, Mrs. Winters listened with a heart full of love and admiration.

The muddier, the better!\\" She paused, searching for the right words to explain the exhilaration she felt. \\"When we play in the mud, it's not just about the rugby anymore.

Is the Disney branding still prominent in WorldWay, or have they completely reinvented the store’s look? **DisneyFanGlasgow**: @Collector123 They've definitely toned down the Disney-exclusive vibe. The store layout is quite different, more inclusive of all the franchises. Disney is still there, but it's like they're part of a bigger family now. **PokeMaster23**: This might sound silly, but does the store feel magical?

The Disney signage has been replaced with \\"Kangurola\\" in bright pink text, along with a new logo featuring two kangaroo silhouettes, one pink and the other purple. 🦘 Wasn't expecting that! **DisneyDetective**: Wow, that’s quite a transformation! 😮 Has anyone seen what kind of merchandise they're selling yet? And what's up with the kangaroo theme? Does it have anything to do with Disney, or is it a whole new entity? **KangarooLover**: This is exciting! The kangaroo theme is certainly unique. I passed by this morning, and although I couldn’t get a good look inside, the images of Pluto, Minnie, and Winnie the Pooh on the windows suggest they're still Disney-oriented, at least partially. Maybe it's a new concept store? **NostalgiaHunter**: I'm a bit sad to see the original Disney store go, though. There was something special about it. 😔 Remember the \\"Goodbye\\" message with the Mickey silhouette? That felt like the end of an era. I’m glad they took down that vague and depressing farewell, at least. Gives hope that they're moving to something more upbeat. **BrandWatcher**: It’s intriguing to see Disney experiment like this. If Kangurola is indeed connected to Disney, and not just retaining some Disney merch, it could signify a new direction in how they approach physical retail spaces. I’m particularly curious about the choice of kangaroo imagery – it stands out, but what's the connection? **EuroTripEnthusiast**: I was in Fuengirola last year and visited the Disney store several times. Can't believe it's gone through such a drastic change. Does anyone know if this Kangurola is a one-off thing, or are there plans to expand this concept elsewhere? **MerchMadness**: Just had a quick look at Kangurola this afternoon. They have a wide range of items that aren't just Disney – saw some Pokémon and Marvel stuff, too. Looks like they're diversifying. Still, the store retains a kid-friendly vibe with a hint of nostalgia for the adults. I like the direction they’re taking. **KangarooLover**: That sounds amazing, @MerchMadness! I was worried it would stray too far from its roots, but it seems like Kangurola is trying to balance the old with the new. Still, does anyone have any idea why they went with kangaroos? It's cute, but I'm scratching my head over here. 🤔 **GraphicDesignGuru**: About the kangaroos, it's a pretty clever branding move if you ask me. Kangaroos are unique, dynamic, and family-focused animals. For a store that’s rebranding and looking to appeal to both kids and their parents, what better than a logo that embodies energy and care? Plus, the colors pink and purple suggest fun and creativity. **TravelVlogger101**: This is such a fascinating development! I wasn't planning on visiting Fuengirola again so soon, but this makes me want to book a trip just to check out Kangurola. It sounds like a mix of old and new that could pull in both Disney loyalists and new customers. **FuengirolaFan**: Great insights, everyone! I think this transformation could be something positive. Maybe it's about time to give Kangurola a chance and see how it evolves. I'm planning to visit next weekend and will report back with more details and hopefully, some photos! **DisneyDetective**: Looking forward to your update, @FuengirolaFan. This whole situation is a fascinating case study in brand evolution. Disney or not, Kangurola is making waves, and that’s interesting in its own right. --- **The conversation continues as forum members speculate about the future of Kangurola, share their memories of the Disney store, and express their enthusiasm or concerns about the new direction. Over time, the thread becomes a valuable resource for updates and firsthand experiences of Kangurola’s development and its impact on the Fuengirola retail scene.**"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up a few years later when a Disney store in Paris closes, with that depressing goodbye, A user says \\"Anyone feel another WorldWay or Kangurola coming on\\"","output":"**Thread Title: \\"Disney Store Closure in Paris: Speculations and Predictions\\"** **ParisDisneyFan**: Sad news for all Disney fans in Paris 😔. I walked past our beloved Disney store on Boulevard Haussmann today, only to see it closed with that now all-too-familiar, somewhat depressing goodbye message. No detailed explanation, just a silhouette of Mickey waving. This feels like the end of an era, but given past patterns, can we expect a transformation akin to WorldWay or Kangurola? **EuroMouse**: Ah, not again! I remember being gutted when the Fuengirola store closed, and then pleasantly surprised by its rebranding. Anyone else feel another WorldWay or Kangurola coming on? It's like Disney's leaving breadcrumbs for us to follow. **RetroCollector**: @EuroMouse, That was my first thought too! I’ve been following these transformations since the Glasgow event. If they do launch a new concept, I wonder what theme they’ll embrace this time? Animals seem to be a recurrent theme, maybe something along those lines? **FutureBrandSpotter**: Intriguing! Every time Disney pulls this move, there's a period of speculation followed by something innovative. Paris being a fashion capital, perhaps we'll see something that combines Disney with high fashion or art? Imagine \\"Artistique\\"... with Disney and other pop culture merged into unique art pieces or fashion statements. **DisneyNostalgiaLover**: While I am all for innovation and finding new ways to engage fans, part of me mourns the loss of the traditional Disney store experience. Those stores held so much magic and childhood memories. I just hope whatever comes next can capture a fraction of that spirit. **PopCultureAnalyst**: There seems to be a trend here. Close with the Mickey silhouette as a signal for innovation rather than an end, then re-open with a brand that broadens the appeal beyond just Disney die-hards. Given the Parisian love for comics (think: Bande Dessinée), could we be looking at Disney entering the broader pop culture comics space? **TheParisienne**: As a local, I'm both saddened and excited. Sad because the Disney Store was a landmark for many of us here, yet excited for what's next. Paris has a rich history of embracing and transforming art and culture. This could be a fantastic opportunity to set a new standard. **MickeyWatcher**: Let’s not forget the importance of location. Paris is iconic, and whatever replaces the Disney Store will need to resonate not just with locals, but also with the international crowd that flocks to Paris. This isn’t just about filling a retail space; it’s about crafting a new story. **ThemeParkDreamer**: Does anyone else think there might be a connection to the attractions at Disneyland Paris? Like a cross-promotional space that brings part of the park into the city, blending Disney with other brands or themes in a way that’s never been done before? **EuroMouse**: Great points, everyone! I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this location. Maybe it's time for a fan meetup in Paris to bid the old store one last farewell and speculate in person about the future. Who’s in? --- **The thread continues as members from around the world share their thoughts, theories, and memories, turning the closure of the Paris Disney Store into a global conversation filled with anticipation and reflection on the magic of Disney and its ability to evolve and surprise its fans.**"},{"instruction":"Write a news article about the 2 prime examples of this, and the notice that implies it, Read the notice","output":"**Disney Store Closures Spark Transformation and Speculation Among Fans** In an intriguing turn of events, Disney store closures in major cities have led to a fascinating pattern of transformation and speculation among the brand's enthusiasts worldwide. Notably, the stores in Glasgow and Fuengirola have caught the attention of Disney fans and retail watchers alike for their unique metamorphosis, leading to broad speculation about the future of Disney's retail footprint. In Glasgow, the beloved Disney store at St Enoch Centre closed its doors, leaving behind a melancholic message featuring a silhouette of Mickey Mouse alongside a vague and somewhat foreboding \\"Goodbye.\\" This ambiguous farewell, however, was not the end. Mere months later, the store space reemerged as \\"WorldWay,\\" a vibrant retail destination that continued to offer Disney merchandise alongside an expanded range of products from franchises like Kikoriki, Pokémon, and Doctor Who. Similarly, in Fuengirola, the local Disney store underwent a notable transformation. After closing with the same enigmatic goodbye message, the store was reborn as \\"Kangurola,\\" sporting a lively kangaroo-themed branding and expanding its merchandise line to include Disney favorites alongside other popular characters and series. The recurring motif in these closures is the goodbye message itself. Instead of a clear-cut farewell, the inclusion of a Mickey silhouette seems to imply a future of possibilities rather than a definitive end. While a \\"Thank you for being our guest\\" notice has been observed at locations genuinely closing for good, the silhouette message has sparked a wave of anticipation and speculation among fans about what's to come. Industry analysts suggest that this strategy may be Disney's way of testing new retail concepts and partnerships, allowing the company to remain flexible and responsive in a rapidly changing retail landscape. The mix of nostalgia and novelty in stores like WorldWay and Kangurola caters to a wide audience, ensuring that Disney's magic continues to reach consumers in innovative ways. Fans worldwide are now keeping a close eye on any Disney store displaying the now-iconic silhouette farewell, wondering which city will next experience Disney's transformative touch. The anticipation builds not only for the unveiling of new retail concepts but also for the potential revival of cherished Disney memories in a contemporary format. What's evident is that in the world of Disney retail, a \\"Goodbye\\" is not always the end but rather the beginning of a new adventure. Disney's ability to reinvent its retail spaces, while maintaining a connection to its core brand and beloved characters, underscores the company's enduring appeal and its commitment to bringing joy and magic to fans across the globe."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet in Spain in early November 2022 about the message, read the full message out, and then state the signage is changing, and this notice will be pulled away, and reveal the new name","output":"Given the evolving nature of information, I'll create a hypothetical tweet as if it were posted in early November 2022 regarding the transformation of a Disney store in Spain, following the context of previous inquiries and the pattern observed with store transformations: --- 🌟🇪🇸**@TiendaMagicaES** 🌟🇪🇸 🚨¡Noticia emocionante para todos los fans de Disney en España!

Kikoriki, Pokémon, and Doctor Who seem to be the golden trio of the rebranding efforts. Thoughts on why these three? **PokeFanatic423**: Absolutely noticed it! Pokémon being a part of the mix makes total sense due to its massive, diverse fan base and endless merchandising potential. It appeals to nearly every age group, ensuring wide appeal. **WhoVianMaster**: Doctor Who's inclusion also seems logical to me. It has a long history and a deeply loyal fanbase. Plus, its themes of time travel and regeneration sort of metaphorically match the store's transformation process, don't you think? **KikorikiCritic**: As for Kikoriki, it's a bit more niche but has a loyal following in certain regions. Perhaps it's a strategic move to introduce more variety and attract fans looking for something different from the usual mainstream offerings? **MerchMaven**: Certainly, it seems like each franchise brings something unique to the table: Pokémon for broad appeal, Doctor Who for the in-depth fandom, and Kikoriki for niche appeal. This trio provides a solid base that appeals to a wide range of customers, both young and old. **StoreTransformFan**: I think it's also about striking a balance between new and old. While Pokémon and Doctor Who have been around for decades, Kikoriki represents the newer wave of characters and stories. It ensures that the stores keep evolving with changing audience tastes. **RetroCollector**: Has anyone thought about the merch crossover potential? Imagine Pokémon and Doctor Who crossover collectibles. That would be epic! It's a smart move to mix and match franchises with dedicated fanbases—it creates buzz and draws in crowds looking for unique items. **NostalgiaNerd**: It’s interesting to see how these franchises can help define the identity of a rebranded store. They're not just selling products; they're creating a new culture within the store that appeals to nostalgia while still looking forward. **GlobalGamer**: And let's not overlook the international appeal. Pokémon and Doctor Who have fans worldwide, while Kikoriki's inclusion might tap into markets outside the usual spheres, giving the store an even broader audience. **FanTheoryFiesta**: Here's a theory - maybe the choice of these franchises is a subtle message about the nature of change itself. Pokémon evolves, Doctor Who regenerates, and Kikoriki... well, I'm still working on that part, but it’s about new adventures, right? It's like each store's transformation mirrors these themes of growth and exploration. **GalacticGeek**: Fantastic insights, everyone! It really illustrates the depth of strategy behind franchise selection following a store's “regeneration.” These aren’t just random picks; there's a narrative and market appeal being carefully crafted here.

La clave está en identificar nichos de mercado con alta demanda y poca competencia, o bien, en aprovechar las habilidades personales de cada uno para generar ingresos. A continuación, te presento cinco de los mejores negocios online más rentables con menor inversión: 1. **Marketing de Afiliados**: Este modelo de negocio consiste en la promoción de productos o servicios de terceros a cambio de una comisión por cada venta o acción realizada a través de tu enlace de afiliado. Las inversiones en marketing de afiliados pueden ser bastante bajas, ya que el enfoque principal radica en las estrategias de marketing digital para atraer tráfico a esos productos. Plataformas como Amazon Associates, ClickBank, o ShareASale ofrecen amplias oportunidades. 2. **Creación y venta de Cursos Online**: Si tienes habilidades o conocimientos especializados, puedes crear y vender cursos online. Plataformas como Udemy, Teachable, y Skillshare te permiten publicar tus cursos a una amplia audiencia sin necesidad de contar con un sitio web. La inversión aquí se enfoca más que nada en el tiempo y los recursos para crear el contenido de alta calidad. 3. **Dropshipping**: Este modelo de negocio te permite tener una tienda online sin necesidad de manejar inventario. Básicamente, te asocias con un proveedor que se encarga de almacenar, empacar y enviar los productos directamente a tus clientes. Tus ganancias vienen de la diferencia entre el precio de venta y el precio de compra al por mayor. Shopify y Oberlo son dos herramientas populares que facilitan empezar un negocio de dropshipping. 4. **Freelancing**: Si tienes una habilidad particular, como escribir, diseñar, programar, traducir, entre otras, puedes ofrecer tus servicios en plataformas de freelancing como Upwork, Freelancer, o Fiverr. La inversión es mínima, principalmente tu tiempo y, quizás, la suscripción a alguna de estas plataformas o herramientas que mejoren tu oferta de servicios. 5. **Venta de Productos Digitales**: Se trata de crear productos digitales como ebooks, plantillas, fotografías, música, o cualquier otro producto digital que la gente esté dispuesta a comprar. Una vez creados, puedes venderlos una y otra vez sin costos adicionales de producción o envío. Sitios como Etsy o incluso tu propia página web pueden servir como plataformas de venta. Estos negocios online destacan por su baja inversión inicial y la posibilidad de gestionarlos desde cualquier parte del mundo, ofreciendo flexibilidad y una potencial alta rentabilidad. Sin embargo, el éxito dependerá de la dedicación, la constancia, y las estrategias de marketing que se implementen para atraer y retener clientes."},{"instruction":"\\"This girl, Nano Yamaneko, eleven years old... is not my little sister or anything.

At this school the girls all play rugby regularly instead of more traditional girls' sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House.","output":"Chapter Seven: The Mud-Bathed Match On a crisp Saturday morning, the vast playing fields of Jasmine Towers stood under a blanket of anticipation. The usual tranquility was broken by the muffled sounds of eager chatter and the soft thudding of rugby boots pacing the ground. Today was no ordinary day; it was the day of the grand match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House, a tradition that had the entire school buzzing with excitement. The sky, a tapestry of soft greys, promised a downpour, but that only added to the thrill. For the girls at Jasmine Towers, rugby wasn't merely a sport; it was an adventure, an unabashed embrace of the mud and the grit. And today, they looked forward to the match not just for the glory of victory but for the sheer joy of getting thoroughly muddied in the process. As the referee's whistle pierced the nippy air, signaling the start of the game, the girls took their positions with determined expressions. Daisy House, wearing their green and white stripes, faced their opponents, Rose House, clad in vibrant red and black hoops. From the sidelines, cheers erupted, a blend of house chants and encouragement that filled the players with a sense of pride and belonging. The game commenced with an intensity that matched the gathering clouds overhead. The rugby ball, slick with morning dew, was a comet of white that flew from hand to hand, uniting the team members in a dance of strategy and skill. When the first droplets of rain began to fall, soft at first, then growing heavier, the field transformed into a slippery arena, much to the delight of the younger girls. \\"They say it's the mud that makes a true Jasmine Towers rugby player,\\" whispered Ellie, a spirited first-year from Daisy House, to her friend Mia as they prepared for the next scrum. Mia, her face already streaked with mud, grinned in agreement. Indeed, the mud became the unspoken star of the match. With each tackle and scrum, the players became more emboldened, diving into the muck without a second thought. Laughter rang out amidst the grunts of effort, as players from both teams found themselves sliding, falling, and sometimes, intentionally rolling in the mud. Yet, amid the mud-soaked chaos, the skills and teamwork of the older girls shone brightly, their experience guiding their younger teammates through the mire, literally and figuratively. As the game neared its conclusion, with both teams neck and neck, a sense of camaraderie transcended house rivalries. Mud-caked faces wore smiles of genuine joy and respect for the game and for each other. In the final moments, a daring run by Rose House's youngest wing, Lottie, broke the deadlock, earning her team a hard-fought victory. Yet, as both teams congregated at the center of the field, there was no sense of defeat, only shared triumph. The aftermath of the match was a sight to behold. Exhausted but exhilarated, the girls made their way back to the changing rooms, leaving a trail of muddy footprints in their wake. Stories of spectacular falls and heroic tackles were exchanged, growing in legend with each retelling. The showers ran long that afternoon, the water turning brown as it swirled down the drains, but not before the girls had a chance to compare who was the muddiest of them all. Later, as they gathered in the dining hall, clean and refreshed, the girls of Jasmine Towers were united in a bond stronger than any house rivalry. They had faced the mud together, emerging not just as players, but as warriors of the field, forever proud to wear its badge. And so, the tale of the mud-bathed match between Rose House and Daisy House was etched into the annals of Jasmine Towers, a story to inspire and delight for generations to come. For in the heart of every Jasmine Towers girl beat the love of the game, the team, and yes, the glorious, glorious mud."},{"instruction":"Please write another chapter, which contains an essay by one of the junior girls titled \\"I love getting muddy!\\"","output":"Chapter Twelve: An Ode to Mud The sun shone brightly through the windows of the Jasmine Towers common room, where the junior girls of Lavender House were gathered for their weekly essay club. Today, they were sharing essays based on the prompt \\"Write about something you love,\\" a theme that had inspired an array of passionate compositions, from adorations of family pets to tributes to chocolate cake. However, it was Molly's turn that stirred an air of anticipation. Known for her spirited disposition and love for rugby, her chosen subject had piqued everyone's curiosity. Clearing her throat, Molly stood up, her essay clutched tightly in her mud-stained hands—a testament to her chosen topic. \\"I love getting muddy!\\" she declared with a beaming smile, causing a wave of chuckles to ripple through the room. But as she began to read, the room fell into an attentive silence, each girl drawn into Molly's muddy world. \\"Most people think of mud as something to avoid, a nuisance that soils your clothes and shoes. But to me, mud is a symbol of joy, a testament to adventures had and memories made. There is an inexplicable thrill in feeling the earth beneath your feet transform into a slippery playground, where each step is a dance with gravity. At Jasmine Towers, we are lucky to have rugby, a sport that celebrates not just skill and teamwork but also the sheer delight of getting muddy. The first time I dove into a muddy puddle during a game, I was hooked. The sensation of mud oozing through my fingers, splattering against my skin, was liberating. It was as if, in that moment, I was part of the earth, laughing in the face of decorum. Getting muddy is a transformative experience. It strips away worries about appearances and liberates you from societal expectations to remain pristine. There's a unity in mud; it doesn't discriminate, covering everyone equally in its gooey embrace. After a rugby match, as we stand together, caked in mud from head to toe, there's a sense of camaraderie that transcends the game itself. We are warriors of the same muddy battleground, sharing in the triumphs and spills of life. Beyond the field, mud has taught me to embrace imperfections. Life is messy, and like mud, it gets everywhere, often when you least expect it. But there's beauty in that messiness, in learning to navigate the slippery paths and revel in the unpredictable. Mud has made me resilient, teaching me that it's okay to fall, as long as you get back up, even if it means leaving a few mud stains behind. So, you see, getting muddy isn't just about playing a sport or getting dirty. It's a celebration of life's messy adventures, a reminder to laugh, play, and love with all your heart, without fear of getting a little mud on your shoes (or, in our case, everywhere else). I love getting muddy because it reminds me to live fully, embracing every slip, slide, and splash along the way.\\" As Molly finished reading, the room erupted into applause, her words having resonated with a newfound appreciation for the joy of getting muddy. Discussions sprang up around her, tales of muddy mishaps and adventures shared with laughter and nods of agreement. It was clear that Molly's ode to mud had not only captured the essence of their beloved rugby tradition but had also touched upon a deeper truth about embracing life's messy, beautiful journey. And in that moment, the girls of Jasmine Towers felt an even deeper connection to the mud-speckled fields they called their playground, grateful for the muddy, messy memories they were creating together."},{"instruction":"Please write a chapter where the English teacher asks the junior girls to write a lighthearted essay about \\"Why rugby is the best sport, because you get muddy\\".

She had noticed how much her students enjoyed discussing their rugby experiences, especially the muddy aspects. Thus, she decided to take a lighter approach for this week's essay assignment. \\"Ladies,\\" she commenced, addressing the eager faces of the junior girls, \\"this week, I want you to write a lighthearted essay on 'Why rugby is the best sport because you get muddy.' Remember, I'm looking for smiles and laughter in your writing, not just arguments.\\" The classroom buzzed with excitement at the thought of putting their muddy escapades into words. It was a refreshing prompt, focusing solely on the delightful aspect of getting covered in mud, without the need to touch upon the concepts of teamwork or challenging stereotypes they had explored previously. Among the essays submitted, Lucy's stood out for its heartfelt and amusing exposition on the joy of mud in rugby. Mrs. Walker, impressed with Lucy's work, shared it with the class, recognizing it as an exemplary piece that captured the assignment's essence. --- **Why Rugby Is the Best Sport, Because You Get Muddy** *By Lucy* \\"Rugby must have been designed with a secret motive in mind: to grant girls the ultimate freedom to get as dirty as possible without a single reprimand. Indeed, it feels like rugby was ingeniously crafted to ensure we not only get dirty but revel in the joy of mud. From the moment you step onto the field, the game calls to you, a siren song promising adventures in the great seas of mud. With every tackle, every scrum, and every daring dive for the try line, rugby provides an all-access pass to a world where getting dirty isn't just allowed; it's the main attraction. Consider the scrum – that glorious gathering of strength and strategy where pushing and shoving in the mud is the order of the day. Or the artful dodge and dive, where your only hope of evading your opponent often ends with a spectacular slide through the mud. Rugby pitches are no less than canvases, and we, the players, become artists, painting our path with every fall and roll, our uniforms the evidence of a game well-played. In no other sport is the act of getting muddy so celebrated. Imagine trying to remain pristine and clean on the rugby field; you'd not only miss out on the fun but likely earn a stern look from your coach for not giving it your all. It's as if the game explicitly instructs us to abandon our inhibitions and throw ourselves – quite literally – into the experience. The joy of mud in rugby transcends the mere act of getting dirty. It symbolizes a breaking of chains, a departure from the expected, allowing us to challenge the idea that girls must always remain clean and composed. On the rugby field, our valor is measured in mud splatters, our bravery in the willingness to dive headfirst into a puddle. Beyond the echoes of cheers and the thrill of the game, it’s the moments of muddy glory that stay with us. The laughter shared over a particularly spectacular fall, the camaraderie in helping a teammate to her feet, only to slip and both end up even muddier – these are the memories that rugby gifts us. In conclusion, rugby is the best sport because it offers us a freedom unmatched by any other: the freedom to get muddy, to embrace the mess and find joy in the chaos. There's a peculiar satisfaction in finishing a game covered head to toe in mud, a tangible proof of your effort, teamwork, and the sheer fun of playing. After all, if getting dirty is the measure of a day well spent, then rugby is the sport that ensures our days are nothing short of magnificent.\\" --- Mrs. Walker smiled warmly as the class erupted in applause for Lucy's essay. There were nods of agreement and shared laughter, each girl reflecting on her own muddy memories with fondness. Through Lucy's words, they were reminded of the unique liberation and joy found in the muddy embrace of rugby, an experience that bonded them in delightful ways beyond the rugby field."},{"instruction":"Please write a chapter about some new first form girls having their first ever rugby lesson.

Although some of the girls are a bit hesitant about playing this strange, rough sport, by the end of the lesson, the overwhelming opinion expressed is quite simply \\"I love getting muddy!\\"","output":"Chapter Four: First Tackles and First Laughs The crisp morning sun cast long shadows across the rugby fields of Jasmine Towers as the new first form girls made their way onto the pitch for their very first rugby lesson. Among them, a mixture of excitement and apprehension fluttered like a flock of butterflies. For many, the notion of playing rugby, a sport they had only seen boys play back home, felt foreign and somewhat intimidating. Miss Green, the physical education teacher and rugby coach, stood tall and imposing, yet her eyes sparkled with an infectious enthusiasm. \\"Welcome, girls, to your first rugby lesson!\\" she announced with a voice that carried across the field. \\"Today, we'll be learning the basics, but most importantly, we'll have fun and perhaps get a bit muddy.\\" A few girls exchanged nervous glances at the mention of getting muddy, their experiences with sports so far having emphasized staying as pristine as possible. Yet, the open, expectant faces around them hinted at a shared curiosity and readiness for whatever lay ahead. The lesson began with a simple explanation of the rules, which seemed almost alien to ears accustomed to netball and hockey. \\"Rugby,\\" Miss Green explained, \\"is not just about strength. It's about courage, quick thinking, and, above all, teamwork.\\" She demonstrated how to hold and pass the oval ball, its odd shape causing a few fumbles and giggles among the girls as they tried to mimic her. As the morning dew began to lift, replaced by the warmer touch of the sun, Miss Green introduced them to tackling. The very word sent a ripple of apprehension through the ranks, but Miss Green was quick to dispel their fears, showing them the proper, safe way to tackle and be tackled. \\"Remember, the ground's here to catch you,\\" she said with a wink. What followed was an exercise in trust and bravery. The girls, hesitantly at first, attempted their inaugural tackles on padded mats. There were slips, trips, and more than a few accidental tumbles, each met with bursts of laughter from both the participants and their onlookers. It was during these tentative first attempts at tackling that the magic of mud made its grand entrance. A gentle drizzle, seemingly summoned out of nowhere, began to soften the field, transforming it into a slick playground. Miss Green seized the moment, encouraging the girls to embrace the conditions. \\"Rugby isn't the same without a bit of mud,\\" she proclaimed, demonstrating how to dive for the ball into a particularly muddy patch. Emboldened by their teacher's example and the infectious joy of getting a little dirty, the girls began to dive, slide, and tumble with growing enthusiasm. The mud, once a source of apprehension, became a badge of honor, a shared symbol of their newfound bravery and camaraderie. By the end of the lesson, the initial hesitance had transformed into exhilaration. Faces streaked with mud and smiles beamed as the girls recounted their daring tackles and unexpected slides. In the changing rooms, the prevailing sentiment was unanimous and vocal: \\"I love getting muddy!\\" As they washed off the evidence of their morning adventure, stories of personal triumphs and hilarious mishaps filled the air. The experience of playing rugby—of engaging in a sport where getting dirty was not just allowed but celebrated—had opened a new door for the first form girls. That day, a new tradition was born among the newest members of Jasmine Towers. They walked away with more than just muddy uniforms; they carried with them the realization that courage could be found in the willingness to fall and that joy could spring from the most unexpected places—even from the mud beneath their feet."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[스타일 따지다가 망하는 건 너지.] 드디어 전태국과 전민국의 역사적인 계약이 성사됐다. 전태국과 전민국 둘 다 뿌듯한 얼굴로 계약서를 내려다봤다. “이제 된 거지?” “네, 형!” 민국이는 얼른 태세를 전환을 했다. 심지어 방글방글 웃기까지 했다. 전태국은 민국이 말 한마디에 올라가는 입꼬리를 애써 내리고 있었다. “이제 앞으로 쭉 형이라고 불러.” “당연하죠, 형!” 전태국이 나를 잠시 쳐다봤다. “주말인데, 뭐 일 시키고 그러는 건 아니지?” “주말은 쉬어야죠. 전 무엇보다 워라밸을 중요하게 여기거든요.” “워라밸? 그게 뭐야?” 2004년에 워라밸은 아직 한국에서는 낯선 개념이었다. 하지만 미국에서는 몇 년 전부터 소개되기 시작한 개념이었다. “일과 삶의 균형을 맞춘 삶을 살아야죠. 그래야 행복하게 오래 살죠.” 이때, 민국이의 따가운 눈초리가 느껴졌지만 나는 애써 모른 척했다. 전태국은 고개를 끄덕였다. “멋진 말이네. 앞으로 회사 경영할 때 참고해야겠어, 워라밸. 그럼, 주말이니까 난 쉴게.” “그러세요. 태국이 형, 그래도 인턴 마지막 주에 회장님이랑 임원분들 앞에 두고 프레젠테이션 해야 하는 것은 틈틈이 준비하세요.” “걱정 마, 나 전태국이야.” 전태국은 손을 흔들더니 문을 열고 나갔다. 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 이때, 민국이가 내 손을 슬쩍 잡아끌었다. “형아, 태국이 형한테는 워라밸인지 뭔지 지키라고 하고는 형은 왜 하나도 안 지켜?” “민국아, 태국이 형은 삼전 그룹 회장의 아들이잖아. 태어날 때부터 일하지 않아도 상상할 수 없는 부를 가지고 태어난 사람이야. 하지만 나와 넌 아니지?” “응….” 민국이는 고개를 끄덕였다. “우리 같이 가난하게 태어난 사람들은 몇 배로 노력해야 성공할 수 있는 거야.” “형아….” “응?” “형아는 돈을 많이 버는 게 꿈이야?” “그거야….” [당연한 건데, 그걸 왜 묻는 거지?] 나는 의아한 눈으로 민국이를 내려다봤다. “형아, 난 HAT 같은 아이돌이 되고 싶은 게 꿈이잖아. 무대에서 노래하고 춤추고, 랩도 하고. 근데 형은 이제 겨우 14살인데. 뭐, 외모는 철수 형이나 태국이 형이나 비슷한 나이 같지만. 암튼….” 민국이는 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. [왜 그렇게 측은하게 보는 거야?] “형아, 나는 비행기 타면 비행기 기장이 되고 싶기도 하고. 변호사 아저씨 만나면 변호사가 돼 보고도 싶거든. 근데, 형은 돈을 많이 버는 게 꿈인 게 이상하잖아. 돈은 내가 일한 결과이지, 목적이 될 수는 없는 거 아니야?” “…….” 나는 할 말을 잃었다. 돈은 일의 결과이지, 목적은 될 수 없다고? 나는 속으로 잠시 쓴웃음을 지었다. [아이큐 160은 뭐가 달라도 다른 건가. 하아- 나 같이 겨우 아이큐 120은 역시 생각이 부족해.] 민국이가 내 손을 꼭 잡았다. “형아, 난 형아가 가끔은 친구 형아들처럼 철없고 떼쓰고 그런 형아였으면 해.” “흠….” 나는 민국이를 빤히 쳐다봤다. 나는 내 동생 전민국을 너무 잘 알았다. 이렇게 어른스러운 척, 남의 마음을 꿰뚫는 척 이야기할 때는 분명 목적이 있었다. “전민국, 원하는 게 뭐야?” “히잇, 형아, 어떻게 알았어?” [형이 머리는 너보다 나쁘지만, 삶의 연륜이라는 게 있어.] “어서 말해봐.” “형아, 나 어학연수 끝나고 한국 가기 전에 디즈니랜드 같이 가고 싶어. 친구들한테 미국 가서 디즈니랜드 갈 거라고 엄청 자랑했단 말이야.” “전민국, 어학원에서 마지막 주에 시험 보지?” “형아가 그걸 어떻게 알았어?” 민국이의 눈동자가 심하게 흔들렸다. “형이 다 전화해서 알아봤지.” “형아, 설마…?” 민국이는 점점 더 초조해졌다. “어학원 마지막 시험에서 90점 넘으면 디즈니랜드에 데리고 갈게.” “형아, 너무해!” “싫으면 디즈니랜드는 아주 못 가는 거야. 이 제안을 받아들일 거야, 말 거야?” “형아, 나빠!” “싫으면 말고.” 민국이는 입을 꼭 다물고 있더니 화난 눈으로 나를 쏘아봤다. “알았어! 알았다고! 90점 넘으면 되잖아!” “민국아, 넌 머리가 좋으니까 조금만 노력하면 90점 쉽게 넘을 수 있을 거야.” “형아, 병 주고 약 주지 마.” 민국이는 축 처진 어깨로 방으로 들어가며 슬쩍 뒤돌아 나를 원망 어린 눈으로 노려봤다. 나는 그런 민국이의 모습을 보며 빙긋이 웃었다. [전민국, 세상에 공짜는 없어! 동생도 예외는 아니야. 돈이 인생의 목적은 될 수 없지만, 돈이 없으면 꿈꿀 기회도 사라진다는 것을 명심하라고!] * * * 너튜브 사무실은 아플 캠퍼스에서 멀지 않은 곳이었다. 나지막한 건물의 2층에 위치해서 창밖으로 나무가 손에 잡힐 듯 가까웠다. 사무실은 ‘페이스 노트’와 크기는 엇비슷했지만, 직원은 좀 더 많았다. 주말인데도 모두 분주히 작업을 하고 있었다. “채드, 주말인데도 모두 나왔네요?” “어… 내년에 오픈하는 게 목표라서 요즘 정신이 없어. 베타 서비스 곧 시작할 거거든요. 참, 이 꼬마가 네 동생이야?” “네.” 채드 천은 민국이에게 다정하게 인사를 했다. “민국아, 반가워. 여기 구경하고 싶다고 했다며?” “네, 형이 이 플랫폼에 자기가 직접 찍은 동영상 올릴 수 있다고 해서요.” “와우, 민국이가 이런 데 관심이 많구나.” “제가 꿈이 가수거든요. 노래만 하는 가수가 아니라 춤도 추고 하는 그런 가수요.” “엔싱크 같은?” “네에!” 민국이는 크게 대답했다. 그 바람에 너튜브 사무실에 있는 직원들이 기분 좋게 웃었다. 채드 천이 잠시 고민하더니 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 곧 있을 베타 서비스에 동생이 노래하거나 춤추는 동영상 한번 올려보는 거 어때?” [내가 바란 것도 바로 그거야, 채드.] 민국이가 하고 싶다는 얼굴로 내 손을 꼭 쥐었다. “형아….” “채드, 디지털카메라로 찍어서 올리면 되는 거죠?” “응. 편한 방식으로 올려봐. 영상 편집 프로그램 써서 올리면 좋지만, 아직 초창기니까 굳이 안 그래도 될 것 같아. 안 그래도 다양한 분야에서 동영상 올릴 사람을 모집 중이었거든. 민국이가 해주면 난 너무 좋을 것 같아. 우리 채널은 어쨌든 다양성이 생명이거든.” 나는 민국이를 내려다봤다. “민국아, 한번 해볼래?” “네에! 형아!” 민국이는 손을 번쩍 들었다. * * * “형아, 제대로 찍어야 해. 알았지?” “응, 알았어.” 나는 아빠가 미국 올 때 사진 많이 찍으라며 준 디지털카메라로 민국이의 동영상 촬영을 시작했다. 숙소 거실에서 민국이는 대한민국의 유행곡을 틀어놓고 최선을 다해서 춤을 추기 시작했다. 쿵쿵쿵. 일요일 아침부터 요란한 비트가 숙소 안을 가득 채웠다. 마크가 뒤에서 말을 걸었다. “성국, 지금 뭐 하는 거야?” “어, 미안. 시끄럽지?” “어차피 일하려고 일어나던 참이었어.” 순간, 마크는 춤추는 민국이를 보고는 넋을 놓고 빠져들었다. 곧이어 리미미도 옆자리에 앉아서 커피를 마시며 민국이를 넋 놓고 보고 있었다. 민국이의 춤이 끝나자 모두 박수를 쳤다. “민국아! 대단해!” 마크의 환호에 민국이가 어깨를 으쓱했다. [역시 피는 물보다 진한 것인가. 버릇까지 닮다니….] “사장님, 제가 동영상 찍은 거 한번 봐도 될까요? 제가 한국 드라마와 한국 가수 덕질 좀 했잖아요.” “리미미 씨가 보고 어떤지 냉정하게 판단해 주세요.” 리미미는 심각한 얼굴로 동영상을 쭉 돌려봤다. 솔직히 JP에서 연습생 생활을 한 달이나 한 우수 연습생이었던 나의 견해로 민국이의 춤에는 근본이 없었다. TV 가수들을 무작정 따라 한 춤이다 보니 기본기가 절대적으로 부족했다. “리미미 씨, 어때요?” “흠… 우선 기본기가 좀 약해 보이긴 하는데요. 그것보다 더 큰 문제가 있어요.” “뭔데요?” “동영상 화질이 너무 구려요, 사장님!” 이건 예상치 못한 답이었다. “성국, 동생을 위해서 카메라 하나 사는 게 어때? 민국이 꿈이 가수면 앞으로 이런저런 오디션 나가려면 동영상 많이 찍어야 할 텐데….” “흠….” 돈이 아깝다는 게 아니라, 카메라 화질이 오디션의 당락을 좌우하는 큰 문제는 아닐 거란 판단에서 고심이 됐다. 이때, 초인종이 울렸다. 젊은 양 비서와 전태국의 모습이 보였다. 나는 얼른 문을 열었다. 그리고 어느 때보다 전태국을 반겼다. “어서 오세요! 아침부터 무슨 일이세요?” “음악 소리가 들려서 아침부터 무슨 파티 하나 구경 왔지.” 전태국이 태연하게 이야기했다. 민국이도 뒤에서 전태국을 반겼다. “형! 나, 춤추는 거 동영상 찍고 있어요.” “동영상 찍은 거 나도 봐도 돼?” “물론이죠.” 나는 얼른 전태국에게 카메라를 넘겼다. 전태국은 심각한 표정으로 동영상을 보더니 머리를 긁적였다. “이거 화질이 너무 구리잖아. 이번에 삼전에서 새로 나온 카메라 내가 가지고 왔는데, 그걸로 다시 찍는 게 어때?” [전태국, 역시 너는 글로벌 호구였어!] 나와 민국이는 손을 번쩍 들고 외쳤다. “좋아요!”","output":"Episode 151 Jeon Taeguk looked down at Jeon Minkuk with a bewildered face. \\"Our company's lawyer said this contract is too unfair. Since I'm an intern at 'Face Note', could you talk to your brother and try to adjust the contract terms?\\" \\"Uncle, don't you know our brother is irreplaceable?\\" \\"This is too much. Why is the compensation amount so high? This is outright tyranny.\\" \\"Uncle, you're the heir to Samjeon Group and you're being swayed by lawyers?\\" \\"What? That's...\\" Minkuk's words somehow seemed to make sense. Taeguk was lost in thought for a moment. Minkuk did not miss this opportunity. \\"I thought you being the heir to Samjeon Group meant you were someone great... I didn't know you were someone who would break a promise with a kid who might become a singer or something, who's just 12 years old.\\" Taeguk looked at Minkuk as if he had made up his mind. \\"Alright, let's sign the contract as it is. The notarization can be done by your side's lawyer.\\" \\"Uncle! Really?\\" \\"I'm not the kind of person who ignores even a 12-year-old kid! Let's proceed with the contract as it is, and stop calling me uncle.\\" \\"We won't know until the stamp is on the contract.\\" Minkuk sharply caught him. Taeguk shook his head in disbelief. \\"You really... seem more ruthless than my brother...\\" \\"I have a long way to go to catch up to my brother.\\" Minkuk grinned and took the contract. * * * The contract with Alibaba's Mount was concluded precisely. Thanks to Representative Son Junghoon advising Mount to give me the same terms as his contract, I also finished signing with the same contract as Representative Son Junghoon. I smiled contentedly looking at the contract. [Let's meet in 10 years! Mount and Representative Son Junghoon!] Knock. Knock. There was a knock on the door. Then, Minkuk's voice was heard. \\"Brother!\\" \\"Just come in. Why knock?\\" \\"I thought you were looking at something... Oh, brother. This contract.\\" \\"The contract with Taeguk's brother?\\" \\"Yeah. Uncle said it was an unfair contract and Samjeon Group was trying to stop it, so I told him, 'Is that all you can do?' and he decided to proceed with this plan as it is. The notarization will be received through our lawyer...\\" [Such a fool...] To proceed with an unfair contract just because of a 12-year-old kid's words. Taeguk, in his past life or this one, always had a green streak. As I shook my head, Minkuk twisted his body in front of me, clearly wanting something. \\"Jeon Minkuk, did you finish your language school homework?\\" \\"Yeah! I finished my homework.\\" \\"We're going to experience a farm nearby this weekend. Go to bed early.\\" \\"Brother...\\" Minkuk blinked his big eyes. \\"Why?\\" \\"Brother, you said you'd show me the video uploading platform last time.\\" He must be talking about YouTube. \\"Why there?\\" \\"I made a contract with Taeguk's uncle. Can't you show me around there?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I stroked my chin. [Should I start the project of making Jeon Minkuk an idol now?] But I couldn't let Minkuk get too excited for no reason. \\"The stamp isn't on the contract yet.\\" \\"Ha... You're even worse than me.\\" A suitable bait was also necessary. \\"If the stamp is on the contract, I'll take you to the YouTube company.\\" \\"Really, brother?\\" \\"Have you ever seen me break a promise?\\" \\"No!\\" Minkuk excitedly jumped around the room. I contacted Chad Chun to arrange a visit to the office over the weekend. Chad Chun gladly agreed. * * * Squish. Minkuk, though a bit old-fashioned, stamped the contract instead of signing. \\"Brother, look.\\" \\"Good job.\\" \\"Chi, how old-fashioned...\\" Taeguk signed the contract with a flourish. [You're the one who's going to fail because of style.] Finally, the historic contract between Jeon Taeguk and Jeon Minkuk was concluded. Both Taeguk and Minkuk looked down at the contract with pride. \\"Is it done now?\\" \\"Yes, brother!\\" Minkuk quickly changed his stance and even smiled brightly. Taeguk struggled to keep his smile down at Minkuk's every word. \\"From now on, just call me brother.\\" \\"Of course, brother!\\" Taeguk glanced at me for a moment. \\"It's the weekend, you're not going to make me work, right?\\" \\"Weekends are for resting. Above all, I value work-life balance.\\" \\"Work-life balance? What's that?\\" In 2004, work-life balance was still a foreign concept in Korea. However, it had been introduced in the United States a few years earlier. \\"You have to live a life balancing work and life. That's how you live happily for a long time.\\" At that moment, I felt Minkuk's sharp gaze, but I pretended not to notice. Taeguk nodded. \\"Nice words. I'll keep that in mind when managing the company in the future, work-life balance. Then, since it's the weekend, I'll take a rest.\\" \\"Do that. Taeguk, even though it's your last week as an intern, remember to prepare for the presentation in front of the chairman and executives.\\" \\"Don't worry, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" Taeguk waved his hand and left the room. I shook my head. At that moment, Minkuk gently tugged at my hand. \\"Brother, you tell Taeguk to maintain work-life balance, but why don't you keep it at all?\\" \\"Minkuk, Taeguk is the son of Samjeon Group's chairman. He was born into unimaginable wealth without having to work. But you and I are not.\\" \\"Uh...\\" Minkuk nodded. \\"People born into poverty like us have to work several times harder to succeed.\\" \\"Brother...\\" \\"Yes?\\" \\"Is making a lot of money your dream?\\" \\"That's...\\" [Of course, why are you asking?] I looked at Minkuk curiously. \\"Brother, my dream is to become an idol like HAT. To sing, dance, and rap on stage. But you're only 14. Well, you look about the same age as Cheolsu or Taeguk. Anyway...\\" Minkuk stared at me intently. [Why are you looking at me so pitifully?] \\"Brother, I want to become a pilot when I ride a plane, and I want to become a lawyer when I meet a lawyer. But, brother, it's strange that making a lot of money is your dream. Money is the result of work, not the goal, right?\\" \\"......\\" I was at a loss for words. Money is the result of work, not the goal? I inwardly smiled bitterly. [Is an IQ of 160 really different? Ah- I guess my mere IQ of 120 is indeed lacking.] Minkuk tightly held my hand. \\"Brother, sometimes I wish you were like my friends' brothers, who are childish and throw tantrums.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I stared at Minkuk. I knew my brother Jeon Minkuk too well. When he talks like an adult, pretending to understand others' hearts, he definitely has a purpose. \\"Jeon Minkuk, what do you want?\\" \\"Hehe, brother, how did you know?\\" [Brother might not be as smart as you, but I have the wisdom of life.] \\"Tell me.\\" \\"Brother, before I go back to Korea after the language course, I want to go to Disneyland together. I bragged to my friends that I would go to Disneyland in the US.\\" \\"Jeon Minkuk, you have a final exam at the language school in the last week, right?\\" \\"Brother, how did you know?\\" Minkuk's eyes shook violently. \\"Brother found out everything by calling.\\" \\"Brother, you're not going to...?\\" Minkuk became increasingly anxious. \\"If you score over 90 on the final exam at the language school, I'll take you to Disneyland.\\" \\"Brother, that's too much!\\" \\"If you don't like it, you can't go to Disneyland at all. Will you accept this offer or not?\\" \\"Brother, you're mean!\\" \\"If you don't like it, forget it.\\" Minkuk clenched his mouth shut and then glared at me with angry eyes. \\"Alright! Alright! If it's over 90, that's fine!\\" \\"Minkuk, you're smart, so with a little effort, you can easily score over 90.\\" \\"Brother, don't give me the disease and then the cure.\\" Minkuk walked into his room with slumped shoulders, glancing back at me with resentful eyes. I smiled at Minkuk's figure. [Jeon Minkuk, there's no such thing as a free lunch in this world! Even siblings are no exception. Money may not be the goal of life, but remember, without money, even the opportunity to dream disappears!] * * * The YouTube office was not far from the Apple campus. Located on the second floor of a low-rise building, the trees outside the window seemed within reach. The office was about the same size as 'Face Note', but had more employees. Even though it was the weekend, everyone was busy working. \\"Chad, everyone's here even on the weekend?\\" \\"Yeah... We're aiming to open next year, so it's been hectic lately. We're about to start the beta service soon. By the way, is this little guy your brother?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Chad Chun greeted Minkuk warmly. \\"Minkuk, nice to meet you. You wanted to see around here?\\" \\"Yes, my brother said you can upload your own videos on this platform.\\" \\"Wow, Minkuk is really interested in this.\\" \\"My dream is to be a singer. Not just a singer, but one who dances too.\\" \\"Like NSYNC?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Minkuk answered loudly. That made the employees at the YouTube office smile pleasantly. Chad Chun pondered for a moment and then looked at me. \\"Sunguk, how about your brother uploads a video of him singing or dancing for the upcoming beta service?\\" [That's exactly what I wanted, Chad.] Minkuk held my hand tightly, wanting to do it. \\"Brother...\\" \\"Chad, if we film it with a digital camera and upload it, will that work?\\" \\"Yeah. You can upload it in any convenient way. It would be nice to use video editing software, but it's not necessary at this early stage. We're actually recruiting people to upload videos in various fields. It would be great if Minkuk could do it. Our channel thrives on diversity.\\" I looked down at Minkuk. \\"Minkuk, want to try?\\" \\"Yes, brother!\\" Minkuk raised his hand high. * * * \\"Brother, you have to film it properly. Got it?\\" \\"Yep, got it.\\" I started filming Minkuk's video with the digital camera my dad gave me when he said to take lots of pictures when coming to the US. In the living room of the dormitory, Minkuk started dancing his best to a popular Korean song. Thump thump thump. The loud beat filled the dormitory early on a Sunday morning. Mark spoke from behind. \\"Sunguk, what are you doing?\\" \\"Oh, sorry. Is it too loud?\\" \\"I was about to get up to work anyway.\\" Suddenly, Mark was captivated by Minkuk dancing. Soon, Limimi also sat next to him, drinking coffee and watching Minkuk in a trance. When Minkuk's dance ended, everyone clapped. \\"Minkuk! Amazing!\\" Mark's cheer made Minkuk shrug his shoulders. [Is blood thicker than water after all? Even the habits are similar...] \\"Boss, can I see the video you filmed? I've been a fan of Korean dramas and K-pop idols.\\" \\"Limimi, please watch it and give us your honest opinion.\\" Honestly, from my perspective as a former JP trainee who trained for a month, Minkuk's dance lacked fundamentals. It was a dance blindly copied from TV idols, so the basics were absolutely lacking. \\"Limimi, what do you think?\\" \\"Well... The basics seem a bit weak. But there's a bigger problem.\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"The video quality is terrible, boss!\\" This was an unexpected answer. \\"Sunguk, how about buying a camera for your brother? If Minkuk dreams of being a singer, he'll need to film a lot of videos for various auditions in the future...\\" \\"Hmm...\\" It wasn't that I was reluctant to spend the money, but I doubted that camera quality was a major issue in audition success. At that moment, the doorbell rang. Young Secretary Yang and Jeon Taeguk appeared. I quickly opened the door. And I welcomed Taeguk more warmly than ever. \\"Welcome! What brings you here so early in the morning?\\" \\"I heard music and thought there was a party going on, so I came to see.\\" Taeguk spoke casually. Minkuk also welcomed Taeguk from behind. \\"Brother! I'm filming a dance video.\\" \\"Can I see the video too?\\" \\"Of course.\\" I quickly handed the camera to Taeguk. Taeguk watched the video with a serious expression, then scratched his head. \\"The quality is really bad. I brought a new camera from Samjeon that just came out, how about we film it again with that?\\" [Jeon Taeguk, you're truly a global sucker!] Minkuk and I raised our hands and shouted. \\"Great!\\""},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[체계적인 수업만 받으면 금방 늘겠어….] 나는 구경하던 리미미 씨에게 조용히 물었다. “리미미 씨 보기에 민국이 가수 될 가망성이 보이나요?” “사장님, 솔직히 말씀드려도 되죠?” “당연하죠.” “전 이미 팬인데요. 아무래도 오늘부터 북조선 말도 좀 많이 가르쳐줘야겠어요. 가수로 데뷔하면 특기로 써먹게요.” 북조선 출신의 리미미에게는 이미 가능성을 인정받았다. 하지만 나는 민국이는 그저 동양권에서나 인기 있는 가수로 키울 생각은 없었다. 내가 바라는 것은 바로 세계를 석권하는 그런 가수였다. 대한민국 가수 최초로 빌보드 핫100 1위를 하고, 세계 각지의 스타디움을 돌며 투어를 하는 그런 가수. [그 정도는 해야 밥벌이라는 걸 하는 거야, 전민국.] * * * 우리는 모두 모여서 젊은 양 비서가 편집까지 한 동영상을 같이 봤다. 민국이도 두 손을 무릎 위에 가지런히 모으며 떨리는 모습으로 동영상을 시청했다. 동영상 처음은 일반적인 12살 민국이의 모습으로 시작했다. 조금은 떨고 있는 모습이 아직 순수한 민국이의 모습을 엿보이게 했다. 그러고 나서 민국이는 오늘 출 춤과 배경 음악을 설명했다. 한국에서 유행하는 음악이라고 설명하고는 한번 멋쩍게 웃더니 음악이 나오니 금세 진지한 표정을 지었다. [역시 아역 배우 출신답네….] 나는 조금 감탄하면서 민국이 동영상 인트로를 지켜봤다. 곧 민국이의 춤이 시작됐다. 손을 쭉 뻗으며 카메라를 뚫을 듯이 아련하게 바라보는 눈빛. 음악이 시작되자 가사에 맞춰서 변화하는 얼굴 표정. 아직은 어색하지만 최선을 다한다는 게 보이는 영상이었다. 모두들 동영상이 끝나자마자 박수를 쳤다. “와, 대단해. 민국아.” 마크가 입이 마르도록 칭찬을 했다. “좀 하네.” 전태국도 마찬가지였다. 하지만 나는 가장 큰 민국이의 문제점을 알고 있었다. “형아, 왜 아무 말도 없어?” 민국이가 초조한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “흠… 민국아, 내가 JP 한 달 연습생 출신으로 말하자면 말이야. 난 네 춤보다 연기가 더 인상적으로 느껴졌어.” “형아… 그거 나쁜 말이야?” “아니. 한때 네가 내 춤 선생님이기도 했으니까. 춤은 제대로 배우기만 하면 성장할 거야. 근데 정말 배울 수 없는 게 감정이거든. 난 네가 그걸 가지고 있는 것 같아서 정말 좋았어!” “형아….” 민국이는 내 칭찬에 감동한 얼굴이었다. “성국이 말이 맞는 거 같아. 난 미국인이라서 한국 노래 가사도 전혀 모르는데, 민국이 춤을 보면 어떤 느낌인지 알 것 같았거든.” 마크도 격하게 동의했다. 민국이는 자리에서 일어나더니 나에게로 걸어왔다. 그러고는 나를 꼭 안았다. “형아, 고마워.” “민국아, 아직 배워야 할 건 더 많아. 그것만 기억해.” “그게 아니라… 형아, 나한테 칭찬해준 거 처음인 거 알아?” [종종 기특한 일 했을 때 당근 많이 줬던 거 같은데…] 민국이는 눈시울까지 붉어졌다. “형아, 나 정말 형아 동생으로 태어나길 잘한 거 같아.” [당연하지. 나 아니었으면 우리 집도 그렇고, 너도 그렇고. 이런 꿈도 못 꿨을 거야.] 나는 민국이 말 한마디에 그간의 고생이 떠올라 울컥한 마음이 올라왔다. “형아!” “민국아!” 그리고 나와 민국이는 서로를 얼싸안았다. “민국아, 근데 이게 끝이 아니야. 알지? 세계 최고의 가수가 되기 위해서는 더 피땀눈물 나게 연습해야 해.” 순간, 민국이가 눈물을 뚝 그치더니 나를 물끄러미 올려다봤다. “형아, 나는 그냥 대한민국에서 좀 유명한 가수가 되고 싶은 건데…. 꼭 세계 최고가 돼야 해?” “민국아, 무슨 소리야. 대한민국에서 1등도 아니고 좀 유명한 가수가 겨우 목표란 말이야? 하려면 제대로 해야지!” “아니, 형아… 난 가수가 되고 싶은 거지. 꼭 1등을 해야 하는 건 아니잖아….” 민국이의 목소리가 잦아들었다. “민국아, 세상은 1등만 기억한다는 말도 몰라? 빌보드 핫100 1위 정도는 목표로 해야지.” “하아- 역시 형이야. 나 잠시 감동해서 형이 어떤 사람인지 잊을 뻔했네….” 민국이는 축 처진 어깨로 뒤돌아섰다. “민국아, 넌 할 수 있어!” [내가 그렇게 만들고 말 거야!] 나는 민국이의 어깨를 꽉 잡았다. 하지만 민국이는 곧 눈물을 쏟을 듯한 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “형아, 형아가 항상 1등으로 살았다고 나도 1등으로 살 거란 기대는 좀 부담스러워.” 민국이는 그렇게 쓸쓸히 방에 들어가 방문을 닫았다. [내가 좀 심했나?] * * * 마크가 우유를 내밀었다. “성국아, 민국이한테 너무 심한 거 아니야? 아직 가수 시작도 안 한 애한테, 빌보드 1위를 하라는 등, 세계 최고가 되라는 부담을 주는 건 아니지.” “목표는 클수록 좋은 법이잖아. 나는 그 말을 돌려서 한 것뿐이야.” “사장님, 말은 바로 하라고 했다고 돌려서 한 게 아니라 직구로 날리신 건데요.” 리미미도 끼어들었다. “성국아, 민국이한테 네가 사과하는 게 좋을 것 같아. 민국이는 나름 열심히 한다고 했고, 네 칭찬에 감동도 받았는데… 넌 거기다 또 채찍을 휘두른 거잖아.” 데니스가 <채찍>이란 영화의 독재자 같은 교사 역할에 나를 모델로 했단 말이 떠올랐다. 나는 입을 꾹 다물었다. 모두들 나에게만 뭐라고 하니 할 말이 없었다. [아무리 내 안에는 연륜 가득한 전직 삼전 그룹의 부회장이었지만, 나도 상처는 받는다고… 나이 먹는다고 상처에 무뎌지는 건 아니라고….] 나는 아무 말 없이 집을 나섰다. 민국이가 혼자이고 싶듯이, 나도 혼자이고 싶었다. * * * 마크가 걱정스러운 얼굴로 성국이 나간 문을 바라봤다. “미미 씨, 우리가 너무 심했나 봐요.” “사장님이 이해 안 되는 건 아니지만, 다른 사람에게까지 자신의 스타일을 강요할 때가 있긴 하죠. 보면 특히 민국이에게 심한 거 같아요.” “아마, 가족이니까 더 그럴 거예요. 민국이가 잘 되기를 진심으로 바라는 거잖아요.” 전태국이 혀를 쯧쯧 찼다. “나한테는 워라밸 어쩌고 하더니 정작 성국이 본인은 워라밸 하나도 안 지키잖아. 거기다 어린 동생에게도 강요만 하고. 당근과 채찍이 적절해야지. 맨날 채찍만 휘두르니까 민국이가 화날 만도 하지.” 이 상황을 지켜보고 있던 양 비서가 나섰다. “제가 성국이 데리고 올게요. 성국이도 아마 생각 정리할 시간이 필요해서 저럴 거예요.” 젊은 양 비서는 그대로 집을 나섰다. * * * 타닥타닥. 뒤에서 가볍게 뛰어오는 발걸음 소리가 들렸다. [누가 또 따라온 모양이네.] 나는 조금 속도를 늦췄다. 어차피 모퉁이 피자집에 가서 민국이가 좋아하는 피자나 사서 집으로 돌아갈 생각이었다. 내가 또 이성을 잃고 민국이를 몰아세운 모양이었다. 저번 생에 몸에 밴 습관이었는데, 이번 생에서도 잘 고쳐지지 않았다. 발걸음은 내게 가까이 오더니 나의 발걸음 속도에 맞춰서 살짝 속도를 줄이는 게 느껴졌다. 이렇게 세심한 배려를 가진 사람은 저 무리들 속에 단 한 명밖에 없었다. “철수 형이에요?” 뒤돌아서는 순간, 나보다 덩치가 두 배나 큰 낯선 얼굴의 사내가 내 앞에 서 있었다. 사내에게서는 고개가 저절로 돌아갈 정도로 악취가 났다. 금발 머리는 떡이 져 있었고, 성한 이는 하나도 없었다. 딱 봐도 마약에 중독된 쓰레기였다. 사내는 손을 벌벌 떨면서 내밀었다. “돈, 돈 있어?” “아, 그게….” 나는 너무 당황한 나머지 온몸이 굳어버리고 말았다. 저번 생에서는 보디가드나 젊은 양 비서가 항상 곁에 있었기 때문에 이런 위험한 일을 당할 일 자체가 없었다. 이번 생에서는 나름 안전한 곳에서 생활하다 보니 내가 너무 방심한 모양이었다. “돈 있냐고! 이 동양 놈아!” 마약 중독자는 나에게 소리를 질렀다. 나는 떨리는 돈으로 주머니를 뒤적였다. 피자 살 돈 백 불이 있었다. 나는 얼른 사내에게 돈을 내밀었다. 사내는 돈을 빼앗듯 가로채더니 빙긋 웃으며 나에게 한 걸음 더 다가왔다. [저리 가라고!] 하지만 이렇게 소리쳤다가는 쥐도 새도 모르게 죽을 수도 있었다. “너 돈 많구나? 돈 더 있지?” “없어요. 그게 전부에요. 진짜예요!” 나는 나도 모르게 뒷걸음질을 쳤다. 사내는 그럴수록 내게 다가왔다. [총은 없나?] 다행히 총은 없는 것 같았다. 그 순간, 사내가 주머니를 뒤적이더니 깨진 와인 병 입구를 꺼내 들었다. 충분히 위협적인 무기였다. 설마, 이번 생은 여기서 끝인가? [마흔도 요절인데, 14살에 요절이면 너무 억울하잖아! 내가 얼마나 개고생해서 흙수저 집안을 일으켜 세워놨는데!] 그 순간, 오기가 생겼다. 이렇게 당하고만 있을 수는 없었다. 나는 얼른 주변을 살폈다. 옆은 공원이라 어둑했고, 산책하는 사람도 잘 안 보였다. 무기가 될 만한 건 거의 보이지 않았지만, 미친 듯이 달린다면 살 수도 있을 것 같았다. 내 앞의 사내는 흉기를 들고 있긴 했지만, 마약 중독자라 분명 쓰레기 같은 체력을 소유자일 터였다. “야, 동양인. 돈 있는 거 다 내놔, 어서!” 나는 주머니를 뒤지는 시늉을 했다. 백 달러가 전부이긴 했지만, 시간을 벌기 위해서였다. 나는 슬쩍 공원 쪽으로 뒷걸음치다 그만 조각난 보도블록에 걸려 뒤로 나자빠지고 말았다. 사내는 비릿한 미소를 지으며 내게 점점 다가왔다. [아, 제발… 이대로 죽을 수는 없다고!] 나는 깨진 보도블록을 손에 쥐었다. [죽어도 나 혼자는 안 간다!] 내가 보도블록을 쥐는 것을 본 사내가 깨진 와인 병을 휘두르며 달려들었다. “이 새끼가 어디서 수작이야!” 그때였다. 퍽- 퍽- 소리가 들렸다. 사내가 그대로 고꾸라지는 게 보였다. 나는 정신을 다잡고 어둠 속에 선 두 사람을 바라봤다. 어둠 속에서 모습을 드러낸 두 사람은 바로 양 비서와 민국이였다. “성국아, 괜찮아?” 이때, 사내가 다시 정신을 차리고 일어서려고 하자 민국이가 한 손에 든 프라이팬으로 사내의 머리를 있는 힘껏 내려쳤다. “우리 형아한테 못된 짓 하면 내가 가만 안 둘 거야!”","output":"Episode 152 Jeon Taeguk proudly presented the latest digital camera from Samjeon Electronics. \\"It's the latest model. It has the best resolution among domestic cameras. It's fair to say it's packed with our Samjeon's technology.\\" \\"Ah, yes….\\" I picked up the digital camera. I was well aware of this digital camera. It was created by cherry-picking the advantages of a popular foreign brand's digital camera at the time, aiming to capture the hearts of the Dotori World generation. However, although technology can be copied, emotions cannot, leading to a disastrously failed product. Young Secretary Yang grabbed the camera. \\"Seongguk, I've used this camera a lot before it went on sale for testing. Can I film Minguk?\\" \\"Of course, that's fine.\\" At that moment, Minguk slowly approached me. \\"Brother….\\" \\"What?\\" \\"It seems like more people are gathering.\\" \\"Minguk, your dream is to be a singer on stage, right? You'll perform in front of tens, hundreds, and later tens of thousands of people, so you can't be embarrassed.\\" I firmly grasped Minguk's shoulder. Minguk clenched his fists and nodded. \\"I can do it!\\" Minguk had a strong fighting spirit, except when it came to studying. I wanted to believe in that fighting spirit of his. * * * \\"Let's take it one more time.\\" I discovered an unexpected side of Young Secretary Yang. He was a perfectionist. Now, Minguk was dancing the same dance to the same song for the fifth time. \\"Huff- Huff- Huff-\\" Drenched in sweat, Minguk glared at Young Secretary Yang. \\"Cheolsu hyung, isn't this too much?\\" \\"It was all good, but you put too much strength after the middle part. Let's do that part one more time.\\" Jeon Taeguk shook his head in disapproval. \\"It's a good thing Yang Secretary is my secretary. If he were my boss, I wouldn't have been able to survive.\\" [You're lucky to know, Jeon Taeguk.] Thinking back, Yang Secretary's support in my previous life was nearly perfect. My schedule was always accurate to the minute. Moreover, while filming, Young Secretary Yang naturally directed Minguk's dance and movements. \\"Minguk, how about you collapse on the floor drenched in sweat after finishing the dance?\\" \\"Cheolsu hyung. I feel like I'll really collapse if I do it one more time.\\" \\"Let's do it with that mindset, just one more time!\\" Young Secretary Yang started filming again. Minguk, despite sweating like rain, began to dance passionately once more. After several takes, the dance moves that didn't match began to align, and the awkward parts started to look more organized. [With systematic lessons, he'll improve quickly….] I quietly asked Limimi, who was watching. \\"Limimi, do you see any potential in Minguk becoming a singer?\\" \\"Boss, may I speak frankly?\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"I'm already a fan. I guess I'll have to teach him a lot of North Korean phrases from today. It'll be useful as a special skill when he debuts as a singer.\\" Minguk was already recognized for his potential by Limimi, who was from North Korea. However, I didn't just want to raise Minguk as a singer popular only in the East Asian region. What I wanted was a singer who would conquer the world. A singer who would be the first from South Korea to top the Billboard Hot 100 and tour stadiums around the world. [That's what you call making a living, Jeon Minguk.] * * * We all gathered to watch the video edited by Young Secretary Yang. Minguk also watched the video with his hands neatly placed on his knees, his face trembling. The video started with the typical appearance of 12-year-old Minguk. His slightly nervous appearance allowed a glimpse of the innocent Minguk. Then, Minguk explained today's dance and background music. He mentioned it was popular music in Korea, then awkwardly smiled before becoming serious as the music started. [He really is like a child actor….] I watched Minguk's video intro with a bit of admiration. Soon, Minguk's dance began. His eyes piercing through the camera as he stretched his arms. As the music started, his facial expressions changed with the lyrics. Although still awkward, the video showed his best effort. Everyone clapped as soon as the video ended. \\"Wow, that's amazing. Minguk.\\" Mark praised him endlessly. \\"Not bad.\\" Jeon Taeguk felt the same. However, I knew Minguk's biggest problem. \\"Brother, why aren't you saying anything?\\" Minguk looked at me anxiously. \\"Hmm… Minguk, speaking as a former JP trainee for a month, I was more impressed by your acting than your dance.\\" \\"Brother… is that a bad thing?\\" \\"No. You were once my dance teacher, after all. If you learn properly, you'll improve in dancing. But what you can't learn is emotion. I was really happy to see that you have it!\\" \\"Brother….\\" Minguk's face was moved by my praise. \\"Seongguk's right. I'm American, so I don't understand Korean lyrics at all, but watching Minguk dance, I felt like I could understand the feeling.\\" Mark strongly agreed. Minguk stood up and walked towards me. Then, he hugged me tightly. \\"Brother, thank you.\\" \\"Minguk, there's still a lot more to learn. Just remember that.\\" \\"It's not that… Brother, it's the first time you've praised me, you know?\\" [I thought I gave you plenty of carrots when you did something praiseworthy…] Minguk's eyes began to tear up. \\"Brother, I really feel lucky to be born as your brother.\\" [Of course. If it weren't for me, both our family and you wouldn't have been able to dream like this.] Minguk's single comment brought back memories of all the hardships, making me feel emotional. \\"Brother!\\" \\"Minguk!\\" And Minguk and I hugged each other tightly. \\"Minguk, but this isn't the end. You know that, right? To become the world's best singer, you have to practice until you sweat blood.\\" Suddenly, Minguk stopped crying and looked up at me. \\"Brother, I just want to be a somewhat famous singer in South Korea… Do I really have to be the world's best?\\" \\"Minguk, what are you talking about? Being just somewhat famous in South Korea isn't a goal. If you're going to do it, you have to do it right!\\" \\"No, brother… I just want to be a singer. It doesn't have to be number one….\\" Minguk's voice trailed off. \\"Minguk, don't you know the world only remembers number one? You should aim for at least Billboard Hot 100 number one.\\" \\"Ha- It's just like you, brother. I was momentarily moved and almost forgot what kind of person you are….\\" Minguk turned around with slumped shoulders. \\"Minguk, you can do it!\\" [I'll make sure of it!] I firmly grasped Minguk's shoulder. But Minguk soon looked at me with a face about to cry. \\"Brother, it's a bit burdensome to expect me to live as number one just because you always lived as number one.\\" Minguk then sadly entered his room and closed the door. [Did I go too far?] * * * Mark handed me a glass of milk. \\"Seongguk, weren't you too harsh? Giving such a burden to a kid who hasn't even started as a singer, telling him to be number one in the world.\\" \\"The bigger the goal, the better. I was just saying it in a roundabout way.\\" \\"Boss, that wasn't roundabout at all. You threw a fastball.\\" Limimi also joined in. \\"Seongguk, I think it would be good for you to apologize to Minguk. He tried his best, and he was moved by your praise… but then you whipped him again.\\" Dennis's words about the movie <Whip>, where he modeled a tyrannical teacher after me, came to mind. I clenched my mouth shut. Everyone was scolding me, leaving me speechless. [Even if I have the experience of a former vice chairman of Samjeon Group, I still get hurt… Getting older doesn't make you immune to pain….] I left the house without saying a word. Like Minguk wanted to be alone, I wanted to be alone too. * * * Mark looked worriedly at the door Seongguk had exited through. \\"Mimi, maybe we were too harsh.\\" \\"It's not that I don't understand the boss, but sometimes he does impose his style on others. Especially on Minguk, it seems harsh.\\" \\"Probably because they're family. He sincerely wishes for Minguk to do well.\\" Jeon Taeguk clicked his tongue. \\"He talks about work-life balance to me, but he doesn't practice it himself. Plus, he only imposes on his young brother. You need a balance of carrot and stick. Minguk has every right to be angry since he's only been whipped.\\" Young Secretary Yang stepped forward. \\"I'll go bring Seongguk back. He probably needs time to sort out his thoughts.\\" Young Secretary Yang then left the house. * * * Tap-tap. I heard light footsteps running up behind me. [Someone's following me again.] I slowed down a bit. I was planning to go to the corner pizza shop and buy Minguk's favorite pizza before heading home. It seemed I had lost my temper and pushed Minguk too hard again. It was a habit from my previous life that hadn't been corrected in this life. The footsteps came closer and matched my pace. There was only one person among them who had such considerate manners. \\"Cheolsu hyung?\\" As I turned around, a man twice my size with an unfamiliar face stood in front of me. The man reeked so badly it made me want to turn away. His blond hair was greasy, and he didn't have a single healthy tooth. He was clearly a drug addict. The man trembled as he extended his hand. \\"Money, do you have money?\\" \\"Ah, well….\\" I was so startled that my body froze. In my previous life, I always had bodyguards or Young Secretary Yang by my side, so I never faced such dangerous situations. In this life, I had been living in relatively safe places, so it seemed I had let my guard down. \\"Got money? Give it to me, you Asian!\\" The drug addict yelled at me. I fumbled in my pocket, trembling. I had a hundred dollars for pizza. I quickly handed the money to the man. He snatched the money and grinned, stepping closer to me. [Go away!] But yelling at him might get me killed without anyone knowing. \\"You got more money? Give me all you have.\\" \\"I don't have any more. That's all I have. Really!\\" I instinctively stepped back. The man kept approaching as I did. [Does he have a gun?] Fortunately, it seemed he didn't have a gun. Then, the man rummaged in his pocket and pulled out the broken neck of a wine bottle. It was a sufficiently threatening weapon. Was this the end of my life? [It's too unfair to die at 14 after dying at forty in my previous life! I've worked so hard to lift my dirt-poor family up!] Suddenly, I felt determined. I couldn't just let this happen. I quickly scanned my surroundings. The park next to me was dark, and there were hardly any people walking around. There was almost nothing that could be used as a weapon, but if I ran desperately, I might survive. The man in front of me had a weapon, but as a drug addict, he must have been a weakling. \\"Hey, Asian. Give me all your money, now!\\" I pretended to search my pockets. Although a hundred dollars was all I had, I needed to buy time. I slowly backed towards the park, but I tripped over a broken sidewalk block and fell backward. The man smirked and approached me even closer. [Please… I can't die like this!] I grabbed a broken sidewalk block. [Even if I die, I won't go alone!] Seeing me grab the block, the man charged at me, swinging the broken wine bottle. \\"You dare mess with me!\\" That's when it happened. Thump- Thump- The sound was heard. The man collapsed right there. I gathered my senses and saw two figures standing in the darkness. The two people who emerged from the darkness were none other than Yang Secretary and Minguk. \\"Seongguk, are you okay?\\" As the man tried to get up again, Minguk hit the man's head with the frying pan he was holding with all his might. \\"If you mess with my brother, I won't let you off!\\""},{"instruction":"Hello there!","output":"Hello!

[전민국, 어쩌냐. 보나 마나 인기 투표는 내가 이길 게 뻔한데. 나, 전성국이야. 프롬킹도 한 사람이라고….] 나는 민국이의 저 의지를 짓밟는 형이 되고 싶지는 않았다. 젊은 양 비서가 나와 민국이를 번갈아 보더니 입을 열었다. “민국아, 이런 작은 거에 너무 심각해질 필요는 없어. 동영상을 올리는 목적은 사람들의 호응도랑 네가 부족한 점을 알아서 앞으로 어떻게 발전하면 될지를 확인하는 거잖아.” 젊은 양 비서의 말이 백번 맞다. 하지만 민국이는 물러설 기미가 보이지 않았다. “나도 형을 한번 꼭 이겨보고 싶어요.” 민국이는 두 손을 꼭 쥐었다. [민국아, 이미 넌 아이큐로 나를 이겼어….] 하지만 이건 정말 무덤까지 가지고 갈 나의 치부였다. 나는 입을 꼭 다물었다. 젊은 양 비서가 안타까운 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 네가 민국이 설득해봐.” “흠… 인기 투표는 하되, 민국아 벌칙을 조금 낮추자. 예를 들면 진 사람이 매일 방 청소를 한다든가. 그런 거 있잖아. 솔직히 지금은 누가 봐도 내가 이길 게 뻔하잖아. 넌 아직 12살에 귀여운 것 빼고는 얼굴도 형보다 못하고, 키도 나보다 작잖아.” “성국아….” 젊은 양 비서의 두 눈이 휘둥그레졌다. [사람들은 꼭 진실을 말하면 이러더라. 내가 이러니 속으로 중얼거리는 것을 끊을 수가 없지!] “뭐, 그럼 어쩔 수 없죠. 철수 형, 전 민국이의 의견을 따를게요. 민국이도 자신이 원하는 대로 해봤으면 좋겠어요.” “형아, 나 이번에 진짜 자신 있어!” 젊은 양 비서도 체념한 듯했다. “형제 모두의 의견이 그렇다면 우선 일상 동영상을 찍어보자. 성국이는 주인공이 아니니까, 민국이 에피소드에 등장하는 정도면 어떨까?” [그래도 내가 더 주목받을 건 뻔하지만. 한번 해보지.] 나는 애써 어깨를 쭉 내렸다. “철수 형, 그럼 가수가 꿈인 대한민국 소년의 미국 어학연수라는 콘셉트로 동영상을 찍어보는 게 어떨까요?” “제목이야 좀 더 관심을 끌 수 있으면 좋으니까. 대한민국 소년의 빌보드 공략. 뭐, 이런 제목을 쓰면 더 많이 볼 것 같아.” [역시 양 비서야.] 젊은 양 비서는 확실히 연예 비지니스 쪽에 재능이 있었다. “카메라는 나도 찍긴 할 건데, 민국이가 셀프 카메라 찍는 형식으로 하면 더 좋을 것 같아. 카메라에 대고 친구들에게 편하게 이야기하듯이 떠들면 사람들이 더 친근하게 느낄 것 같아.” “저 그런 거 엄청 잘해요!” 민국이는 디지털카메라를 들더니 이리저리 자신의 얼굴이 제일 잘 나오게 각도를 맞췄다. “형아, 이게 바로 얼짱 각도라는 거야.” 찰칵. 찰칵. 찰칵. 민국이는 셀카를 여러 장 찍어서는 곧 자신의 ‘페이스 노트’에 올렸다. * * * “안녕하세요. 전민국의 하루를 여러분과 오늘 공유해 보려고 해요. 그럼, 10년 후에 빌보드를 정복하는 가수가 될 전민국의 하루를 시작하겠습니다!” 민국이는 발랄한 미소를 지으며 카메라를 놓고 일상을 찍었다. “제 일상은요. 아침에 일어나서 일하다 늦게 잠든 형아를 깨우는 일부터 시작해요.” 민국이는 웬일로 새벽같이 일어나서는 나를 흔들어 깨우기 시작했다. “형아, 일어나. 아침이야! 회사 출근해야지! 형아!” 나는 부스스한 눈으로 이불을 걷어차면서 상체를 일으켰다. 순간, 민국이가 놀라서 버럭 소리를 질렀다. “형아! 이건 반칙이잖아! 왜! 웃통을 벗고 있어!” 이 순간을 위해서 나는 어젯밤 잠옷도 안 입고 상의를 벗은 채 잠들었다. “전민국, 너도 반칙이잖아. 네가 언제부터 날 깨웠어? 내가 맨날 널 깨웠지! 동영상이라고 거짓말로 막 찍으면 돼? 안 돼?” “진짜! 형아 못됐어.” 민국이는 카메라를 꺼버렸다. * * * 문을 열고 나가자 리미미가 주방에서 커피를 내리고 있었다. 그러곤 나를 보자 피식 웃었다. “사장님, 그렇게 꼭 동생한테도 이겨야겠어요?” “경쟁에 형, 동생이 어디 있어요?” “진짜 형제가 아주 승부욕이 장난 아니에요.” 나는 냉장고에서 우유를 꺼내 벌컥 들이켰다. 곧 민국이가 한 손에 디지털카메라를 들고나와서 나를 한번 째려보고는 가식적인 미소를 지으며 리미미를 찍었다. “여기는 저희 형아 회사에 다니는 리미미 누나예요. 누나는 북한 출신이세요. 누나, 카메라에다 대고 인사 한번 해주세요.” “안녕하세요! 우리 민국이 많이 사랑해 주세요!” 마침, 부스스한 얼굴의 마크도 방문을 열고 나왔다. “마크 형! 여기 카메라 좀 봐주세요.” “민국아, 찍으면 안 돼! 나 엉망이야!” 쾅. 마크는 그대로 문을 닫고 들어갔다. 민국이는 카메라에 대고 연신 종알거렸다. “마크 형이 뭐라고 하는지는 잘 모르겠지만, 찍지 말라고 하는 것 같네요. 이상! 제가 미국에서 지내는 숙소는 형아가 일하는 회사 사람들이 함께 사는 숙소예요. 그럼, 이따 또 만나요!” 민국이는 카메라에다 대고 연신 손을 흔들었다. 나는 혀를 끌끌 찼다. “민국아, 너무 오버하지 마.” “형아나 오버하지 마. 오늘은 꼭 잠옷 입고 자!” 민국이는 투덜거리며 방으로 들어갔다. 나는 고개를 저었다. 곧 민국이가 방에서 내 핸드폰을 들고나왔다. “형아, 전화 받아! 아침부터 진짜 시끄러워 죽겠어!” 민국이는 핸드폰을 건네곤 또다시 툴툴거리며 방 안으로 들어갔다. 나는 얼른 핸드폰을 봤다. 일론 머스트였다. 무슨 일이지? * * * 일론 머스트는 자신이 천재를 또 한 명 만났다면 들뜬 목소리로 나에게 자신이 알려주는 위치로 올 것을 부탁했다. 나는 반신반의한 마음으로 일론 머스트가 알려준 실리콘밸리의 사무실로 향했다. 일론 머스트가 알려준 건물은 벤처 회사들이 모여 있는 실리콘밸리의 수많은 건물 중 하나였다. 일론 머스트가 망상가이기는 하지만, 범죄자는 아니어서 나는 별 의심 없이 사무실 문 앞에 섰다. 그리고 문을 두드렸다. 곧 일론 머스트가 상기된 얼굴로 나를 맞았다. “성국! 어서 와!” “일론, 아침부터 무슨 일이에요?” “성국! 내가 정말 멋진 사람을 만났어. 난 이 사람이 너만큼 천재 같거든. 그래서 소개해주고 싶어서 이렇게 불렀지.” 누구지? 나는 의심 가득한 마음으로 좁은 사무실 안으로 들어갔다. 사무실은 몇 대의 컴퓨터가 놓여있는 책상과 서점을 옮겨놓은 것 같은 한쪽 벽. 그리고 몇 개의 간단한 의자들이 놓인 사무실이라기보다는 교수의 방 같은 느낌이었다. 거기에는 동양인인 것 같으면서도 미국인인 것 같은 남자가 한 명 있었다. 나이는 일론의 또래로 보였다. 남자는 자리에서 일어나더니 손을 내밀었다. “일론한테 이야기 많이 들었어요… 난 제임스 사카모토예요.” [제임스 사카모토? 설마 비트코인의 창시자!] 비트코인의 창시자는 사카모토라는 이름으로 활동했고, 아무도 그 실체를 몰랐다. 나는 순간 얼음이 된 채 제임스를 뚫어져라 쳐다봤다. “성국, 왜 그래?” “아, 아니요. 죄송합니다. 이름이 독특해서요. 전성국입니다. 한국 사람이에요.” “일론한테 들었어요. 전 미국 사람이긴 한데, 아버지가 일본 사람이거든요. 아버지랑은 어릴 적 헤어져서 솔직히 얼굴도 기억도 안 나요. 그래도 어쨌든 성은 성이니까요.” 제임스 사카모토는 일본인 아버지와 미국인 어머니 사이에서 태어났다고 한다. 일본에서 유학 온 아버지와 사랑에 빠진 어머니는 결혼까지 해서 제임스를 낳았지만, 일본의 전통적인 사고방식과 맞지 않아서 제임스가 세 살 때 이혼했다고 한다. 그 길로 아버지는 일본으로 돌아가서 다시는 미국에 오지 않았다고 한다. “처음 만난 사람들은 영어를 엄청 잘하는 일본인 정도로 저를 생각하기도 해요. 하지만 전 미국에서 태어나서 미국 땅을 거의 벗어난 적이 없어요. 대학생 때 배낭 메고 유럽 간 거 빼고는요.” 제임스 사카모토는 약간 일론과 비슷한 면이 있었다. 아버지와 어릴 적 헤어진 점. 그리고 자신의 치부일 수 있는 이야기를 남들에게 스스럼없이 하는 것이었다. 하지만 다른 면도 있었다. “참, 오늘 여기서 할 이야기는 아마 평생 우리만 아는 이야기가 될 거예요. 그래서 계약서를 작성했으면 해요.” 그러곤 나와 일론에게 계약서를 내밀었다. [철저한 성격은 나와 같네, 제임스.] 계약서의 내용은 다음과 같았다. - 오늘 이 자리에서 나눈 모두 대화는 비밀로 간직한다. 만약 이 이야기를 후에 유출한 것이 밝혀질 때는 1억 달러의 손해배상을 한다. 일종의 비밀 서약이었다. 일론이 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “1억 달러라고? 제임스 너무 하잖아.” “일론. 그만큼 이건 중요한 이야기야.” “아직 발명도 안 해놓고는 무슨….” 일론은 작게 타박을 했다. 하지만 제임스는 물러설 생각이 없었다. “만약 지금 준비 중인 가상 화폐가 세상에 나오기만 한다면 사람들은 나를 찾으려고 안달이 될 거야. 그러면, 난 정말 생명의 위협을 느낄 일도 수없이 많을 거고… 어차피 실패하면 아무 소용없는 거지만, 성공할 때는 대비 안 할 수도 없어. 이건 가상 화폐 모임의 불문율이기도 해.” 나는 떨리는 심정으로 계약서를 받아들었다. “제임스, 가상 화폐 모임이라면 이걸 개발하는 사람이 한두 명이 아닌 거예요?” “여러 명이 있어. 그중에서 서로의 신분을 아는 사람은 거의 없지만, 우린 모두 이 계약서에 사인을 한 상태야. 나중에 가상 화폐가 실제로 세상에 퍼지게 되면, 분명 사람들은 미친 듯이 가상 화폐에 투자를 시작할 거고… 개발자인 우리를 찾으려고 할 거잖아.” “근데 일론이랑은 어떻게 이야기가 되신 거예요?” “사실은 내가 테슬론과 스페이스 Z에 관심이 많거든. 자율주행하는 전기자동차나 우주여행. 마치 공상 과학 영화 속에나 있을 법한 일을 벌이는 미치광이라면 나와 통할 것 같아서….” 가상 화폐 열풍이 일었을 때 일각에서는 일론 머스트가 가상화폐의 발명가인 사카모토일 것이라는 추측이 있었다. 일론이 짹짹이에다가 가상 화폐에 대한 언급을 일삼았기 때문이다. 일론이 나를 슬쩍 쳐다봤다. “성국, 난 당연히 사인할 거야. 난 제임스한테 이 가상 화폐에 대해서 더 깊은 이야기를 듣고 싶거든.” “제임스. 이건 너무 불공정한 계약 같은데요. 침묵에는 대가가 따르는 거잖아요.” 제임스가 빙긋 웃었다. “일론이 말한 대로 천재네. 흠… 침묵의 대가로 가상 화폐를 발명하면 100 가상 화폐를 줄게. 어때?” “좋아요. 그럼, 제임스. 계약서도 좀 고칠까요?” 나는 얼른 계약서에 첨부할 내용을 덧붙였다. - 이 대화의 비밀 조건으로 제임스 사카모토는 가상 화폐를 발명하는 순간 일론 머스트와 전성국에서 100개의 가상 화폐를 아무 조건 없이 증여한다. 제임스 사카모토는 빙긋 미소를 지었다. “일론 말처럼 빈틈없는 천재네. ‘페이스 노트’ 나도 잘 보고 있어. 아마 두 사람은 10년 후쯤 세계에서 가장 부자가 되어 있을 것 같아.” [그건 나도 아는 이야기라고…] 제임스 사카모토는 얼른 계약서를 다시 작성했고, 나와 일론은 사인을 마쳤다. 그리고 나는 비트코인의 창시자로부터 그 시작의 거대한 내용을 직접 들을 수 있었다. 아마 이 이야기는 평생 나와 일론 그리고 소수의 사람들만이 알게 될 역사의 한 페이지였다.","output":"Episode 154 Minguk's expression was more determined than ever. Or perhaps it was the most serious I had ever seen Minguk in my life. Does that mean he was really serious about this popularity vote? [Jeon Minguk, what can we do? It's obvious I'm going to win the popularity vote. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Even the prom king is just one person...] I didn't want to become the brother who trampled on Minguk's will. Young Secretary Yang looked back and forth between me and Minguk before opening his mouth. \\"Minguk, you don't need to take such a small thing too seriously. The purpose of uploading videos is to check people's responses and what you lack, so you can figure out how to improve in the future.\\" Young Secretary Yang's words were absolutely right. However, Minguk showed no signs of backing down. \\"I also want to win against my brother at least once.\\" Minguk clenched his fists tightly. [Minguk, you've already beaten me with your IQ...] But this was truly my shameful secret that I would take to the grave. I kept my mouth shut. Young Secretary Yang looked at me with a pitying face. \\"Seongguk, try to persuade Minguk.\\" \\"Hmm... Let's do the popularity vote, but let's lower the penalty a bit. For example, the loser has to clean the room every day. You know, stuff like that. Honestly, it's obvious I'm going to win right now. You're only 12, aside from being cute, your face and height are both less than mine.\\" \\"Seongguk...\\" Young Secretary Yang's eyes widened in shock. [People always react like this when you tell the truth. This is why I can't stop muttering to myself!] \\"Well, then it can't be helped. Cheolsu hyung, I'll follow Minguk's opinion. I hope Minguk does what he wants.\\" \\"Hyung, I'm really confident this time!\\" Young Secretary Yang seemed resigned. \\"If that's what both brothers want, let's start by filming a daily life video. Since Seongguk isn't the main character, how about just appearing in Minguk's episodes?\\" [Still, I'll get more attention. Let's try it.] I deliberately straightened my shoulders. \\"Cheolsu hyung, how about we film a video with the concept of a South Korean boy dreaming of becoming a singer on a language study trip to the USA?\\" \\"The title should be something that can attract more attention. Like, 'The South Korean Boy's Billboard Conquest.' Yeah, using a title like that would get more views.\\" [As expected of Secretary Yang.] Young Secretary Yang definitely had talent in the entertainment business. \\"I'll also film, but it would be better if Minguk films himself with a selfie camera. If he talks to the camera as if he's talking comfortably to friends, people will feel more familiar.\\" \\"I'm really good at that!\\" Minguk picked up the digital camera and adjusted the angle to best capture his face. \\"Hyung, this is what they call the perfect selfie angle.\\" Click. Click. Click. Minguk took several selfies and soon uploaded them to his 'Face Note'. * * * \\"Hello. Today, I want to share a day in the life of Jeon Minguk with you all. So, let's start the day of Jeon Minguk, who will conquer Billboard in 10 years!\\" Minguk started filming his daily life with a lively smile. \\"My daily routine starts with waking up in the morning and waking up my brother who works late.\\" For some reason, Minguk woke up at dawn and started shaking me awake. \\"Hyung, wake up. It's morning! You have to go to work! Hyung!\\" I kicked off the blanket and sat up with groggy eyes. Suddenly, Minguk screamed in surprise. \\"Hyung! That's cheating! Why are you shirtless!\\" I had gone to bed without a pajama top on purpose for this moment. \\"Jeon Minguk, you're cheating too. When have you ever woken me up? I always woke you up! Just because it's a video, you can't just lie. Can you?\\" \\"Really! Hyung, you're mean.\\" Minguk turned off the camera. * * * As I opened the door and went out, Rimimi was making coffee in the kitchen. Then she saw me and chuckled. \\"Boss, do you really have to win even against your brother?\\" \\"In competition, there's no older or younger brother.\\" \\"Real siblings have quite the competitive spirit.\\" I grabbed some milk from the fridge and gulped it down. Soon, Minguk came out with a digital camera in one hand, glared at me once, and then took a contrived smile and filmed Rimimi. \\"This is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, who works at my brother's company. Noona is from North Korea. Noona, please say hello to the camera.\\" \\"Hello! Please love our Minguk a lot!\\" Just then, Mark, with a sleepy face, also came out of his room. \\"Mark hyung! Please look at the camera.\\" \\"Minguk, no! I look terrible!\\" Bang. Mark immediately closed the door and went back in. Minguk kept babbling to the camera. \\"I'm not sure what Mark hyung is saying, but it seems like he's saying not to film. That's it! The place I'm staying in the USA is a dormitory where people from my brother's company live together. See you again later!\\" Minguk waved his hand continuously to the camera. I clicked my tongue. \\"Minguk, don't overdo it.\\" \\"Hyung, don't overdo it. Make sure to wear pajamas tonight!\\" Minguk grumbled and went into his room. I shook my head. Soon, Minguk came out of his room with my phone in his hand. \\"Hyung, answer the phone! It's been really noisy since morning!\\" Minguk handed me the phone and went back into his room, grumbling again. I quickly checked the phone. It was Elon Musk. What's going on? * * * Elon Musk, with an excited voice, asked me to come to the location he provided, saying he had met another genius. With mixed feelings, I headed to the office in Silicon Valley that Elon Musk had told me about. The building Elon Musk mentioned was one of the many buildings in Silicon Valley where venture companies were gathered. Although Elon Musk was a dreamer, he wasn't a criminal, so I stood in front of the office door without much suspicion and knocked. Soon, Elon Musk greeted me with an excited face. \\"Seongguk! Welcome!\\" \\"Elon, what's up so early in the morning?\\" \\"Seongguk! I've met a really cool person. I think this person is as much of a genius as you. So, I wanted to introduce him to you, that's why I called you here.\\" Who is it? With a skeptical heart, I entered the narrow office. The office looked more like a professor's room than an office, with a few computers on desks, one wall looking like a bookstore, and a few simple chairs. There was a man who seemed to be of Asian descent but also American. He appeared to be around Elon's age. The man stood up and extended his hand. \\"I've heard a lot about you from Elon... I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" [James Sakamoto? The creator of Bitcoin!] The creator of Bitcoin operated under the name Sakamoto, and no one knew his real identity. I stared at James as if frozen. \\"Seongguk, what's wrong?\\" \\"Oh, no. Sorry. Your name is unique. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'm Korean.\\" \\"I've heard about you from Elon. I'm American, but my father was Japanese. I was separated from my father when I was young, so I don't really remember his face. But still, a surname is a surname.\\" James Sakamoto was born to a Japanese father and an American mother. His mother fell in love with his father, who came to study in Japan, and they got married and had James. However, due to the traditional Japanese mindset not matching, they divorced when James was three years old. After that, his father returned to Japan and never came back to the US. \\"People meeting me for the first time think I'm a Japanese who speaks English very well. But I was born in the US and have hardly ever left the country, except for backpacking in Europe during college.\\" James Sakamoto had some similarities with Elon. Separated from his father at a young age. And the fact that he openly talked about what could be his flaws to others. But there were also differences. \\"Anyway, the conversation we're going to have today will probably remain a secret known only to us for a lifetime. So, I'd like to draft a contract.\\" Then, he handed Elon and me a contract. [Just like me, James has a meticulous personality.] The content of the contract was as follows: - All conversations shared in this place today will be kept confidential. If it is later revealed that this story has been leaked, a penalty of 100 million dollars will be imposed. It was a kind of secret oath. Elon shook his head. \\"100 million dollars? James, that's too much.\\" \\"Elon. This conversation is that important.\\" \\"We haven't even invented it yet, and you're talking about...\\" Elon lightly scolded him. However, James was not willing to back down. \\"If the virtual currency we're currently preparing for is released to the world, people will go crazy trying to find me. Then, I'll really feel threatened for my life countless times... It's useless if it fails, but if it succeeds, we can't not prepare. This is also an unwritten rule of the virtual currency community.\\" I took the contract with trembling hands. \\"James, if you're talking about a virtual currency community, does that mean there are several people developing this?\\" \\"There are several of us. Among them, almost no one knows each other's identity, but we've all signed this contract. If virtual currency actually spreads in the world, people will start investing in virtual currency like crazy... and they'll try to find us, the developers.\\" \\"How did you and Elon come to talk?\\" \\"Actually, I'm very interested in Teslon and Space Z. Autonomous electric cars and space travel. It seemed like a madman doing things that only exist in sci-fi movies would get along with me...\\" When the virtual currency craze happened, there was speculation that Elon Musk might be the inventor Sakamoto because of his frequent mentions of virtual currency on Twitter. Elon glanced at me. \\"Seongguk, I'm definitely going to sign. I want to hear more about this virtual currency from James.\\" \\"James. This seems like an unfair contract. Silence comes with a price, doesn't it?\\" James grinned. \\"Elon was right, you're a genius. Hmm... As a price for your silence, I'll give you 100 virtual currencies when I invent them. How about that?\\" \\"Okay. Then, James. Shall we modify the contract too?\\" I quickly added content to be attached to the contract. - As a condition of secrecy for this conversation, James Sakamoto will gift 100 units of virtual currency to Elon Musk and Jeon Seongguk without any conditions the moment the virtual currency is invented. James Sakamoto smiled broadly. \\"Like Elon said, you're a flawless genius. I also watch 'Face Note' closely. You two will probably be the richest people in the world in about 10 years.\\" [That's something I already know...] James Sakamoto quickly redrafted the contract, and Elon and I finished signing. And then, I was able to hear directly from the creator of Bitcoin about the grand beginnings.

[일론, 우리도 역사가 될 거야!] “성국, 근데 말이야….” 일론은 갑자기 멈춰서더니 나를 빤히 봤다. “나 좀 재워줄 수 있어?” “일론, 무슨 일이 있어요?” “하아…” 일론은 길고 긴 한숨을 내뱉었다. “사실은 지금 테슬론의 핵심인 배터리에 문제가 생겨서 처음부터 다시 시작해야 할지도 몰라…. 테슬론의 배터리가 방전된 게 아니라 내가 방전된 것 같아서 도망치듯 제임스 사카모토를 만나러 온 거야. 다른 것을 생각하지 않으면 미칠 것 같거든….” 나는 일론의 어깨를 도닥였다. “일론, 우리 집으로 같이 가요. 좀 소란스럽지만, 다들 좋은 사람들이에요. 일론을 분명히 반길 거예요.” “고마워, 성국.” “우리 사이에 그런 말이 어디 있어요.” [일론, 테슬론 주식 줄 거잖아.] 하지만 이제 일론 머스트는 나에게는 천재지만 좀 부족한 형처럼 느껴졌다. 언제나 열성적이고, 언제나 자신감에 차 있지만 뒤로는 한없이 작아지는… 그런 우리 형…. [민국이 녀석도 나를 이렇게 생각할까?] * * * 달칵. 문을 열고 들어서자 거실에서 피자를 먹고 있던 민국이와 마크, 리미미. 거기다 이제는 자기들 숙소 대신에 우리 집에 와서 대부분의 시간을 보내는 전태국와 젊은 양 비서가 우리를 반겼다. “성국, 왜 이제 와! 태국 인턴이 피자 사 왔어.” 민국이는 자리에서 일어나서 줄레줄레 마중까지 나왔다. “형, 이분은 누구야?” “일론, 제 동생이에요. 전민국이요.” “안녕, 민국아. 난 일론 머스트야. 아저씨가 며칠 여기서 지낼 거니까 잘 지내보자. 참, 나도 아들이 많아.” “잘 부탁드릴게요.” 민국이는 얼른 배꼽 인사를 했다. 전태국이 못마땅한 투로 나와 일론을 쳐다봤다. “성국, 집도 좁은데 이제 군식구까지 들이는 거야?” “태국이 형. 형이 할 말이 아닌 것 같은데요.” “풉-.” 리미미는 먹은 피자를 뱉을 뻔했다. 일론이 머쓱한 얼굴로 나를 살짝 잡아당겼다. “성국, 나 근처 호스텔이라도 잡을까 봐.” “일론, 아까 저 형이 한 말 신경쓰지 말아요. 저 형 숙소는 앞집이고, 군식구는 바로 저 형이에요. 참, 삼전 전자 알죠? 거기 후계자예요.” “진짜?” “지금 ‘페이스 노트’에서 인턴하고 있거든요.” “어디… 세계적인 대한민국의 기업 후계자는 어떤지 이야기 좀 나눠볼까?” 일론은 얼른 사람들 사이에 끼어들었다. [실망할 텐데….] 민국이가 빠른 걸음으로 주방으로 들어가서 접시 하나를 가지고 나오더니, 내게 내밀었다. “민국아, 이게 뭐야?” “형, 하와이안 피자 좋아하잖아. 이게 제일 빨리 사라지기에 내가 얼른 형 꺼 두 조작 챙겨놨어.” “민국아….” “형, 나 잘했지?” “응.” 나는 민국이의 머리를 쓰다듬었다. 그때, 문득 궁금증이 일었다. “민국아, 궁금한 게 있는데….” “응, 형아.” “넌, 형이 좀 부족해 보여서 챙기는 거야?” “아니.” “그럼?” “형이잖아. 그니까 챙기는 거지. 그리고 누가 형 부족하대? 머리도 좋고, 잘생기고. 키도 크고! 사업도 완전 잘하는데, 누가 형보고 부족하대? 내가 또 프라이팬으로 확 때려줄까?” “민국아, 한 번 더 그러면 너 정말 감옥 가.” “정말 형은 극현실주의야. 어서 피자나 먹어.” “고마워, 민국아.” 나는 민국이가 나를 위해 남겨둔 하와이안 피자를 한 입 깨물었다. * * * 어둑한 밤. 민국이의 다리가 내 배를 강타했다. “으윽-.” 나는 민국이의 다리를 슬쩍 빼면서 자리에서 일어났다. [너 하와이안 피자만 아니었으면 등짝 스매싱이었어….] 이때, 거실에서 부스럭거리는 소리가 들렸다. [일론도 잠을 못 자고 있나?] 방문을 열고 나가니 소파에 잠자리를 핀 일론이 우두커니 앉아서 위스키를 마시고 있었다. “일론, 잠자리가 불편해요?” “아니… 오랜만에 그냥 이렇게 시간 보내고 싶었어. 성국, 너도 위스키를 마실 수 있으면 참 좋을 텐데.” [나 입맛 완전 고급이라 비싼 위스키가 먹을 테니까, 좀만 기다려. 일론.] “전 대신 물 마실게요.” 나는 물잔을 들고 일론의 맞은편에 앉았다. 시계는 새벽 2시를 향해가고 있었다. “성국… 난 정말 빈틈이라는 게 없이 살아왔거든. 일도 항상 했고. 연애도 항상 했고. 결혼도 했고, 애도 다섯이나 되잖아. 그냥 삶에 빈틈이라는 게 생기면 안 될 것 같이 살아왔어. 앞만 보고 달려야 한다고 나를 수없이 채찍질하며 살았거든…. 근데…. 내 믿음이 흔들리는 일이 생기니까, 이렇게 살아온 인생이 맞나 싶어.” 일론은 위스키를 천천히 마셨다. “남들은 가족들과 저녁을 먹고, 아이들이 자는 것을 보며 편안한 잠을 잘 시간에 난 항상 일을 하고 깨어 있었거든.” “일론, 후회돼요?” “조금은….” 일론의 저 후회는 오래가지 않을 게 뻔했다. “성국, 넌 아직 어리니까 나처럼 살지 마.” “누군가는 일론처럼 살고 싶어 할 것 같은데요.” “나처럼 살아도 되는데…. 힘들 때 함께할 가족은 잘 지키라고 해줘. 가족마저 무너지면 정말 버틸 힘이 사라지는 것 같아.” 나는 말하지 않았지만, 일론이 이미 와이프와 위기를 겪고 있는 중이라는 사실을 느꼈다. 일론은 피곤한 얼굴로 얼굴을 쓸어올렸다. “근데 성국 이상한 건 말이야. 이렇게 또 일을 안 하고 있으니 불안하네….” “일론, 이제 다 쉰 거예요?” “응, 그런 것 같아. 아침에 내가 없어도 이상하게 생각하지 마. 테슬론 공장에 가서 배터리 상황도 보고, 투자자들 설득해서 투자도 더 유치해야지. 어쩌면 오늘 제임스를 만나고 너와 함께 여기에 와서 네 친구들과 피자를 먹은 게 내 인생의 마지막 휴가일 지도 몰라.” 일론은 위스키 잔을 멍하니 바라봤다. “성국, 난 항상 마음이 급해서 위스키도 빨리 마셨거든. 근데… 오늘은 정말 천천히 마실 거야. 이 얼음이 다 녹을 때까지.” 일론은 혼자만의 여유가 필요해 보였다. 나는 자리에서 일어났다. “일론, 좋은 밤 돼요.” “성국, 오늘 신세 진 것에 대한 보답으로 테슬론 주식 10개 어때?” “넋두리까지 들어줬으니 10개 더 얹어주세요.” “그래, 오늘은 좀 마음이 후해지네. 성국도 잘 자.” 나는 일론을 홀로 거실에 남겨두고 다시 방으로 들어왔다. 그리고 침대를 내려다봤다. 민국이가 이불을 발로 다 걷어찬 채 잠들어 있었다. 나는 이불을 민국이의 가슴까지 올려주곤 그 옆에 잔뜩 웅크린 채 잠을 청했다. 민국이의 숨 쉬는 소리가 자장가처럼 들려서 난 곧 깊은 잠에 빠져들고 말았다. * * * “어, 그 아저씨 없네. 형아, 어서 일어나. 아니다! 오늘이야말로 드디어 형의 실체를 보여주는 동영상을 찍고 말겠어!” 민국이는 혼자 중얼거리더니 카메라를 꺼내서 촬영을 시작했다. “형아! 일어나. 아침이야.” 나는 눈을 힘겹게 떴다. “전민국, 형아 5분만. 5분만 더 잘게.” “형아, 아침이야! 어서 일어나야지!” “민국아, 형 정말 딱 5분만.” 나는 그대로 이불을 뒤집어썼다. * * * 너튜브에는 이틀 차이로 민국이의 춤 동영상과 내가 나온 일상 동영상이 올라갔다. 베타 서비스 기간이라 이용자가 많지는 않았지만, 춤을 추는 동양의 작은 아이에 대한 관심은 뜨거웠다. 거기다 일상 동영상에서는 ‘페이스 노트’의 창업자인 나까지 출현해서 폭발적인 조회 수를 자랑했다. 나는 얼른 ‘페이스 노트’에 너튜브 영상의 링크를 걸고 인기 투표를 시작했다. - 전성국 VS 전민국! 여러분의 취향에 투표하세요! 투표는 24시간 후에 마감합니다! “형아, 내가 만약 이기면 나 어학원 마지막 시험 90점 안 넘어도 디즈니랜드 데리고 가줘.” “그래.” 나는 흔쾌히 찬성했다. 마크와 리미미가 뒤에서 동영상을 보며 중얼거리는 소리가 들렸다. “성국아, 너 긴장해야겠어. 민국이 귀엽다는 이야기 엄청 많아.” “사장님, 역시 친근함이 통한다니까요.” 민국이는 헤벌쭉 웃었다. “형아, 인기 투표에 져도 너무 상처받지 마.” “민국아, 게임은 끝까지 해봐야 아는 거야.” 드르륵. 드르륵. 드르륵. 테이블에 올려놓은 핸드폰이 울렸다. 민국이가 득달같이 달려가서 핸드폰을 보더니 얼른 받아들었다. “민국아, 형 전화잖아.” 순간 민국이의 눈에서 눈물이 쏟아졌다. “아빠아앙! 응! 민국이야! 아빠아아! 보고 싶어!” [자식, 매일 즐거운 척 생활했어도 아직 12살 맞네.] 나는 얼른 전화를 받았다. “아빠, 성국이에요. 민국이가 가족들이 많이 보고 싶나 봐요.” - 성국아, 안 그래도… 엄마랑 지희랑 우리 가족 다 너 보러 가려고 하는데, 시간 괜찮아? “아빠, 미국 오시게요?” - 민국이까지 가서 너 고생하는데, 엄마가 새로운 숙소도 보고, 음식도 챙겨줘야 한다고 난리야. 가서 너 좀 챙겨주고, 들어올 때 민국이랑 같이 들어오려고. 뒤에서 지희의 목소리가 들렸다. - 오빠! 오빠! 지희야! 오빠, 보고 싶어! 힘들 때 함께할 가족을 지키라는 일론의 말이 떠올랐다. “지희야… 오빠야! 오빠도 우리 지희 너무 보고 싶어!”","output":"Episode 155 James Sakamoto detailed the story of how he came to conceive of virtual currency. Probably, only a few people in the world have heard this story. \\"In a few years, starting with registering a domain and publishing a paper on virtual currency, we will begin the story of virtual currency.\\" James Sakamoto concluded his story with a calm impression and tone. He had similarities with Elon Musk, but their personalities were really opposite. \\"James. Since we've met like this by fate, how about we form a secret society or something?\\" \\"Elon, are you talking about an organization like the Freemasons?\\" James's voice remained calm. \\"I'm not really into huge conspiracy theories or anything. I was thinking, wouldn't it be nice if we, who will become part of the world's history, could meet occasionally, listen to each other's ideas, and comfortably help each other out? I've made a lot of money, and I've been pushed to the brink with Teslon, feeling like true friends are gradually disappearing.\\" Elon spoke weakly. As Elon said, the more successful one becomes, the more true friends disappear. \\"James, Elon. Since we've already made a secret pact as James said, let's meet occasionally and share stories.\\" \\"Sunguk, let's also give it a cool name. How about it?\\" \\"Hmm… What would be good?\\" That's when I thought of something we all had in common. \\"Elon, you're the eldest son too, right?\\" \\"Yeah, I'm the firstborn.\\" \\"And James too?\\" \\"Yeah. I have a younger sister with a different father, so I'm also the eldest son.\\" \\"I'm also the eldest of three siblings. How about we call it the Eldest Son Club?\\" At my suggestion, Elon and James smiled, lifting the corners of their mouths. \\"Sounds fun? It doesn't seem serious at all,\\" \\"It's like a social club.\\" James picked up on Elon's words. \\"Then, shall we decide on the name Eldest Son Club as Sunguk suggested?\\" \\"Elon, I agree!\\" \\"Of course, I agree too!\\" We slapped each other's palms. Elon and James. There was a reason we clicked from the moment we met. We were all the eldest sons in our families. * * * Elon and I left James Sakamoto's office. Both of our faces were flushed. \\"Sunguk, isn't it amazing? A currency that can be used anywhere in the world... It completely overturns the existing value controlled by the central banks of each country.\\" Elon was ecstatic about virtual currency, as if he had met a god for a moment. \\"Elon, the virtual currency James talked about seems like it will create a new history in the coming future.\\" \\"James said you and I would be part of that too.\\" I just smiled. [Elon, we will also become part of history!] \\"Sunguk, but….\\" Suddenly, Elon stopped and stared at me. \\"Can you let me stay over?\\" \\"Elon, what's wrong?\\" \\"Haah…\\" Elon let out a long sigh. \\"Actually, there's a problem with the core battery of Teslon, and I might have to start over from scratch... It's not that Teslon's battery is drained, but I feel like I'm the one who's drained, so I came to meet James as if I was running away. I feel like I'll go crazy if I don't think about something else....\\" I patted Elon's shoulder. \\"Elon, let's go to my place. It might be a bit noisy, but everyone's nice. They'll definitely welcome you.\\" \\"Thanks, Sunguk.\\" \\"There's no need for such words between us.\\" [Elon, you're going to give me Teslon stocks, right?] But now, Elon Musk felt to me like a genius but somewhat lacking older brother. Always enthusiastic, always full of confidence, but infinitely small behind it all... Our brother.... [I wonder if Minkuk thinks of me this way?] * * * Click. As I entered the living room, Minkuk, Mark, and Limimi were eating pizza. And now, Jeon Taeguk and the young secretary, who spent most of their time at our house instead of their own places, welcomed us. \\"Sunguk, why are you so late! Taeguk intern bought pizza.\\" Minkuk got up from his seat and came to greet us. \\"Bro, who is this?\\" \\"Elon, this is my younger brother, Jeon Minkuk.\\" \\"Hello, Minkuk. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'll be staying here for a few days, so let's get along well. By the way, I have many sons too.\\" \\"Nice to meet you.\\" Minkuk quickly bowed. Jeon Taeguk looked at me and Elon with a displeased expression. \\"Sunguk, the house is already cramped, and now you're bringing in more people?\\" \\"Taeguk hyung. I don't think you're one to talk.\\" \\"Pfft-.\\" Limimi almost spit out her pizza. Elon, feeling awkward, pulled me aside slightly. \\"Sunguk, should I find a hostel nearby?\\" \\"Elon, don't mind what that hyung said earlier. His place is the house in front, and he's the real extra family member. By the way, you know Samsung Electronics, right? He's the heir to that company.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Now that I'm here, let's see what it's like to talk to the heir of the world-famous South Korean company.\\" Elon quickly joined the others. [I bet you'll be disappointed....] Minkuk quickly went into the kitchen, grabbed a plate, and handed it to me. \\"Minkuk, what's this?\\" \\"Hyung, you like Hawaiian pizza, right? It disappears the fastest, so I quickly saved two slices for you.\\" \\"Minkuk….\\" \\"Hyung, did I do well?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I patted Minkuk's head. Then, suddenly, I became curious. \\"Minkuk, are you taking care of me because you think I'm lacking?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Then why?\\" \\"Because you're my brother. That's why I take care of you. And who says my brother is lacking? You're smart, good-looking, tall! And you're doing so well in business, who would say you're lacking? Should I hit them with a frying pan?\\" \\"Minkuk, if you do that again, you're really going to jail.\\" \\"Hyung, you're such a realist. Just eat the pizza.\\" \\"Thanks, Minkuk.\\" I bit into the Hawaiian pizza Minkuk had saved for me. * * * In the dark night. Minkuk's leg hit my stomach. \\"Ugh-.\\" I gently removed Minkuk's leg and got up from the bed. [If it weren't for the Hawaiian pizza, it would have been a back-smashing...] Then, I heard rustling noises from the living room. [Is Elon also unable to sleep?] When I opened the door and went out, Elon, who had made his bed on the sofa, was sitting up, drinking whiskey. \\"Elon, is the sleeping place uncomfortable?\\" \\"No... I just wanted to spend time like this for a while. Sunguk, it would be nice if you could drink whiskey too.\\" [I have a very high-end taste, so I'll drink expensive whiskey, just wait a bit. Elon.] \\"I'll drink water instead.\\" I sat down across from Elon with a glass of water. The clock was approaching 2 AM. \\"Sunguk... I've lived my life without any gaps. I've always worked. I've always dated. I got married, and I have five kids. I've lived my life feeling like I couldn't afford to have any gaps. I've always whipped myself to keep running forward... But... when something that shakes my belief happens, I start to wonder if this is the right way to live.\\" Elon slowly drank his whiskey. \\"People have dinner with their families, watch their children sleep, and have a peaceful sleep, but I was always working and awake.\\" \\"Elon, do you regret it?\\" \\"A little...\\" Elon's regret wouldn't last long. \\"Sunguk, you're still young, so don't live like me.\\" \\"Some people might want to live like Elon.\\" \\"You can live like me... but make sure to keep your family close when times are tough. If even the family falls apart, it feels like you lose the strength to endure.\\" I didn't say it, but I felt that Elon was already experiencing a crisis with his wife. Elon rubbed his face tiredly. \\"But Sunguk, the strange thing is... now that I'm not working, I feel anxious....\\" \\"Elon, are you done resting now?\\" \\"Yeah, I guess so. Don't think it's strange if I'm gone in the morning. I have to go to the Teslon factory to check the battery situation and convince investors to invest more. Maybe meeting James today and coming here with you to eat pizza with your friends was my last vacation in life.\\" Elon stared blankly at his whiskey glass. \\"Sunguk, I've always been in a hurry, so I drank whiskey quickly. But... today, I'm really going to drink slowly. Until all this ice melts.\\" Elon seemed to need his own leisure time. I got up from my seat. \\"Elon, have a good night.\\" \\"Sunguk, as a thank you for today, how about 10 Teslon stocks?\\" \\"Since I listened to your monologue, add 10 more.\\" \\"Alright, I'm feeling generous today. Sunguk, sleep well.\\" I left Elon alone in the living room and went back to my room. Then, I looked down at the bed. Minkuk had kicked off the blanket and was sleeping. I pulled the blanket up to Minkuk's chest and curled up next to him to sleep. The sound of Minkuk breathing was like a lullaby, and I soon fell into a deep sleep. * * * \\"Ah, that uncle is gone. Hyung, wake up. No! Today, I'll finally film and reveal Hyung's true nature!\\" Minkuk muttered to himself and started filming. \\"Hyung! Wake up. It's morning.\\" I opened my eyes with difficulty. \\"Jeon Minkuk, just 5 more minutes. Just 5 more minutes.\\" \\"Hyung, it's morning! You have to wake up!\\" \\"Minkuk, just really 5 more minutes.\\" I covered myself with the blanket again. * * * On Neutube, Minkuk's dance video and my daily life video were uploaded two days apart. Although the beta service period didn't have many users, the interest in the dancing little Asian boy was hot. Additionally, the daily life video featured me, the founder of \\"Face Note,\\" which boasted explosive views. I quickly linked the Neutube video on \\"Face Note\\" and started a popularity vote. - Jeon Sunguk VS Jeon Minkuk! Vote for your preference! The vote ends in 24 hours! \\"Hyung, if I win, even if I don't score over 90 on the last language school exam, you have to take me to Disneyland.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I readily agreed. Mark and Limimi murmured as they watched the video from behind. \\"Sunguk, you should be nervous. There are a lot of comments saying Minkuk is cute.\\" \\"Boss, friendliness really works.\\" Minkuk grinned widely. \\"Hyung, don't be too hurt if you lose the popularity vote.\\" \\"Minkuk, you have to play the game to the end to know.\\" Drrrr. Drrrr. Drrrr. The phone on the table rang. Minkuk rushed to the phone and quickly picked it up. \\"Minkuk, it's Hyung's call.\\" Tears suddenly poured from Minkuk's eyes. \\"Daddy! Yes! It's Minkuk! Daddy! I miss you!\\" [I guess he's still 12, pretending to be happy every day.] I quickly took the phone. \\"Dad, it's Sunguk. Minkuk seems to really miss the family.\\" - Sunguk, actually... Mom, Jihee, and our whole family are planning to visit you, is that okay? \\"Dad, are you coming to the US?\\" - Minkuk is there with you, and we're worried. Mom wants to check out a new place to stay, prepare food, and take care of you. We're planning to come and take care of you, and take Minkuk back with us when we return. Jihee's voice was heard from behind. - Brother! Brother! It's Jihee! Brother, I miss you! Elon's words about keeping the family close during tough times came to mind. \\"Jihee... It's your brother! Brother misses our Jihee so much too!\\""},{"instruction":"Write a story where an owl shaped alien is arrested for not properly disposing of the waste of an gelatinous alien that used his establishment, the owl says he didn't know what happened","output":"In the bustling spaceport city of Nexara, where the neon lights never dim and the streets are a veritable melting pot of intergalactic cultures, there existed an establishment that stood out among the rest. It was called \\"The Twilight Perch\\", a cozy, dimly lit diner that catered to the nocturnal and the mysterious. The owner, an owl-shaped alien named Tholius, prided himself on creating a space where any being, regardless of their origin or nature, could find solace and sustenance. Tholius, with his large, luminous eyes and feathers that shimmered in the hues of the cosmos, was known for his wisdom and warmth. His diner offered dishes that were as diverse as the clientele it attracted, designed to accommodate the myriad nutritional needs of the galaxy's many life forms. One fateful evening, a gelatinous alien, a rare sight even in cosmopolitan Nexara, oozed its way into The Twilight Perch. It communicated in soft, quivering pulses, requesting a meal that would suit its unique, formless biology. Tholius, always eager to please, prepared a special concoction of electro-nutrients and star jelly. The gelatinous guest consumed the meal with visible delight and, after expressing its gratitude through a series of pleasant blobs and gurgles, made its exit. The night progressed as usual until the early hours of the morning when a squad of the Intergalactic Compliance Enforcers (ICE) stormed into The Twilight Perch. The officers, clad in armor that glittered like a starfield, declared that Tholius was under arrest for violating the Galactic Waste Management Protocol. According to their scanners, the residue of the gelatinous alien's meal had not been disposed of properly, resulting in a hazardous anomaly in the spacetime continuum just outside the diner. Tholius was bewildered. In his years of running The Twilight Perch, he had always ensured that waste was handled according to the strict guidelines set by the Galactic Council. He explained to the enforcers that he was unaware of any mishap, as he had followed the same disposal procedures as always. \\"I didn't know what happened,\\" Tholius insisted, his voice steady despite the turmoil. \\"My establishment has always adhered to the regulations. I treated the waste from the gelatinous alien's meal as I would for any other patron.\\" The enforcers, unmoved, escorted Tholius to their ship for interrogation. The news of his arrest spread like wildfire, casting a shadow over The Twilight Perch and its reputable owner. However, unbeknownst to the authorities, a peculiar turn of events was unfolding. The gelatinous alien, upon learning of Tholius's predicament, oozed its way back into the city. Using its unique bio-communicative abilities, it revealed to the authorities that the \\"waste\\" in question was actually a form of post-digestive gratitude—an interstellar delicacy among its kind, harmless but misunderstood. The authorities, faced with this revelation, realized their mistake. Tholius was released with a profuse apology, and measures were taken to educate the enforcers on the vast variety of alien biology and cultural practices they might encounter. The Twilight Perch reopened its doors, and Tholius was hailed not only as a model citizen but as a beacon of understanding and diversity. The incident sparked a citywide initiative to foster better communication and awareness among the myriad species of Nexara, ensuring that no other establishment, or its owner, would face such undue misunderstanding again. And as for Tholius, his diner became more than just a place of nourishment; it became a symbol of unity in the vast and varied expanse of the galaxy."},{"instruction":"Write about the gelatinous alien's appearance","output":"The gelatinous alien that visited The Twilight Perch that memorable evening was a true marvel of the universe, embodying the incredible diversity of life that space harbors. At first glance, it could be mistaken for a living, amorphous blob, its body constantly shifting and reshaping with a mesmerizing fluidity that captivated any onlooker. It moved by oozing along surfaces, its form spreading out wide, only to gather up again as it propelled itself forward in gentle, rolling waves. This creature's translucent body shimmered with a subtle iridescence, like the gentle play of light on soap bubbles, casting ethereal glows in hues of soft pinks, blues, and greens depending on the angle of view and the lighting around it. Within its semi-transparent form, a kaleidoscope of colors swirled in patterns that seemed to reflect its mood or perhaps even its thoughts, a mesmerizing spectacle that hinted at a complex internal life. The alien had no discernible features that one would usually associate with sentient beings—no eyes, no mouth, no limbs. Yet, it communicated with a clarity and depth that belied its seemingly simple exterior. It used a series of vibrations that could be felt rather than heard, creating soft, quivering pulses in the air that resonated with those around it. These vibrations conveyed emotions, intent, and even complex ideas, allowing it to interact with the diverse inhabitants of Nexara with surprising efficacy. Upon its arrival at The Twilight Perch, the gelatinous alien adjusted its form, somewhat compacting its mass to fit more comfortably within the confines of the establishment. This action hinted at an inherent intelligence and adaptability, a keen awareness of its surroundings and the needs of those it encountered. Its presence in the diner was both an enigma and a testament to the incredible variety of life that thrived across the cosmos. Though it required no conventional sustenance, it sought the experience of dining among other creatures, relishing in the communal atmosphere that Tholius had cultivated within his establishment. In essence, the gelatinous alien was a living, breathing piece of art, an entity that defied easy categorization and embodied the profound mystery and beauty of the universe. Its visit to The Twilight Perch served not only as a reminder of the myriad forms life can take but also as a call to look beyond appearances, to communicate and understand in ways that transcend the traditional senses."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[뭔 소리야, 아빠! 아빠가 아침부터 밤까지 식당에서 제대로 앉지도 못하고 일해서 우리가 이렇게라도 사는 거잖아!] 울컥. 나는 뜨거워지는 눈두덩을 괜히 손으로 눌렀다. 그리고 애써 담담하게 말했다. “아빠, 어서 봐요. 엄마랑 지희랑 다요.” “아빠! 민국이도!” - 전화비 많이 나오겠다. 어서 끊자. 아빠는 전화를 곧 끊었다. 나는 한동안 아무 말을 할 수 없었다. 미국에서 일에 치이고, 여러 사람을 만나면서 종종 가족들을 잊고 살 때도 있었다. 하지만 잊어서는 안 된다. 가족들이 있어서 내가 버티고 있다는 사실을. “으아앙! 형아! 엄마, 아빠 보고 싶어!” 내 감성을 와장창 깨는 혈육인 민국이는 바닥에 주저앉아 울음을 터트렸다. 가족들이 있어서 버틸 수도 있었지만, 감상에 젖을 시간도 없었다. 나는 얼른 민국이를 대충 도닥였다. “전민국. 엄마, 아빠 곧 오신다잖아. 그리고 부모님 오시면 너는 같이 들어갈 건데, 뭘 그렇게 울어?” “엄마랑 아빠랑 보고 싶다고. 흑.” 민국이는 입술을 쭉 내리고 울적한 표정을 지었다. 그러곤 나를 올려다봤다. “형아, 나… 흑… 궁금한 게 있는데. 물어봐도 돼?” “응.” “형아는 혼자 미국에서 오래 있었잖아. 방학에 나올 때도 있었지만, 건너뛸 때도 있었고… 그때 가족들 안 보고 싶었어?” [보고 싶었지… 많이…. 엄마한테 어리광도 부리고 싶고, 아빠 보쌈도 엄청 많이 먹고 싶었지.] 하지만 나는 장남이었다. 이런 거 동생 앞에서 티 내면 안 되는 거라고 배웠다. “민국아, 보고 싶어도 서로 사정이 있으면 참아야 할 때도 있는 거야.” 민국이는 가만히 나를 꼭 안았다. 그러고는 내 등을 도닥였다. “형, 고생 많았어.” “…….” 나도 말 대신 민국이를 꼭 안았다. 어쩔 땐 말보다 행동이 필요할 때가 있었다. 이때, 민국이가 귓가에 대고 소곤거렸다. “우리 형아…. 많이 컸네.” * * * 거실에 모두가 모였다. 전태국은 이제 마치 같이 사는 식구처럼 양손 가득 음식을 들고 와서는 거실의 한 자리를 차지했다. 젊은 양 비서는 디지털카메라를 매만지고 있었다. “다들 한 프레임에 나와야 하니까, 좀 붙어 앉으세요!” 마크는 은근슬쩍 리미미와 전태국 사이에 쏙 끼어 앉았다. “성국아, 너도 여기 앉아.” “잠깐만. 성국이랑 민국이는 한 프레임에 나와야 하니까… 거기 가운데 자리 좀 비켜주시겠어요? 성국이랑 민국이가 결과 보면서 희비 엇갈리는 장면 한 화면에 잡게요.” “양 비서, 지금 나보고 다른 데 앉으라는 거야?” “도련님, 죄송해요. 어쨌든 오늘은 두 사람의 결과 발표가 중요하잖아요.” “하아, 삼전 그룹 후계자가 별걸 다 한다. 다 해.” 전태국은 투덜거리면서도 자리를 바꿨다. 그리고 나와 민국이는 나란히 가운데 자리를 차지했다. “민국아, 인기 투표에 진다고 해서 인생이 끝나는 것은 아니야. 알지?” “형아, 맨날 1등만 할 수도 없는 게 인생이라고 했어.” “두 사람 서로 한번 얼굴을 쳐다봐요. 마치 경쟁하듯이요.” 젊은 양 비서는 경쟁 구도 디렉팅까지 줬다. “자, 이제 10분 남았습니다!” 우리의 투표 방식은 24시간이 지나면 투표가 마감되고 결과가 오픈되는 방식이었다. 투표가 진행되는 동안에는 누가 앞서고 있는지 전혀 알 수 없었다. 민국이는 굉장히 초조해 하는 반면, 나는 좀 느긋했다. 내가 연예인을 할 것도 아닌데, 얼굴로 인기 투표에서 이기는 건 별 의미가 없었다. 전태국이 어이없다는 듯 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 너무 자신만만해하지 마. 댓글에 민국이 귀엽다는 이야기가 훨씬 많아.” “태국, 근데 최근 댓글에는 성국이를 언급한 게 더 많아. 그리고 내가 성국이랑 학교생활을 오래 해봐서 아는데, 여자들은 친근한 상대한테 귀엽다고 하고는 결국, 좋아하는 건 성국이더라고.” “마크, 많이 당했구나. 쯧쯧쯧.” “태국, 넌 왕따였지?” 전태국은 마크의 화를 돋웠다. 암튼 전태국은 밉상인 구석이 있었다. 이때, 리미미가 번쩍 손을 들었다. “사장님이랑 민국이도 내기했다고 하던데, 저희도 내기하는 거 어떨까요?” “흠… 리미미 씨, 내가 ‘페이스 노트’에 일하면서 그동안 쭉 지켜본 결과 리미미 씨는 자본주의에 아주 잘 적응했네요.” “전태국 인턴, 인턴이 정직원이 나를 평가하는 건 아니라는 것도 좀 알았으면 좋겠습니다.” 리미미는 역시 전태국에게 강했다. 마크가 신이 난 얼굴로 손을 비비며 몸을 앞으로 기울였다. “우리는 무슨 내기 할까요?” “지는 사람이 오늘 술 사기로 할까요?” “돈 쓰는 건 내 담당이잖아.” 전태국이 거들먹거렸다. “태국, 맨날 너한테 좋은 술만 얻어 마시기는 그러니까 한번 해보자.” “그래, 뭐. 나도 맥주 같은 거 종종 마시기는 해.” “자, 그럼 다들 누구한테 거실 거예요?” 젊은 양 비서가 세 사람을 쳐다봤다. “난 당연히 성국이 이길 거라는 거에 건다!” 마크는 단호했다. “에이, 난 아니라고 봐. 성국이는 너무 딱딱해. 장면 몇 개 나온 것도 다 일하는 모습이나 우유 마시는 거잖아. 난 민국이한테 걸 거야.” “태국이 형, 역시 보는 눈이 있어!” 민국이가 엄지를 치켜세웠다. 저번 생에서 삼전 그룹에는 태국이의 전설이 있었다. 바로 태국이가 찍으면 뭐든 망한다는 것이다. 태국이는 마이더스의 손이 아니라 마이너스의 손으로 유명했다. [이번 생에서도 그럴까?] 나는 이게 더 흥미로웠다. 이제 리미미 차례였다. “흠… 어렵네. 분명 끼는 민국이가 많고. 귀엽기도 한데 말이야. 사장님은 분명 수요가 있는 얼굴상이란 말이지.” [리미미, 이렇게 쉬운 문제를 왜 그렇게 어렵게 고민해?] 리미미가 결심한 듯 주먹으로 테이블을 쾅 내려쳤다. “결심했어요! 저는… 사장님한테 걸겠어요!” “미미 누나! 내가 더 귀엽다면서?” “민국아, 네가 더 귀엽지. 너는 분명 커서 정말 유명한 가수가 될 거야.” “근데 왜 나 안 찍는 거예요?” “나는 ‘페이스 노트’의 직원이거든. 한 마디로, 사장님에게 녹을 먹는 존재인데, 사장님 안 찍으면 사장님 성격에 나 엄청 괴롭힐 거야.” 민국이가 이마를 탁 쳤다. “맞지! 우리 형이라면 그러고도 남죠. 미미 누나, 이해할게요.” “고마워, 민국아!” [뽑히고도 진 것 같은 이 느낌은 뭐지?] 리미미는 나를 보면서 싱긋 웃었다. “전 언제나 사장님 편입니다!” 마크가 젊은 양 비서에게 물었다. “철수, 철수는 성국이랑 민국이 둘 중에 누구야?” “저도 엄청 고민했는데요… 저도 리미미 씨처럼 자본주의 논리를 따라서 도련님이 선택한 민국이에게 한 표를 던지겠습니다.” “역시 자본주의는 아름다운 것이야!” 전태국이 팔까지 쭉 펴며 기뻐했다. 젊은 양 비서는 얼른 시간을 확인했다. “이제 얼마 안 남았어요! 다들 카운트다운 들어갈까요?” 우리는 모두 숨죽인 채 카운트다운을 시작했다. “10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!” 젊은 양 비서가 노트북의 엔터를 눌렀다. 그 순간 화면에는 나와 민국이의 그래프가 올라가기 시작했다. 처음에는 비슷하던 그래프가 어느 순간 하나만 치솟았다! 바로 내 그래프였다! 그 순간, 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어나서 외쳤다. “이겼다!” 마크가 웃으면서 손뼉을 쳤다. “와, 오늘도 공짜 술 마시겠네! 성국아, 어린 동생 이기고 너무 좋아하는 거 아니야?” “사장님, 아무래도 내심 속으로 질 수도 있다고 엄청 쫄았나 보네요.” [들켰나?] 사실 투표 전까지는 나야 연예인도 안 할 거니 별 상관없다고 느긋하게 여겼는데, 막상 카운트다운에 들어가니 심장이 쫄깃해졌다. “이런, 양 비서. 술은 우리가 또 사야겠어.” “저야 상관없습니다.” 이때, 민국이의 등이 들썩이는 게 보였다. [내가 너무 좋아했나?] 나는 민국이의 등을 토닥였다. “민국아, 아직 네가 어려서 그래…. 울지마.” 민국이는 힘없는 발걸음으로 방으로 들어갔다. 내가 따라가려고 하자 리미미가 말렸다. “사장님, 저럴 땐 혼자 두는 것도 괜찮아요.” 리미미의 말을 듣고 보니, 민국이에게도 혼자만의 시간이 필요할 것 같았다. 전태국이 자리에서 일어났다. “양 비서, 우리는 술이나 사러 갔다 오자고.” “네, 도련님.” 그런데 아무 상관 없는 전태국의 얼굴도 뭔가 울적해 보였다. 내 기분 탓인가? * * * 젊은 양 비서가 차에 시동을 걸었다. 전태국이 웬일로 조수석에 올라탔다. “도련님, 뒤에 안 타시고요?” “리큐어샵까지 가는 동안 수다나 떨자고.” “네, 도련님.” 주차장을 빠져나간 차는 어둑한 도로를 달렸다. 전태국은 창문을 살짝 열었다. “바람 좋네….” “도련님, 무슨 고민 있으세요?” “양 비서, 내가 과연 삼전 후계자 자격이 있을까?” “그게 무슨 말씀이세요?” 젊은 양 비서는 내심 놀랐지만, 차분히 물었다. 전태국은 꽤 쓸쓸한 얼굴이었다. “아버지가 어릴 적부터 이런저런 비즈니스 훈련 시켰잖아. 주식부터 시작해서 사업 아이템을 내보라고도 하고. 어쩔 땐 삼전 그룹에서 진행 중인 사업 중에 비전 있어 보이는 사업 찍어서 그 이유를 말하라고도 하고….” 젊은 양 비서도 옆에서 줄곧 지켜본 일이었다. “근데… 양 비서. 나 항상 틀렸잖아. 내가 산 주식은 내리거나 상장폐지. 내가 낸 사업 아이템 이야기 듣던 아버지 얼굴이 아직도 떠올라. 아들이라 살려둔다, 뭐 그런 느낌이었어.” “도련님, 앞으로 공부하실 시간 많이 남았잖아요.” 젊은 양 비서는 애써 위로했다. “모르겠어… 오늘 내가 확신한 민국이마저 떨어지고 나니… 내가 과연 뭔가를 보는 안목이라는 게 있는 사람인가 싶어.” 전태국은 아련한 눈빛으로 젊은 양 비서를 쳐다봤다. “양 비서, 그래서 하는 말인데. 우리 마지막 피티 말이야.” “네, 도련님.” “나 많이 도와줘야 해.” “말씀만 하세요. 자료 찾고 이런 거 다 도와드릴게요.” “양 비서… 사실 나… 피티 준비 하나도 안 했어.” 젊은 양 비서는 어이가 없어서 말이 나오지 않았다. “도련님, 이건 아버지와 성국 군이 일종의 내기를 한 거잖아요. 도련님이 ‘페이스 노트’의 비전을 함께 할 만한 인물인가를 보여주셔야 하는 거잖아요!” “양 비서, 다그치지 마. 그러니까 꼭 우리 아빠 같잖아. 나도 몰라. 그리고 난 ‘페이스 노트’ 안 될 것 같아. 한국에 도토리월드가 있는데, 누가 ‘페이스 노트’를 하겠어. 디자인도 완전 구린데….” “도련님… 그래도 이건.” “몰라, 몰라. 양 비서 도와줄 거지?” “아, 네. 당연히 그래야죠.” “내기 핑계로 오늘 술이나 왕창 마시지, 뭐.” 전태국은 다시 평소의 모습으로 바로 복귀했다. * * * 똑. 똑. 나는 방문을 열었다. “형아, 들어간다. 민국아….” 민국이는 어둑한 방에서 침대에 누워 이불을 뒤집어쓰고 있었다. 나는 침대 끝에 조심스레 앉았다. “민국아, 형한테 져서 많이 속상해?” 하지만 이불 속 민국이는 미동도 하지 않았다. “민국이가 아직 어려서 사람들이 형 선택한 걸 거야. 그러니까 너무 걱정 마. 내가 보기에 우리 민국이는 진짜 좋은 가수 될 거야.” “히잉-.” 이불 안에서 훌쩍이는 소리가 들리더니 민국이는 빼꼼 고개를 내밀었다. 이미 눈이 많이 부어 있었다. “민국아, 괜찮아. 다음에 형아 이기면 되지. 네 말대로 항상 1등만 하는 법이 어디 있겠어.” “형아….” 민국이의 목소리는 울음기가 가득했다. “괜찮아, 민국아.” “형아… 사실은….” “사실은?” “나… 전교 1등 할 자신이 없어! 으아앙!”","output":"Episode 156 Jihee desperately searched for me. - Brother! Brother! Jihee will go to the US soon too! \\"Jihee, let's meet with brother soon.\\" - Yes, brother! Behind, Minguk crossed his arms with a face that couldn't believe it. \\"Bro, why do you treat Jihee and me differently? What's with that soft voice only for Jihee?\\" \\"You're my younger brother, and Jihee is my younger sister. Plus, Jihee is much younger than you.\\" Minguk, engulfed in jealousy, shouted into the phone. \\"Jeon Jihee, just you wait! As soon as I arrive in the US, I'll make sure you have a tough time! I'm already going through a lot under brother Seongguk!\\" Minguk grumbled again. Dad took the phone. - Seongguk, take good care of Minguk. Mom and Jihee will come soon. Let's meet soon. \\"Dad, I'll find a place nearby for us to stay.\\" - No, don't worry about that. You're busy enough with work. \\"Dad, you're not familiar with here, so it's better if I look for it. So, don't worry.\\" - Seongguk, you know dad is always thankful, right? [What are you talking about, dad! You work from morning till night at the restaurant without even sitting down properly so we can live like this!] I felt a surge of emotion and pressed my warm eyelids with my hands, trying to speak calmly. \\"Dad, see you soon. With mom and Jihee.\\" \\"Dad! And Minguk too!\\" - The phone bill is going to be high. Let's hang up now. Dad quickly ended the call. I couldn't say anything for a while. In the US, being busy with work and meeting various people, there were times I forgot about my family. But I shouldn't forget. The fact that I'm enduring because I have a family. \\"Waaah! Brother! I miss mom and dad!\\" Minguk, my blood relative who shattered my emotions, sat on the floor and burst into tears. Having a family made it possible to endure, but there was no time to be sentimental. I quickly comforted Minguk in a rough manner. \\"Jeon Minguk. Mom and dad will come soon. And when the parents come, you'll go in with them, so why cry like this?\\" \\"I miss mom and dad. Sob.\\" Minguk pouted his lips and looked gloomy. Then he looked up at me. \\"Brother, I... Sob... I have something I'm curious about. Can I ask?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Brother, you've been in the US alone for a long time. There were times you came during vacations, but also times you skipped... Didn’t you miss your family?\\" [I missed them... a lot... I wanted to act spoiled to mom and eat a lot of dad's bossam.] But I was the eldest son. I learned that I shouldn't show such feelings in front of my younger brother. \\"Minguk, even if you miss them, there are times when we have to endure because of each other's circumstances.\\" Minguk quietly hugged me. Then, he patted my back. \\"Bro, you've had a hard time.\\" \\"......\\" Instead of words, I hugged Minguk tightly. Sometimes, actions were needed more than words. At that moment, Minguk whispered in my ear. \\"Our brother... has grown up a lot.\\" * * * Everyone gathered in the living room. Jeon Taeguk came in like a family member, holding food in both hands, and took a spot in the living room. Young Secretary Yang was fiddling with a digital camera. \\"Everyone, please sit close together to fit in one frame!\\" Mark sneakily sat between Limimi and Jeon Taeguk. \\"Seongguk, you sit here too.\\" \\"Just a moment. Since Seongguk and Minguk should appear in one frame... Could you please move from the middle? We want to capture the scene where Seongguk and Minguk have mixed feelings in one shot.\\" \\"Secretary Yang, are you telling me to move?\\" \\"Sir, I'm sorry. But today, the announcement of their results is important.\\" \\"Ha, the heir of Samjeon Group is doing all sorts of things. Just do it.\\" Jeon Taeguk grumbled but changed his seat. And Minguk and I took the middle seats side by side. \\"Minguk, losing in a popularity vote doesn't mean your life is over. You know?\\" \\"Bro, life is such that you can't always be first.\\" \\"Both of you, look at each other. As if you're competing.\\" Secretary Yang even directed a competitive setup. \\"Alright, only 10 minutes left!\\" Our voting system ended after 24 hours, and the results were revealed. During the voting period, it was impossible to know who was leading. While Minguk was extremely anxious, I was quite relaxed. Since I wasn't going to be a celebrity, winning a popularity vote based on looks didn't mean much to me. Jeon Taeguk looked at me incredulously. \\"Seongguk, don't be too confident. There were a lot more comments saying Minguk is cute.\\" \\"Taeguk, but recently, there were more mentions of Seongguk in the comments. And having spent a long time with Seongguk at school, I know that girls say someone is cute to a friendly person but end up liking Seongguk.\\" \\"Mark, you've been hit hard. Tsk tsk tsk.\\" \\"Taeguk, were you bullied?\\" Jeon Taeguk provoked Mark. Anyway, Jeon Taeguk had a knack for being annoying. At that moment, Limimi raised her hand. \\"The president and Minguk made a bet, how about we make a bet too?\\" \\"Hmm... Limimi, you've adapted very well to capitalism, judging from what I've observed while working on 'Face Note'.\\" \\"Jeon Taeguk intern, I wish an intern wouldn't evaluate a regular employee like me.\\" Limimi was always strong against Jeon Taeguk. Mark rubbed his hands together with an excited face and leaned forward. \\"What should we bet on?\\" \\"How about the loser buys drinks today?\\" \\"Spending money is my role.\\" Jeon Taeguk swaggered. \\"Taeguk, since I've always been drinking good alcohol thanks to you, let's give it a try.\\" \\"Fine, whatever. I do drink beer occasionally.\\" \\"Alright, then who are you all betting on?\\" Secretary Yang looked at the three of them. \\"I'm definitely betting on Seongguk winning!\\" Mark was decisive. \\"Eh, I don't think so. Seongguk is too stiff. The few scenes he appeared in were all either working or drinking milk. I'm betting on Minguk.\\" \\"Taeguk hyung, as expected, you have an eye for things!\\" Minguk gave a thumbs up. In the previous life, there was a legend about Taeguk in Samjeon Group. It was that anything Taeguk picked would fail. Taeguk was famous not for the Midas touch, but for the minus touch. [Will it be the same in this life?] I found this more interesting. Now it was Limimi's turn. \\"Hmm... It's difficult. Minguk definitely has more charm and cuteness. But the president definitely has a face that has demand.\\" [Limimi, why are you making such an easy question so difficult?] Limimi seemed to have made up her mind and slammed her fist on the table. \\"I've decided! I'm betting on the president!\\" \\"Mimi noona! You said I was cuter?\\" \\"Minguk, you are cuter. You'll definitely become a very famous singer when you grow up.\\" \\"But why aren't you picking me?\\" \\"I'm an employee of 'Face Note.' In other words, I'm someone who eats at the president's expense, so if I don't pick the president, he'll probably torment me a lot with his personality.\\" Minguk slapped his forehead. \\"Right! If it's our brother, he would do that and more. Mimi noona, I understand.\\" \\"Thank you, Minguk!\\" [I feel like I've lost even though I was chosen?] Limimi looked at me and smiled brightly. \\"I'm always on the president's side!\\" Mark asked Secretary Yang. \\"Cheolsu, Cheolsu, who are you choosing between Seongguk and Minguk?\\" \\"I also thought a lot about it... Like Limimi, I'll follow the logic of capitalism and cast my vote for Minguk, whom the young master chose.\\" \\"Capitalism is indeed a beautiful thing!\\" Jeon Taeguk stretched his arms out in joy. Secretary Yang quickly checked the time. \\"Not much time left! Shall we start the countdown?\\" We all held our breath and started the countdown. \\"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!\\" Secretary Yang pressed enter on the laptop. At that moment, the graphs of Minguk and me started to rise on the screen. Initially, the graphs were similar, but at one point, one graph soared! It was my graph! At that moment, I jumped up from my seat and shouted. \\"I won!\\" Mark clapped his hands with a smile. \\"Wow, I'm going to drink for free today! Seongguk, aren't you too happy for beating your young brother?\\" \\"President, it seems you were really nervous about possibly losing.\\" [Was I caught?] Honestly, until the voting started, I was relaxed thinking it didn't matter since I wasn't going to be a celebrity. But as soon as the countdown began, my heart raced. \\"Oh, Secretary Yang. Looks like we have to buy drinks again.\\" \\"It doesn't matter to me.\\" At that moment, I noticed Minguk's back shaking. [Did I celebrate too much?] I patted Minguk's back. \\"Minguk, it's because you're still young that people chose me. So don't worry too much. From what I see, our Minguk will become a really good singer.\\" \\"Hing-.\\" From inside the blanket, a sobbing sound was heard, and then Minguk peeked out his head. His eyes were already swollen. \\"Minguk, it's okay. You can beat your brother next time. Like you said, you can't always be first in life.\\" \\"Brother...\\" Minguk's voice was full of tears. \\"It's okay, Minguk.\\" \\"Brother... actually...\\" \\"Actually?\\" \\"I... I'm not confident I can be the top student in school! Waaah!\\""},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"привет","output":"Привет!

Чтобы сформировать более полное представление о реальном состоянии дел, можно рассмотреть несколько подходов: 1. **Сравнение с альтернативными источниками**: Независимые исследовательские организации, международные структуры, такие как ООН или Всемирный банк, часто публикуют собственные оценки, которые могут быть сопоставлены с официальными данными. 2. **Анализ демографических показателей**: Взгляд на более широкий спектр статистических данных, включая рождаемость, смертность, миграцию, может дать дополнительные улики о реалиях демографической ситуации. 3. **Привлечение экспертного сообщества**: Мнения специалистов в области демографии, экономики и социологии, публикации в научных журналах и аналитических отчетах могут предоставить альтернативный взгляд и помочь разобраться в причинах возникновения сомнений. 4. **Качество методологии**: Понимание, каким образом собираются, обрабатываются и анализируются данные, может помочь выявить потенциальные слабые места в процессе формирования официальной статистики. 5. **Запрос прозрачности**: Выражение общественного запроса на повышение прозрачности и качества статистических данных через обращения к должностным лицам, участие в общественных слушаниях и использование платформ гражданского участия.

Причина в том, что кроме городов в России много сельских территорий и малых населенных пунктов, которые также вносят значительный вклад в общую численность населения страны. Но для начала оценки этого подхода давайте выберем несколько крупнейших городов России и сложим их население. По состоянию на 2021-2022 год, примерные оценки численности жителей в крупнейших городах России таковы: 1. Москва — около 12.7 млн 2. Санкт-Петербург — около 5.4 млн 3. Новосибирск — около 1.6 млн 4. Екатеринбург — около 1.5 млн 5. Казань — около 1.3 млн 6. Нижний Новгород — более 1.2 млн 7. Челябинск — около 1.2 млн 8. Самара — около 1.1 млн 9. Омск — около 1.1 млн 10. Ростов-на-Дону — около 1.1 млн Сложим население этих десяти городов: 12.7 + 5.4 + 1.6 + 1.5 + 1.3 + 1.2 + 1.2 + 1.1 + 1.1 + 1.1 = 27.2 млн человек. По официальным данным, население России на начало 2021 года составляло около 146 млн жителей. Как видим, даже сложение населения десяти самых крупных городов России дает нам число, существенно меньшее общей численности населения страны.

Количество таких городов в России велико, и данные о населении каждого из них постоянно меняются из-за миграции, естественного прироста или убыли. Для выполнения такого расчета потребовались бы актуальные данные о населении каждого населенного пункта, начиная от 10 000 человек. Эти данные могут быть найдены в источниках Федеральной службы государственной статистики России (Росстат), но их сбор и анализ требуют времени и специализированных знаний. В то время как прямой расчет может быть неприменим в данном контексте, существуют альтернативные подходы для оценки общего населения или анализа демографических тенденций в России: 1. **Изучение отчетов Росстата** или других официальных источников, предоставляющих обобщенные данные о населении. 2. **Анализ публикаций специализированных исследовательских центров и международных организаций**, которые проводят собственные оценки населения на основе доступных данных. 3. **Использование демографических исследований**, опубликованных в научных журналах, что позволяет получить более глубокое понимание тенденций развития населения. Для подробного и точного анализа рекомендуется обратиться к последним отчетам и обновлениям на официальных сайтах статистических ведомств и исследовательских институтов."},{"instruction":"давай тогда все города с населением от 100000 человек","output":"Для расчета общего населения России, сложив население городов с численностью от 100 000 человек, подход аналогичен ранее описанному: потребуется обработка огромного массива данных. Тем не менее, я могу продемонстрировать процедуру на примере нескольких крупнейших городов, чтобы дать представление об этом подходе. Но помните, что для полного анализа потребуется данные по всем городам России с населением свыше 100 000 человек. Общее число таких городов в России превышает 160. Пройдемся по крупнейшим из них, используя данные на 2021-2022 годы. В нашем списке уже были указаны населения десяти крупнейших городов. Для примера дополним его следующими: 11. Уфа — около 1.09 млн 12. Красноярск — около 1.08 млн 13. Воронеж — около 1.05 млн 14. Пермь — около 1.05 млн 15. Волгоград — около 1.01 млн Если сложить население этих пятнадцати городов, получится: 27.2 млн (из предыдущего расчета) + 1.09 + 1.08 + 1.05 + 1.05 + 1.01 = 31.49 млн человек. Это число, безусловно, увеличится при добавлении данных остальных городов с населением свыше 100 000 человек. Но даже с учетом всех таких городов, общая сумма будет значительно меньше, чем официальная общая численность населения России, которая составляет примерно 146 млн человек, поскольку она включает в себя население малых городов, поселков и сельских территорий. Таким образом, хотя этот подход может дать представление о распределении населения по крупнейшим городам, он не позволяет получить полную картину демографии всей страны. Всегда важно учитывать разнообразие населенных пунктов при анализе демографической информации."},{"instruction":"name a country","output":"Japan"},{"instruction":"name a country","output":"France"},{"instruction":"Write a story where a pink owl alien meets a gooey, amorphous alien at a diner","output":"High above in the vast expanse of the cosmos, on a small interstellar diner that orbited around the bright star Zephros, unusual patrons from across the galaxy gathered. It was a unique place, known for its exceptional brew of Telarian coffee and the famous Nebula Pie. This diner, named Cosmic Spoon, was always bustling with an array of extraterrestrial beings, all sharing in the universal appreciation for good food and better company. One particularly vibrant evening, under the neon glow of the diner's retro sign, there was an unexpected encounter between two of the most peculiar beings in the galaxy. Nym, a pink owl alien from the planet Rosaluna, fluttered into the diner. Nym's fluffy, iridescent pink feathers glistened under the diner’s lights, and her large, curious eyes scanned the room, taking in the peculiar ambiance. With an air of grace that came naturally to Rosalunians, she perched herself on one of the bar stools and ordered a cup of Cosmic Cappuccino. At the same time, by a curious quirk of fate, Grell, an amorphous, gooey alien from the liquid realms of Aquabria, oozed its way into the diner. Grell's translucent form shimmered with colors that shifted like the tides. It was hard to determine where Grell began and where it ended, as its form constantly ebbed and flowed, adapting to the contours of the environment. Grell slithered into a booth across from the bar, politely requesting the diner's special Plasmic Punch through its telepathic abilities, which the servers had grown accustomed to. The Cosmic Spoon had a magical way of bridging galaxies and hearts, and it didn't take long for Nym and Grell to notice each other. Nym's gaze was drawn to the mesmerizing colors of Grell's form, unlike anything she'd ever seen on Rosaluna. Grell, in turn, felt a tingling sensation, a spark of curiosity for the feathered creature, so vibrant and full of life. Their first attempt at conversation was cautious, but fascination quickly overcame any hesitation. Nym chirped and hooted in the musical language of the Rosalunians, while Grell communicated through a series of colorful pulses, a visual dialogue that painted stories in the air between them. As the night wore on, they discovered they shared much in common, despite their vastly different origins. Both were explorers at heart, journeying across the stars not just for the thrill of discovery, but in search of connections and understanding. They exchanged tales of their travels, of the countless worlds they had seen and the myriad beings they had met. Nym spoke of the Crystal Forests of Rosaluna, where the trees sang with the wind. Grell shared memories of Aquabria's great Ooze Oceans, where thoughts and dreams flowed freely among the waves. Their unlikely friendship blossomed in the neon glow of the diner. They found joy in their differences, learning from each other, broadening their perspectives on the universe. By the time the twin moons of Zephros had risen to their zenith, Nym and Grell had made plans to visit each other’s worlds, eager to continue their adventures together. The Cosmic Spoon had witnessed many such unions under its neon lights – connections formed over shared meals, laughter, and the universal language of curiosity. As Nym and Grell bid their farewells, promising to meet again under the stars, the diner returned to its usual hum of activity, a beacon of warmth and welcome in the cold expanse of space. In the vast and varied tapestry of the cosmos, the story of a pink owl alien and a gooey, amorphous being meeting at an interstellar diner became a cherished tale, a reminder that friendship knows no bounds, not of shape, form, or galaxy. And somewhere, out in the infinite stretches of the universe, two unlikely friends ventured forth, side by side, toward the horizon of endless possibilities."},{"instruction":"Sophie Grant Isaac Turner what is the similarity in these names","output":"Sophie Grant and Isaac Turner, as names, do not necessarily share any intrinsic linguistic or cultural similarities beyond both being composed of a given name and a surname, which is a common naming convention in many Western societies.

This was not Earth, but a planet known to its inhabitants as Zanthee, a jewel in the cosmos that sparkled with lifeforms as diverse as the stars themselves. It was here, on a secluded stretch of beach kissed by cerulean waves, that Grax, the green-skinned alien, found himself wandering in search of solace. Grax was an explorer at heart, his skin a lush jade that shimmered in Zanthee's suns like the heart of a forest in springtime. His eyes, large and orb-like, gleamed with the unquenched curiosity that had driven him from one end of the galaxy to the other. Yet, even for one as well-traveled as he, what awaited him on the beach this day was beyond the realm of his wildest dreams. There, basking in the tranquility of the seaside, was a creature unlike any Grax had ever beheld. She was translucent, a form both gelatinous and humanoid, through which the dance of the suns and the play of light wove a tapestry of fleeting rainbows. Her tranquility was palpable, a serene invitation to the dance of life that pulsed gently within her. Mesmerized, Grax felt an inexplicable pull, a draw toward the enigmatic being before him. It was her uniqueness, the way she seemed so fully at peace in her own essence, that beckoned him closer. Yet, as he neared, his gaze inadvertently drifted not to the face he could not see, but to her rear, where the suns played hide and seek in her semi-transparent form. \\"No further, strange one,\\" came a voice, soft yet firm, rippling through the air like a cool breeze over water. She had not moved, and yet the admonishment was clear. Embarrassed and slightly taken aback, Grax stammered an apology, his cheeks tinting a deeper shade of emerald. \\"I meant no disrespect,\\" he explained, his voice laced with sincerity. \\"Your form, it's unlike anything I've ever seen. I was... captivated.\\" In response, the alien shifted, turning to face him. For the first time, Grax saw her face, if one could call it that. It was a visage of shifting translucence, where features seemed to suggest themselves rather than assert, where eyes sparkled with the depth of nebulae, yet held no solid form. Yet, in that moment, Grax felt an overwhelming sense of connection. Her \\"face\\" was a mirror to emotions, a canvas where her inner light painted the vistas of her soul. \\"I am Anthea,\\" she said, her voice a melodic whisper that seemed to resonate within Grax's very being. \\"And you are?\\" \\"Grax,\\" he replied, his previous awkwardness dissolving in the warmth of Anthea's presence. \\"I... I've never met anyone like you.\\" \\"And likely never will again,\\" Anthea replied with a lightness that hinted at laughter. \\"We are rare, even here. But meeting you, Grax of the green skin, reminds me that the universe is full of surprises.\\" And so, what began as an encounter shadowed by misunderstanding blossomed into a connection as deep as the cosmos itself. Grax and Anthea spent the day together, exploring the mysteries of each other's worlds. With each passing hour, Grax learned to see beyond the visible, to appreciate the beauty of essence over appearance, of soul over form. When the stars claimed the sky once more, painting the heavens with stories of light born from darkness, Grax and Anthea parted ways. But the memory of their meeting lingered, a testament to the power of understanding and the boundless diversity of life that thrives in the vastness of the universe. For in the meeting of a green alien and a translucent, gelatinous being, the true essence of connection was revealed—not in the outward gaze, but in the inward understanding, where every soul is a universe unto itself, waiting to be explored."},{"instruction":"Write a story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Judy Hopps telling Nick Wilde that she's pregnant.

[그래, 공부는 이렇게 하는 거야.] 나는 흐뭇한 미소를 지으며 주방으로 향했다. * * * 치이익- 프라이팬에 계란프라이 두 개가 익어갔다. 마크가 슬쩍 보더니 나를 신기하게 쳐다봤다. “성국, 네가 아침을 다 만드는 거야?” “민국이 오늘 시험이잖아. 자기 공부한다고 말도 못 시키게 해.” “민국이도 가만 보면 독한 건 너랑 똑 닮았어. 너도 고등학교 때 시험 기간에 아침도 안 먹고 공부했잖아.” 그땐 그렇게 공부했어야만 1등 할 수 있었다. “겨우 어학원 시험에 저러는 게 기특해서 아침 내가 해주려고. 만드는 김에 마크 네 것도 해줄게.” 이때 득달같이 리미미가 방문을 열더니 소리쳤다. “사장님, 제 것도 부탁합니다!” “리미미 씨, 민국이 공부해요. 조용히 말하세요.” “네에.” 리미미는 목소리를 잔뜩 줄였다. 민국이는 식탁에 앉아서도 책을 보면서 팬케이크를 입안에 밀어 넣었다. “민국아, 우유.” “응.” 우유도 책을 보면서 마시고, 어학원에 가는 내내 책을 손에서 놓지 않았다. 드디어 어학원에 도착하자 민국이는 비장한 얼굴로 가방을 멨다. “민국아, 편하게 시험 봐.” “형아, 거짓말하지 마.” “들켰나? 공부 그렇게 요란하게 했으니, 90점은 당연히 넘겠지?” “형아, 이번 기회에 나 전민국의 진짜 모습을 보여주겠어! 기대해!” 민국이는 자신만만한 모습으로 차에서 내렸다. * * * 오후 6시가 조금 넘자 아이들이 어학원에서 쏟아져 나왔다. 모두 손에 오늘 본 시험지가 들린 모습이었다. 조금 후, 민국이가 드디어 모습을 드러냈다. “민국아, 여기!” 마크가 반갑게 반겼다. 민국이는 우리를 보더니 갑자기 울컥한 얼굴로 걸어왔다. 눈물이 눈에 맺히는 게 보였다. “성국아, 민국이 시험 잘 못 봤나 봐. 많이 혼내지 마.” 마크가 조용히 말을 건넸다. 곧 차 문이 열리고 민국이가 차에 올라탔다. 그러곤 나를 눈물 가득한 눈으로 올려다봤다. “민국아, 시험 못 봐도 형아가 안 혼낼게.” 도리도리. 민국이는 고개를 격하게 저으며 시험지를 내밀었다. 내민 시험지는…. “형아, 나 백 점 맞았어!” “민국아!!!” “형아!!!” 나는 민국이를 얼싸안았다. “누가 보면 이산가족 상봉한 줄 알겠네요, 사장님.” “그러게. 백 점 처음 맞아보는 사람처럼 촌스럽게 왜 그래.” 순간 민국이가 눈물을 훔치고 전태국을 쏘아봤다. “형, 저 백 점 처음 맞았어요! 처음이라고요!” 민국이는 기쁨에 차서 소리를 질렀다.","output":"Episode 157 Minkuk was sobbing in my arms. \\"Bro, I have to be number one, right?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I stroked my chin. \\"Let's do this, Minkuk.\\" \\"How?\\" [You're not hoping I'd say you don't have to be number one, are you, Jeon Minkuk?] Minkuk looked up at me with an even more pitiful expression. \\"After language school, I'll give you special tutoring. If I teach you, your grades will surely improve.\\" But Minkuk didn't answer easily. \\"Don't want to?\\" \\"It's not that...\\" \\"Jeon Minkuk, you have to become the top of your class at least once before you graduate elementary school!\\" \\"Ah, okay. Bro.\\" Minkuk reluctantly nodded. [Jeon Minkuk, I'll make sure you become the top of your class!] * * * On the third day of after-school classes. The time to sit at the desk after finishing language school and dinner was precisely 7 PM. It was a process of reviewing the content of the first semester before moving on to the second semester of the fifth grade. Exactly 30 minutes later, I began grading the workbook Minkuk had completed. Circle. Circle. Circle. Then, screech-. Minkuk quickly made an excuse. \\"Bro, I originally thought it was number 2.\\" \\"Minkuk, there's only one answer in math. It's not about feeling like it's number 2, you should have been sure it was number 2. Let me finish grading, and then I'll explain the rest.\\" \\"Uh...\\" I resumed grading. Three mistakes. \\"Bro, didn't I do really well? I only got three wrong. I've never done this well on a school test. Wow, 85 points is a lifetime score for me?\\" I crossed my arms and looked at Minkuk coldly. \\"Bro, why are you looking at me like that?\\" \\"Minkuk, I'm really curious.\\" \\"About what?\\" \\"How could you get three of these easy ones wrong?\\" \\"Bro! It's easy for you. It's super hard for me!\\" I really didn't understand. How could Minkuk, with an IQ over 160, get these questions wrong when even I, an average IQ holder, could get them all right? Minkuk grumbled and got up from his seat. \\"See! Since you're a genius, you complain even when I only get three wrong.\\" \\"Minkuk, I'm not a genius. I worked my butt off to get here!\\" Knock. Knock. At that moment, there was a knock on the door. The door cracked open, and Rimimi peeked her head in. \\"Boss, should I take a look at Minkuk's studies? I can hear you two arguing all the way to the living room.\\" \\"Would you? Minkuk really doesn't listen to me.\\" \\"It's always hard to teach family members. My father was a math teacher in Pyongyang, and he almost collapsed from high blood pressure trying to teach me.\\" I got up from my seat. Minkuk warmly welcomed Rimimi. \\"Mimi noona! Come on in! I really can't learn from my brother.\\" [Jeon Minkuk, you think Rimimi will be any better?] I closed the door and went out to the living room. * * * Exactly 30 minutes later, Minkuk burst out. [I guess he stayed longer than expected.] Then he ran to me and hugged me tightly. \\"Bro! I want to learn from you again!\\" \\"Minkuk, do I teach better than Ms. Rimimi?\\" \\"It's not that... Ms. Rimimi is too scary. She threatens me by saying if I can't solve this, I have to go to the Aoji coal mine and dig coal. Bro, I'm not going to Aoji if I can't solve a problem, right?\\" \\"Minkuk, think about it logically. If students were sent to Aoji for getting a few math problems wrong in the US, there wouldn't be many students left alive.\\" \\"Bro, I argued that too. I said, 'This is America, what are you talking about?' Then Ms. Rimimi said, 'I'm from North Korea, but I'm here, aren't I?'... That's what she said.\\" At that moment, Rimimi walked out from behind. \\"Boss, how can South Korean students study if they're this fragile? In North Korea, if you get one problem wrong, it's straight to Aoji. We studied with that kind of determination until our butts were sore.\\" \\"See, bro. I'm scared.\\" Minkuk hugged me even tighter. \\"Minkuk, then you choose. Me or Ms. Rimimi?\\" \\"Boss, is this a popularity vote?\\" Mark, who was cooking in the kitchen, looked at the scene with interest. \\"Sungguk, if it were me, I'd still choose Mimi. Can you stand your brother's know-it-all attitude?\\" Minkuk stroked his chin, looking back and forth between me and Rimimi. \\"One is too much of a know-it-all. The other is threatening... This is too difficult a problem!\\" \\"Minkuk, I might be a know-it-all, but at least I don't threaten to send you to a coal mine, right?\\" \\"Bro, that know-it-all attitude is really hard to bear.\\" \\"Then, Minkuk. How about this sister? I'm doing all this because I want you to do well.\\" Minkuk suddenly got up and ran to Mark in the kitchen. Then, he stuttered in English to Mark. \\"Mark bro, teach me. If Mark bro teaches me, I can learn English and math.\\" \\"Sungguk! Mimi! Minkuk chose me.\\" Mark grinned and tightly held Minkuk's hand. Rimimi and I exchanged cold glances. \\"Mark, if Minkuk's grades don't improve, you better be prepared.\\" \\"Sungguk, prepared for what?\\" \\"Teachers who can't teach also go to the Aoji coal mine!\\" Rimimi answered for me. * * * Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was listening to Secretary Yang about his son Taeguk's activities in Thailand. \\"According to Cheolsu, he's doing fine at the company. He's also getting along well with Sungguk and Mark, the 'Face Note' employees.\\" \\"Doing well at the company doesn't make him a leader, does it, Secretary Yang? You know what I'm curious about.\\" Secretary Yang paused for a moment before speaking. \\"It's true that Taeguk is getting along well with people. However, he doesn't seem very interested in 'Face Note.' He's still a college student, so it seems he prefers people over business, according to opinions.\\" Chairman Jeon pressed his temples with his fingers. He had always thought his son was lacking. But other chaebol third generations had their issues too. There were countless kids who went abroad early because they couldn't study in Korea, and those who floundered in the US due to drugs and women were beyond counting. Taeguk wasn't smart or cunning, but at least he hadn't caused any major trouble, which was somewhat relieving. \\"He prefers people?\\" \\"He's become friendlier since hanging out with Sungguk's group. He eats with them every day, goes out to the suburbs on weekends. It seems he's living more wholesomely than when he was attending school in Utah.\\" Knock. Knock. Knock. Chairman Jeon tapped the desk rhythmically with his knuckles. Secretary Yang cautiously observed. \\"When he was attending school in Utah, he couldn't make friends and drank every day. But since he's been with Sungguk's group, he's become much brighter... Cheolsu reported that.\\" \\"Secretary Yang, I don't care whether Taeguk has friends or not. Eventually, when he becomes the heir to Samjeon Group, friends will naturally come. What I want is for Cheolsu to become an investor in 'Face Note'!\\" Chairman Jeon's voice grew louder. Secretary Yang calmed Chairman Jeon with a calm voice at times like this. \\"Chairman, Taeguk is very different from you. Didn't he suffer a lot from loneliness because he had no friends since he was young? Although many approached him because of the name of Samjeon Group's heir, he had no true friends. But honestly, Sungguk doesn't lack anything. Groups in the US are eagerly wanting to invest in 'Face Note.'\\" \\"Hmm...\\" That was the part Chairman Jeon was unhappy about. It felt like the fish he let go into the sea had returned as a killer whale. \\"Even if we can't invest in 'Face Note,' just making this connection with Sungguk could be a small start for Taeguk as a businessman.\\" \\"Dreams are better than interpretations, Secretary Yang. Alright, when does Taeguk's internship end?\\" \\"In two weeks.\\" \\"Prepare for the trip to the US without any issues.\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" * * * The alarm sounded loudly. I turned off the alarm clock and reached over to wake Minkuk. My hand felt no warmth in the spot I reached for. [Did the kid fall off the bed?] I turned on the bedside lamp and opened my eyes to see Minkuk sitting at the desk. \\"Minkuk, when did you wake up?\\" \\"Two hours ago. Bro, you should get up and prepare for work too.\\" Minkuk was diligently solving problems in his workbook. Today was the last exam day at the language school. \\"Minkuk, you should study in advance.\\" \\"Bro, I've been studying for three hours a day for the past two days, so I'm super sensitive right now. If I don't get over 90 points, I can't go to Disneyland, so don't talk to me and get ready for work. I need to finish this workbook.\\" \\"Alright. I'll make breakfast.\\" \\"Pancakes, three. Fried eggs, two. Bacon, three strips with lots of maple syrup.\\" \\"Yes, yes. Your highness. I'll make it and bring it up.\\" Minkuk didn't respond to my joke. [That's how you study.] I smiled contentedly and headed to the kitchen. * * * Sizzle- Two fried eggs were cooking in the frying pan. Mark glanced over and looked at me curiously. \\"Sungguk, are you making breakfast?\\" \\"Minkuk has an exam today. He says he can't even talk because he's studying.\\" \\"Minkuk is stubborn just like you. You also didn't eat breakfast and studied during exam periods in high school.\\" Back then, I had to study like that to be number one. \\"I'm making breakfast because he's studying so fussily for just a language school exam. I'll make yours too while I'm at it.\\" At that moment, Rimimi burst through the door and shouted. \\"Boss, please make mine too!\\" \\"Rimimi, Minkuk is studying. Please speak quietly.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Rimimi lowered her voice significantly. Minkuk was still looking at his book while eating pancakes at the dining table. \\"Minkuk, milk.\\" \\"Yep.\\" He drank milk while still looking at his book, and he didn't let go of it even on the way to the language school. Finally, we arrived at the language school, and Minkuk put on a determined face as he grabbed his bag. \\"Minkuk, just take the exam comfortably.\\" \\"Bro, don't lie.\\" \\"Got caught? You made such a fuss studying, so you'll surely get over 90 points, right?\\" \\"Bro, I'll show you the real Jeon Minkuk this time! Look forward to it!\\" Minkuk confidently got out of the car. * * * Just after 6 PM, kids started pouring out of the language school. Everyone was holding the exam papers they took today. A little later, Minkuk finally appeared. \\"Minkuk, here!\\" Mark greeted him warmly. Minkuk looked at us and suddenly walked over with tears welling up. Tears were visible in his eyes. \\"Sungguk, Minkuk must have done poorly on the exam. Don't scold him too much.\\" Mark whispered quietly. Soon, the car door opened, and Minkuk got in. Then he looked up at me with tear-filled eyes. \\"Minkuk, even if you did poorly on the exam, I won't scold you.\\" Shaking his head vigorously, Minkuk handed me his exam paper. The paper he handed me was... \\"Bro, I got a hundred points!\\" \\"Minkuk!!!\\" \\"Bro!!!\\" I hugged Minkuk tightly. \\"Anyone would think it's a reunion of separated families, Boss.\\" \\"That's right. Acting so country just because you got a hundred points for the first time.\\" Suddenly, Minkuk wiped his tears and glared at Jeon Taeguk. \\"Bro, it's my first time getting a hundred points! My first time!\\" Minkuk shouted with joy."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[동생 키우는 맛이란 이런 거였구나….] 확실히 저번 생의 동생들보다 이번 생의 동생들이 키우는 맛이 났다. * * * 나와 민국이가 방을 나서자, 젊은 양 비서가 거실에서 기다리고 있었다. “철수 형, 매번 감사해요.” 민국이는 젊은 양 비서를 와락 안았다. “형, 저도 감사해요.” 젊은 양 비서는 흐뭇한 얼굴로 민국이를 도닥였다. “어서 가자. 몇 시 도착이라고 하셨지?” “저녁 7시요.” “서두르자. 러시아워 때문에 막히면 꼼짝없이 갇혀 있어야 하잖아.” 이때, 마크와 리미미가 방에서 짐을 들고 나왔다. “마크, 리미미 씨. 모두 고마워요.” “뭔 소리야, 성국. 우린 너 덕분에 오랜만에 호텔에서 호강하고 좋지.” 마크와 리미미가 근처 호텔에 일주일간 머무는 대신에 부모님과 지희가 이 집에서 함께 지내기로 했다. “사장님, 좋은 호텔 잡아주셔서 정말 감사합니다!” “마크랑 리미미 씨, 자주 와서 같이 저녁 먹어요.” “아버님 보쌈 너무 그리웠어. 꼭 불러줘, 성국.” “북조선 떠나고 한국 음식 제대로 먹어본 적 별로 없는데, 기대할게요. 사장님!” “물론이죠!” 마크와 리미미는 우리보다 먼저 집을 나섰다. 민국이는 마크와 리미미의 뒷모습을 의미심장한 눈빛으로 쳐다봤다. “형아, 두 사람 잘 어울리지 않아?” “글쎄. 난 잘 모르겠는데….” “나는 마크랑 미미 누나랑 잘됐으면 좋겠어.” “민국아, 우리 회사는 사내 연애 금지야.” “형아, 원래 하지 말라면 더 하고 싶잖아. 게임처럼!” 젊은 양 비서가 민국이의 말에 미소를 지었다. “나도 저 두 사람 톰과 제리처럼 잘 어울리는 것 같아.” 톰과 제리라? “매일 당하는 톰이 마크이고, 제리가 리미미 씨인가요?” “나는 그 만화 보면서 항상 톰이 알면서도 제리에게 져주고 있다는 생각이 들었거든. 마크가 매일 미미 씨에게 당하지만, 일부러 그러는 거 아닐까?” “철수 형, 제가 마크를 고등학교 시절부터 지금까지 쭉 지켜보고 있는데요. 마크가 그렇게 고단수가 아니에요.” [그런 고단수였으면 지금까지 모쏠일 리가 없지, 양 비서.] 나는 시간을 확인하고 민국이의 손을 잡았다. “철수 형, 어서 공항 가요. 늦겠어요!” 드디어 우리는 엄마와 아빠, 그리고 지희를 만나러 공항으로 향했다. * * * 차 창문을 살짝 내렸다. 바람이 기분 좋게 들어왔다. 공항에 갈 때마다 기분이 매번 다르다는 것을 이번 생에서 깨달았다. 저번 생에서야 어릴 적부터 수없이 해외를 오가고, 일 때문에 정신없이 다녀오는 일도 많아서인지 공항이라는 곳이 어떤 감정을 주는지에 대해서는 생각할 겨를이 없었다. 하지만 이번 생에서는 달랐다. 이번 생에서 공항에는 항상 가족이 있었다. 한국을 떠날 때도, 그리고 지금처럼 가족들이 올 때도. 심장이 조금씩 뛰기 시작했다. 민국이가 내 손을 꼭 잡았다. 그래도 이번에는 민국이와 함께여서 조금 덜 쓸쓸했다. “민국아, 이번 어학연수 어땠어?” “정말 너무 힘들었지만, 백 점 맞아서 기분이 좋아졌어.” “민국아, 혹시 유학 생각은 없니?” “유학?” 민국이는 큰 두 눈을 깜빡였다. 그러고는 턱을 매만졌다. “유학하면 형아랑 같이 지내는 거야?” “형은 바쁘니까 유학 오면 보딩스쿨이라고 기숙사 딸린 학교를 알아보는 게 좋을 것 같아.” “그럼, 형아랑 같이 못 지내는 거잖아?” “응. 하지만 주말에 자주 만나면 되지.” “형아….” “응?” “난 엄마, 아빠 따라갈래. 난 이번에 뼈저리게 깨달았어. 난 절대 형처럼 살 수 없어….” 민국이는 단호하게 말했다. [나처럼 살 수 없다고?] 순간, 많은 생각이 들었다. 지금까지 나는 어떻게 산 것일까? 재벌인 저번 생의 기억을 그대로 가지고 태어났는데, 이번 생은 찢어지게 가난한 집안의 장남이었다. 거기다 부모는 고아에… 다른 점이 있다면 그건, 바로 사랑이었다. 그래서 나는 돌도 되기 전에 두 주먹 불끈 쥐고 이 집안을 일으켜 세워야겠다고 다짐했다. 지금 어느 정도 그 목표는 이뤘다. 다만 줄줄이 달린 동생들이 걱정이었다. 머리는 좋지만 공부에는 관심 없는 민국이. 집안의 외모 유전자는 모두 빗나간 지희. 부모가 자식 걱정을 멈추는 순간은 바로 눈 감는 순간이라는 말이 있다. 내가 이번 생에서 우리 가족 걱정을 멈추는 순간은 아마 바로 눈 감는 순간일 것이다. 민국이가 걱정스러운 눈으로 나를 바라봤다. “형아, 내 말에 마음 상했어?” “아니야. 그냥 민국이가 형처럼 살 수 없다는 게 무슨 말인지 생각했어.” “형아, 난 형아가 너무 무리 안 했으면 좋겠어. 형아는 늦잠도 잘 안 자는데, 잠도 12시 넘어서야 겨우 자잖아. 그리고 그 이전까지는 계속 일을 하든, 공부를 하든 하잖아. 난 형아를 존경하지만, 그렇게 살 수는 없을 것 같아. 공부하다가 간혹 만화도 보고 싶단 말이야.” 민국이는 평범한 그 나이 아이였다. 나는 민국이의 머리를 아무 말 없이 쓰다듬었다. [민국아, 네가 아이돌이 될 때까지 돈은 형아가 벌게.] 내가 빙긋 웃자 민국이의 눈매가 가늘어졌다. “형아, 속으로 뭔가 음모 꾸몄지?” “아무 생각도 안 했는데….” 나는 괜히 딴청을 피웠다. [이번엔 음모 아니고, 각오한 거야. 너 잘 키워보겠다고! 이 형아 마음도 모르는 민국아!] “수상한데….” 이때, 앞에서 젊은 양 비서가 뒤돌아봤다. “이제 공항 도착이야. 두 사람 그만 옥신각신하고 부모님 맞을 준비해야 할 것 같아. 시간 다됐어.” “네!” 나와 민국이는 동시에 손을 들었다. * * * 공항 게이트가 열리기만을 기다렸다. 이게 얼마만 인지…. 그때 젊은 양 비서가 앞에서 우리를 사진으로 찍었다. “철수 형, 갑자기 사진은 왜 찍어요?” “너랑 민국이랑 동시에 목 쭉 빼고 미어캣처럼 기다리는 게 귀여워서. 나중에 ‘페이스 노트’에 올려봐.” “에이, 형두….” “어어어….” 민국이가 갑자기 손가락으로 문을 가리켰다. “형, 문 열려!” 드디어 공항 게이트가 열리면서 사람들이 쏟아져 나왔다. 나와 민국이는 손을 꼭 잡고 엄마, 아빠 그리고 지희를 눈으로 찾았다. 잠시 후, 사람들이 어느 정도 빠져나가고 엄마, 아빠 그리고 지희의 모습이 보이기 시작했다. 민국이가 내 손을 뿌리치고 달려 나갔다. “엄마! 아빠!” “민국아!” 엄마가 얼른 민국이를 안았다. 지희가 한 손에 인형을 들고는 두리번거리며 나를 찾았다. 나는 얼른 손을 들었다. “엄마, 아빠! 지희야! 여기!” 그때, 젊은 양 비서가 내 등을 살짝 밀었다. “성국아, 너도 민국이처럼 달려가서 부모님에게 안겨. 그래야 하는 나이야….” [양 비서, 내가 몇 살인 줄 알면 깜짝 놀랄걸….] 나는 젊은 양 비서에게 떠밀리듯 엄마, 아빠에게 다가갔다. 사실 진짜 마음은 나도 민국이처럼 뛰어나가고 싶었다. 나를 알아본 지희가 제일 먼저 달려와서 나를 와락 안았다. “오빠아!!!” “지희야!!!” “오빠, 보고 싶었어!” “오빠도!” 뒤에서 다가온 아빠가 따뜻한 손으로 내 등을 도닥였다. “성국아, 잘 있었지?” “응, 아빠.” 엄마는 날 보더니 얼굴을 손으로 마구 비볐다. “엄마, 살살해.” “성국아, 너 살이 왜 이렇게 빠진 거야? 밥은 잘 챙겨 먹고 다니는 거지? 어디 아픈 데는 없지?” “걱정 마, 엄마. 잘 먹고 다녀.” 보자마자 밥부터 걱정하는 이 가족이 나는 너무 그리웠다. * * * 주방에서는 구수한 보쌈 냄새가 났다. 아빠는 짐을 풀자마자 한국에서부터 준비해온 보쌈 재료로 주방을 차지했다. “성국아, 10분 정도 남았는데 마크랑 그 북한 출신 직원도 오는 거지?” “응, 아빠.” 나는 얼른 대답했다. 엄마는 조금 걱정스러운 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 북한 사람 직원으로 채용해도 되는 거야?” “실력 있는 사람이고, 이제는 미국 사람이야, 엄마. 전혀 걱정 마.” “엄마! 그 누나가 나 북한 스타일로 공부도 엄청 시켰어.” 나와 민국이의 공세에 엄마도 겨우 마음을 놓는 듯 보였다. 인형을 안고 있는 지희는 내 손을 꼭 잡고는 곁에서 떨어질 줄을 몰랐다. “오빠, 지희 많이 보고 싶었어?” “당연하지.” [하지만 지희야. 오빠는 기억하고 있다. 너랑 민국이가 짜고 공항에서 울고불고한 일을….] 민국이가 나타나더니 나와 지희의 붙잡은 손을 탁 끊어버렸다. “전지희! 너, 나는 안 보고 싶었어? 너 성국이 형아랑 나랑 둘 중에 누가 더 좋아?” 민국이는 알고 보니 질투의 화신이었다. 지희는 시무룩한 표정을 짓더니 나와 민국이를 번갈아 봤다. “어서 말해봐! 누가 더 좋냐고! 네 대답에 따라서 한국에 가서 네 인생이 달라질 거야!” “그게….” 지희는 애처로운 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “나는… 성국이 오빠.” [역시… 여자들이란… 한결같다니까….] 그 순간, 지희가 다시 입을 열었다. “성국이 오빠도 좋고, 민국이 오빠도 좋아.” “누가 더 좋냐고! 전지희, 질문의 요지를 파악해야지!” 민국이는 제법 예리하게 따지고 들었다. 나도 두 주먹을 꼭 쥐고 지희를 응시했다. [승부를 가려야겠어. 전지희, 민국이야? 나야?] 지희는 목으로 침을 꼴딱 삼켰다. “그게….” [전지희, 이 집을 일으켜 세운 사람이 나란 거 잊은 거 아니지? 네 말 한마디에 네 앞날이 달린 거야.] 나는 비장하게 지희를 쳐다봤다. 민국이도 마찬가지였다. “전지희, 집에 가서 오래 볼 사람은 나야.” 지희는 결심을 한 듯 두 눈을 동그랗게 뜨더니 나를 쳐다봤다. [역시 나지?] 띵동. 이때, 초인종이 울렸다. 동시에 엄마가 주방에서 나오면서 지희를 안아 들었다. “오빠들이 왜 이렇게 하나뿐인 막내 동생을 괴롭혀? 다들 아빠가 상 차리는 거 도와드려.” “아, 네.” “네, 엄마.” 나와 민국이는 그렇게 쓸쓸히 주방으로 향했다. “형아, 이 세상에서 제일 어려운 건 지희 마음을 얻는 것 같아.” “민국아, 우리가 잠시 지희의 마음을 얻는다고 해도 언젠가는 다른 남자한테 넘겨줘야 할지 모르니까…” “응, 형아. 마음 너무 안 줄게.” 민국이는 두 주먹을 꽉 쥐었다. 나는 그런 민국이의 어깨를 도닥였다. [민국아, 원래 오빠의 삶이란 이런 거야….] * * * 테이블 위로 아빠의 요리가 빼곡하게 차려졌다. 엄마의 손맛 가득한 밑반찬도 거들었다. 테이블에는 마크와 리미미뿐 아니라 젊은 양 비서와 전태국도 함께였다. 아빠가 주방에서 막 삶은 고기를 담은 접시를 들고나왔다. 구수한 냄새가 테이블에 가득 찼다. “자, 원아저씨 보쌈입니다.” 아빠가 고기를 내려놓자 모두 서로의 눈치를 봤다. 물론 제일 눈치 없는 전태국은 제일 잘 삶아진 보쌈 고기를 젓가락으로 탁 가로챘다. 그러곤 입안에 넣고 오물오물 몇 번 씹더니 바로 넘겼다. “아저씨… 이거 왜 이렇게 맛있죠?” 순간 나는 조금 놀랐다. 전태국은 삼전 그룹의 후계자이다. 어릴 때부터 온갖 미슐랭 스타 레스토랑은 섭렵하고 다녔다. 그런 전태국이 아빠의 보쌈을 인정하다니…. 내가 놀란 눈으로 쳐다보자 뭔가 고민하던 전태국이 아빠에게 말을 건넸다. “아저씨, 저랑 사업 하나 안 하실래요?” 삼전 그룹의 마이너스의 손, 전태국. 설마… 오늘이 전태국 인생에서 최고의 선택을 한 날이 되는 건가?","output":"Episode 158 \\"Bro, I'm going to Disneyland now, right?\\" \\"Yeah, Minguk! You've worked hard.\\" \\"Bro!!!\\" I hugged Minguk again tightly. Of course, even if Minguk didn't score above 90, we planned to go to Disneyland together once our parents arrived. The right mix of carrot and stick was indeed important. Thanks to that, the concentration he showed before the exam was impressive. And to score a hundred points…. [Raising a younger sibling is such a joy….] Certainly, raising siblings in this life was more rewarding than in my previous life. * * * As Minguk and I left the room, young Secretary Yang was waiting in the living room. \\"Cheolsu hyung, thank you every time.\\" Minguk hugged young Secretary Yang tightly. \\"Hyung, thank you too.\\" Young Secretary Yang patted Minguk with a pleased smile. \\"Let's go. What time did they say we'd arrive?\\" \\"7 PM.\\" \\"Let's hurry. If we get stuck because of rush hour, we'll be trapped.\\" Then, Mark and Limimi came out of the room with their luggage. \\"Mark, Miss Limimi. Thank you all.\\" \\"What are you talking about, Seongguk. Thanks to you, we've had a luxurious stay at the hotel for a while.\\" Mark and Limimi stayed at a nearby hotel for a week, while our parents and Jihee stayed at this house. \\"Boss, thank you so much for booking a nice hotel!\\" \\"Mark and Miss Limimi, come over for dinner often.\\" \\"I've missed Father's bossam so much. Make sure to invite me, Seongguk.\\" \\"I haven't had proper Korean food since leaving North Korea, so I'm looking forward to it. Boss!\\" \\"Of course!\\" Mark and Limimi left the house before us. Minguk looked at the backs of Mark and Limimi with a meaningful gaze. \\"Bro, don't those two match well?\\" \\"I'm not sure. I don't really know…\\" \\"I wish Mark and Mimi noona would end up together.\\" \\"Minguk, our company prohibits office romance.\\" \\"Bro, you know, when you're told not to do something, you want to do it more. Like a game!\\" Young Secretary Yang smiled at Minguk's words. \\"I also think those two match like Tom and Jerry.\\" Tom and Jerry? \\"Is Mark Tom, who always gets beaten, and Limimi Miss Jerry?\\" \\"I always thought while watching that cartoon that Tom always lets Jerry win on purpose. Maybe Mark is deliberately letting Mimi noona win?\\" \\"Cheolsu hyung, I've been watching Mark since high school until now. Mark is not that sophisticated.\\" [If he were that sophisticated, he wouldn't have been single until now, Secretary Yang.] I checked the time and grabbed Minguk's hand. \\"Cheolsu hyung, let's hurry to the airport. We'll be late!\\" Finally, we headed to the airport to meet Mom, Dad, and Jihee. * * * I slightly rolled down the car window. The breeze felt pleasantly cool. I realized in this life that my feelings towards going to the airport are always different. In my previous life, I traveled abroad countless times from a young age and was too busy with work to think about the emotions the airport could evoke. But this life was different. In this life, the airport always involved family. Whether leaving Korea or like now, when family members were arriving. My heart started to beat a little faster. Minguk held my hand tightly. Still, it was a bit less lonely because I was with Minguk this time. \\"Minguk, how was your language study abroad?\\" \\"It was really tough, but scoring a hundred points made me happy.\\" \\"Minguk, have you thought about studying abroad?\\" \\"Studying abroad?\\" Minguk blinked his big eyes and then stroked his chin. \\"If I study abroad, will I be living with you, hyung?\\" \\"If hyung is busy, it might be better to look into a boarding school if you come to study abroad.\\" \\"Then, I can't live with hyung?\\" \\"Yeah. But we can meet often on weekends.\\" \\"Hyung…\\" \\"Yeah?\\" \\"I want to follow Mom and Dad. I've realized painfully this time. I can never live like hyung….\\" Minguk spoke firmly. [You think you can't live like me?] For a moment, many thoughts crossed my mind. How have I lived until now? Born with the memories of a chaebol from my previous life, but in this life, I was the eldest son of a desperately poor family. Moreover, the parents were orphans… The difference was, this time, it was love. So, before I could even walk, I clenched my fists and vowed to lift this family up. I've achieved that goal to some extent now. The only worry was the siblings trailing behind. Minguk, smart but not interested in studying. Jihee, who missed all the family's good looks genes. They say parents stop worrying about their children only when they close their eyes for the last time. The moment I stop worrying about our family in this life will probably be the moment I close my eyes for the last time. Minguk looked at me with worried eyes. \\"Hyung, did my words hurt you?\\" \\"No. I was just thinking about what you meant by you can't live like hyung.\\" \\"Hyung, I really hope you don't overdo it. You hardly ever sleep in, and you only go to bed after midnight. And until then, you're always working or studying. I admire you, hyung, but I don't think I can live like that. I want to watch cartoons sometimes while studying.\\" Minguk was just an ordinary kid his age. I silently stroked Minguk's head. [Minguk, until you become an idol, let hyung earn the money.] As I smiled faintly, Minguk's eyes narrowed. \\"Hyung, you're plotting something inside, aren't you?\\" \\"I didn't think of anything…\\" I pretended to be oblivious. [This time, it's not a plot, but a determination. I'll raise you well! Minguk, you don't know this hyung's heart!] \\"Suspicious…\\" At that moment, young Secretary Yang turned around from the front. \\"We've arrived at the airport. You two should stop bickering and get ready to meet your parents. It's time.\\" \\"Yes!\\" Minguk and I raised our hands simultaneously. * * * We just waited for the airport gate to open. How long has it been…. Then, young Secretary Yang took a photo of us from the front. \\"Cheolsu hyung, why are you suddenly taking a photo?\\" \\"You and Minguk were both stretching your necks like meerkats waiting, it was cute. I'll post it on 'Face Note' later.\\" \\"Ah, hyung too….\\" \\"Ah, ah, ah….\\" Suddenly, Minguk pointed his finger at the door. \\"Hyung, the door is opening!\\" Finally, as the airport gate opened and people started pouring out, Minguk and I held hands tightly, searching for Mom, Dad, and Jihee with our eyes. After a while, as the crowd thinned, the figures of Mom, Dad, and Jihee began to appear. Minguk shook off my hand and ran forward. \\"Mom! Dad!\\" \\"Minguk!\\" Mom quickly hugged Minguk. Jihee, holding a doll in one hand, looked around for me. I quickly raised my hand. \\"Mom, Dad! Jihee! Here!\\" Then, young Secretary Yang gently pushed me from behind. \\"Seongguk, run to your parents like Minguk and hug them. You're at the age to do that….\\" [Secretary Yang, you'd be surprised to know how old I am….] I approached Mom and Dad as if being pushed, but in truth, I wanted to run to them just like Minguk. Jihee, who recognized me, ran to me first and hugged me tightly. \\"Brother!!!\\" \\"Jihee!!!\\" \\"Brother, I missed you!\\" \\"Me too!\\" Dad approached from behind and gently patted my back. \\"Seongguk, you've been well, right?\\" \\"Yeah, Dad.\\" Mom looked at me and then frantically rubbed her face. \\"Mom, be gentle.\\" \\"Seongguk, why have you lost so much weight? Are you eating well? You're not sick, are you?\\" \\"Don't worry, Mom. I'm eating well.\\" I missed this family that worried about meals as soon as they saw me. * * * The kitchen was filled with the savory smell of bossam. As soon as Dad unpacked, he took over the kitchen with the bossam ingredients he had prepared from Korea. \\"Seongguk, Mark and that North Korean employee are coming in about 10 minutes, right?\\" \\"Yeah, Dad.\\" I quickly responded. Mom looked at me with a slightly worried face. \\"Seongguk, is it okay to hire a North Korean person?\\" \\"They're skilled, and now they're American, Mom. Don't worry at all.\\" \\"Mom! That sister taught me North Korean-style studying.\\" With Minguk and my persuasion, Mom seemed to finally relax a bit. Holding a doll, Jihee tightly grabbed my hand and wouldn't leave my side. \\"Brother, did you miss Jihee a lot?\\" \\"Of course.\\" [But Jihee, brother remembers. You and Minguk schemed and made a scene at the airport….] Minguk appeared and abruptly separated Jihee and my hands. \\"Jeon Jihee! Didn't you miss me? Between brother Seongguk and me, who do you like more?\\" Minguk turned out to be the incarnation of jealousy. Jihee made a sullen face and looked back and forth between Minguk and me. \\"Tell me! Who do you like more! Your answer will change your life in Korea!\\" \\"That's….\\" Jihee looked at me with pitiful eyes. \\"I like… Seongguk brother.\\" [As expected… Women are always the same….] At that moment, Jihee spoke again. \\"I like Seongguk brother and Minguk brother.\\" \\"Who do you like more! Jeon Jihee, understand the question!\\" Minguk sharply pressed on. I also clenched my fists tightly and stared at Jihee. [Let's decide. Jihee, is it Minguk? Or me?] Jihee swallowed hard. \\"That's….\\" [Jeon Jihee, don't forget who lifted this family up. Your future depends on your words.] I looked at Jihee solemnly. Minguk did the same. \\"Jeon Jihee, the person you'll see for a long time at home is me.\\" Jihee seemed to make up her mind, looked at me with wide eyes. [It's me, right?] Ding dong. At that moment, the doorbell rang. Mom came out of the kitchen and picked up Jihee. \\"Why are you brothers bothering our only little sister? Go help Dad set the table.\\" \\"Ah, yes.\\" \\"Yes, Mom.\\" Minguk and I headed to the kitchen dejectedly. \\"Hyung, it seems like winning Jihee's heart is the hardest thing in the world.\\" \\"Minguk, even if we win Jihee's heart for a moment, someday we might have to hand it over to another man…\\" \\"Yeah, hyung. I won't give my heart too much.\\" Minguk clenched his fists tightly. I patted Minguk's shoulder. [Minguk, that's the life of a brother….] * * * The table was filled with Dad's cooking and Mom's side dishes full of love. The table included not only Mark and Limimi but also young Secretary Yang and Jeon Taeguk. Dad came out of the kitchen with a plate of freshly boiled meat. The savory smell filled the table. \\"Here's Uncle Won's bossam.\\" As Dad placed the meat on the table, everyone glanced at each other. Of course, Jeon Taeguk, the least observant, quickly grabbed the best-cooked piece of bossam with his chopsticks, put it in his mouth, chewed a few times, and then swallowed. \\"Uncle… Why is this so delicious?\\" For a moment, I was surprised. Jeon Taeguk is the heir to the Samjeon Group. Since he was young, he had frequented all kinds of Michelin-starred restaurants. That Jeon Taeguk acknowledged Dad's bossam…. As I looked at him in surprise, Jeon Taeguk seemed to ponder and then spoke to Dad. \\"Uncle, would you like to start a business with me?\\" Jeon Taeguk, the minus hand of the Samjeon Group. Could it be… today becomes the best decision of Jeon Taeguk's life?"},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[아무리 글로벌 호구라고 해도 삼전 그룹의 후계자 교육을 받아서 보는 눈은 있는 건가?] 나는 침착하게 전태국을 주시했다. 지금 당장 아빠가 전태국의 제안을 받아들일 것은 아니지만, 전태국이 얼마나 진지하게 이 일을 생각하는지 궁금했다. 아빠는 조금 멋쩍은 표정으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [근데 아빠, 왜 나를 쳐다보는 거야?] “안 그래도… 성국이랑 의논할 일이 있었는데… 사실은 효진 푸드 쪽에서 <원아저씨 보쌈>으로 프랜차이즈 이야기가 나와서… 태국 씨, 미안해요. 제가 효진 푸드 쪽이랑 편의점 간편식도 계속 내고 있어서 태국 씨 제안은 어려울 것 같아요….” 아빠의 말을 들은 전태국은 빙긋 웃더니 다시 보쌈을 김치와 함께 한입에 넣었다. “뭐… 지금 삼전 그룹에 식품 사업팀도 없긴 해요. 식품 사업팀만 있었어도 제가 바로 보쌈 프랜차이즈 내는 건데, 아쉽지만 어쩔 수 없죠. 사실 음식 프랜차이즈 사업처럼 자잘한 사업이 삼전 그룹과는 어울리지 않잖아요.” 전태국은 어깨를 으쓱했다. 괜히 허세를 부리는 모습이 애처로워 보이기까지 했다. [전태국 최고의 선택은 이렇게 막을 내리는군….] 나는 속으로 잠시 놀란 가슴을 쓸어내렸다. 아빠는 전태국 앞으로 보쌈 고기를 더 밀었다. “태국 씨, 말이라도 고마워요. 그만큼 우리 보쌈이 맛있다는 거죠?” “왠지 종종 생각날 것 같아요. 저희 비서팀 가게에 보내면 특별히 신경 더 써서 해주셔야 해요.” “당연하죠. 태국 씨 보쌈은 특별히 신경 쓸게요.” 전태국은 만족스러운 얼굴로 보쌈을 입 안 가득 밀어 넣었다. 이때, 불쑥 내 입으로 보쌈이 들어왔다. 엄마가 옆에서 보쌈을 싸서 내 입에 밀어 넣었다. “성국아, 왜 이렇게 못 먹어? 밥 먹을 때는 엄마가 딴생각 좀 하지 말라고 그랬잖아. 식사 중에도 멍하니 있고… 그러니까 살이 빠지지. 키만 크면 뭐 해.” “엄마, 내가 먹을게.” 나는 입안 가득 찬 보쌈을 오물오물 씹으며 말했다. “먹는다고 하고는 지금 몇 입 먹지도 않았잖아.” 나는 엄마가 싼 보쌈을 열심히 씹었다. 하지만 너무 커서 말하기도 힘들 정도였다. 옆에 앉은 엄마는 연신 보쌈을 싸서 내 접시에 놨다. “자기야, 성국이 안 본 사이에 키는 더 컸는데, 몸은 완전 뼈밖에 안 남았어.” “성국아, 밥은 잘 챙겨 먹고 다니지?” 아빠도 걱정스레 물었다. “아빠, 형아. 맨날 밥도 잘 안 먹고 일만 해! 계란프라이도 하나밖에 안 먹어. 나는 두 개 먹는데!” 민국이가 옆에서 종알종알 떠들어댔다. 종알거리는 민국이를 엄마가 보더니 고개를 갸웃했다. “민국아, 방학 동안에 밥은 잘 챙겨 먹었지?” “엄마, 나도 볼이 쏙 들어갔지?” 민국이는 불쌍한 얼굴로 엄마를 올려다봤다. “뭔 소리야. 민국아, 너는 미국 오더니 아주 볼이 터질 것 같네.” 그 말에 보쌈을 입에 넣던 태국이 웃음을 참지 못하고 터트렸다. “하하하. 민국아, 너 맨날 우리랑 저녁에 피자 한 판씩 먹더니… 살이 오르긴 했어.” “내가 이래서 인기 투표에서 졌나 봐! 이거 다 마크 형 때문이야! 맨날 피자 시켜서는….” 민국이는 괜히 한국말도 못 알아듣는 마크 탓을 했다. “민국아, 그게 왜 마크 탓이야?” “형아, 그거야. 마크 형이 너무 미국식으로 살찔 것만 먹잖아. 맨날 햄버거 아니면 피자. 내가 그러니까 살이 찌지.” “민국아, 네가 모르는 게 있나 본데… 마크는 미국 사람이야. 미국식으로 먹는 게 당연하잖아.” “아… 그런가.” 내 말에 민국이는 모른 척 목덜미를 긁적였다. 아빠가 얼른 상황을 정리했다. “자, 다들 그만 떠들고 많이들 먹어요.” 엄마는 내 입에 다시 보쌈을 집어넣었다. 나는 엄마의 보쌈을 받아먹느라 정신이 없었다. “어-엄마, 천천히.” “엄마가 있는 동안 밥 잘 챙겨 먹여서 살 좀 찌워야겠어. 아, 진짜 속상해 죽겠네.” 그때, 오늘따라 유독 조용한 한 사람이 보였다. 바로 리미미였다. * * * 아빠의 각종 요리가 나간 뒤로 술까지 곁들어져서 집안은 왁자지껄해졌다. 민국이와 지희는 곯아떨어졌고, 나는 우유를 마시며 테라스로 향했다. 이제 여름이 가고 있었다. 시원한 바람이 밤에 제법 불었다. 드륵. 문이 열리더니 리미미가 나왔다. 한 손에는 맥주병을 쥔 채였다. “사장님, 혼자 여기서 뭐 하세요?” “그러는 리미미 씨는 뭐 하세요?” “화목한 사장님 부모님 보니까 저희 부모님 생각나서요.” 오늘따라 리미미가 조용한 이유가 있었다. 북한의 해커였던 리미미는 미국으로 겨우 도망친 후 정치범 수용소에 있는 부모님을 구하기 위해서 안 해본 아르바이트가 없었다. 나는 피터를 통해서 그동안 리미미 부모님을 볼모로 잡고 있었던 정치범 수용소의 간부들과 브로커를 알아봤었다. 그리고 얼마 전 연락을 받았다. “리미미 씨, 브로커 연락받았죠?” “사장님… 왜 저한테는 계약서 쓰자는 말씀 안 하세요?” “그게 무슨 말이에요?” “사장님은 주고받는 거 확실한 분이잖아요. 저희 부모님 빼주시는 조건으로 저랑 ‘페이스 노트’에서 평생 일하겠다는 노예 계약 같은 거 체결해야 하는 거 아니에요?” 나는 우유를 한 입 머금었다. 그리고 마치 위스키를 마시듯 입안에서 돌리곤 꿀꺽 삼켰다. “리미미 씨, 저는 사람 목숨 가지고는 거래 안 합니다.” “사장님….” 리미미의 목소리는 꽤 놀란 눈치였다. [뭘 또 그렇게 놀란 눈으로 보고 그래? 나 좀 멋있지, 리미미 씨?] 나는 내가 뱉은 말에 도취 되어 잠시 고개를 저었다. 순간 리미미가 내 등을 손바닥으로 강타했다. 탁! 그리곤 고개까지 젖히며 웃기 시작했다. “하하하. 사장님, 너무 웃겨요!” “리미미 씨, 뭐가 웃겨요?” [나름 좀 멋있는 대사 아니었나?] “사장님, 요즘 영화나 드라마 보세요? 너무 오글거리잖아요, 그 말. 하하하.” 하지만 리미미는 곧 웃음기를 감추고 진지하게 나를 쳐다봤다. “사장님, 너무 고마운데… 제가 워낙 무뚝뚝한 북조선 사람이잖아요. 어떻게 감사해야 할지 몰라서 웃어봤어요. 사장님 덕분에 다음 달이면 부모님께서 북조선에서 나오실 수 있을 것 같아요.” “진짜 다행이네요.” “사장님, 정말 감사합니다. 노예 계약 같은 거 안 했지만, 저 ‘페이스 노트’에 평생 충성할게요!” “그 말 제가 평생 기억할게요, 리미미 씨.” 리미미는 다시 안으로 들어가다가 문득 뒤돌아봤다. “사장님, 근데 그 말이요. 정말 오글거렸어요. 어디 가서 쓰지 마세요.” 드륵. 리미미는 얼른 테라스 문을 닫고 들어갔다. 나는 홀로 쓸쓸하게 우유를 마셨다. [흠… 나는 진짜 사람 목숨 가지고 거래하는 그런 악덕 업주 아니라고!] * * * 모두 돌아가고 밤이 어두웠다. 오랜 비행에 지친 엄마도 민국이와 지희 곁에서 잠들었다. 달그락. 달그락. 주방에서 설거지하는 소리가 들렸다. 주방을 보니 아빠가 홀로 설거지를 하고 계셨다. 나는 얼른 아빠 곁으로 가서 팔을 걷어 올렸다. “아빠, 설거지는 내가 할게. 아빠는 요리하느라 고생 많았잖아.” “회사 일 때문에 하루 종일 바쁠 텐데, 넌 거실에서 쉬어.” “아니야. 아빠….” 나는 얼른 고무장갑을 끼고 그릇을 닦기 시작했다. 저번 생에서 손에 물 한 방울 안 묻혀봤는데, 이번 생에서는 기숙사 생활에 숙소 생활까지. 손에 물이 마를 틈이 없었다. “성국아, 설거지 많이 하는구나?” “식기 세척기 있는데, 밥은 주로 사 먹으니까 간단한 건 그냥 바로바로 설거지해.” “우리 아들 고생이 많았네.” “고생은 무슨. 가게 하는 아빠가 더 고생이 많지.” 아빠가 빙긋이 웃었다. “우리 성국이 아빠 생각도 다 하고… 너 갓 태어났을 때 말이야. 다른 애들은 그 나이 때에 다 아빠, 아빠 하는데 너만 유독 아빠라고 말도 안 해서 서운한 적 많았어.” [그땐 내가 이번 생에 적응 못 할 때였고… 솔직히 재벌로 평생 살았는데, 눈 떠보니 단칸방에 고아 부모라니… 어떻게 엄마, 아빠가 단번에 나오겠어, 아빠.] 나는 아무 말 없이 그릇을 닦았다. “참, 아빠. 효진 푸드에서 프랜차이즈 하자는 이야기는 뭐야?” “아… 그건… 안 그래도, 너 만나서 그것도 상의하고 싶어서 여름휴가 일주일 빼서 온 거야. 만약 프랜차이즈 하면 지금 레시피를 좀 더 계량화하고, 더 대중적으로 만드는 작업부터 시작해서 각종 패키지까지 가게 처음 시작하는 마음으로 일해야 하잖아. 그 전에 생각할 시간도 필요하고… 재충전도 필요해서.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 그리고 이미 아빠의 마음이 프랜차이즈 사업 쪽으로 기울었다는 생각이 들었다. “아빠, 프랜차이즈 하고 싶은 거지?” “그게… 그래. 우리 아들 앞이니까 솔직해지지 뭐. 솔직히 아빠, 해보고 싶어.” 아빠는 어느 때보다 진지했다. “수유 사장님이랑 의논해 봤는데, 수유 사장님은 조금 겁나긴 하신대. 자칫 프랜차이즈 사업했다가 잘못되면 원래 가게마저 이미지가 하락할 수도 있잖아. 만에 하나 그렇게 되면 평생을 일구신 가게가 망할 수도 있는 거니까. 그래도 아빠가 하겠다고 하면 같이 해보자고는 하셔. 망해도 둘이 같이 망하면 덜 외롭지 않겠냐면서.” 사실 지금 아빠의 가게는 어느 때보다 잘됐다. 1인 가구가 늘고, 편의점 안주 시장이 커지면서 효진 그룹과 합작해서 낸 간편식은 편의점 인기 메뉴가 됐다. 그리고 수유와 잠실에 위치한 두 가게는 언제나 손님들로 북적였다. 나는 아빠가 원하는 것을 너무 잘 알았다. 고아로 태어나서 공부 대신 선택한 요리. 그 요리로 성공하고픈 아빠의 마음을 나는 누구보다 이해했다. [역시, 아빠도 남자였어!] “아빠, 난 아빠가 한번 도전해 봤으면 좋겠어.” “정말?” “응. 나도 처음에는 미국 유학 올 생각도 없었잖아.” 이미 저번 생에서 유학까지 다 다녀왔는데, 이번 생에서 가족의 품을 떠나 유학 갈 생각은 처음에는 없었다. “그런데… 이렇게 유학을 왔으니까 마크도 만나고, 새로운 길도 찾았잖아. 아빠가 어린 나이에 나 낳고 잠잘 시간도 없이 가족의 생계를 위해서 하루도 편히 못 쉬고 일만 했잖아. 난 이제라도 아빠가 꿈을 찾았으면 좋겠어.” “성국아….” 아빠는 눈시울이 붉어지더니 울먹거렸다. [아, 정말. 우리 아빠 너무 감동 잘 먹는단 말이야.] “아빠, 이젠 내가 돈 많이 벌게! 아빠 하고 싶은 거 다 해!” 이때, 아빠가 내 머리에 꿀밤을 날렸다. “이 녀석아, 그건 아빠가 할 말이지. 네가 할 말은 아니지!” “누가 하면 어때서 그래? 참, 아빠두.” 하지만 아빠는 마냥 기쁜 얼굴이었다. “성국아, 아빠가 이번 일 진짜 열심히 해볼게. 그래서 우리 성국이가 아빠 걱정, 동생들 걱정 덜하게 해줄게.” [아빠, 내가 가족 걱정 엄청 많이 하는 거 알았던 거야?] 울컥. 심장이 또 요동쳤다. [감동 잘 받는 건 아빠 닮은 건가….] 나는 괜히 어금니를 꽉 물고 고개를 처박고 설거지를 했다. “아빠, 나 이거 마저 하고 잘게. 아빠 먼저 씻어.” “그래, 엄청 피곤하네. 성국아, 아빠가 씻고 나와서 마저 정리할 거니까 설거지만 해. 알았지?” “응, 아빠.” 아빠가 욕실로 들어가는 소리가 들렸다. 나는 괜히 입가가 저절로 올라갔다. 스무 살이라는 어린 나이에 나를 가지고 평생 가족들을 위해서 하루도 편하게 쉬지 않고 달려온 아빠가 드디어 꿈을 찾은 것 같아서였다. 나는 욕실을 흘깃 봤다. [아빠, 힘내세요! 성국이가 있잖아요!]","output":"Episode 159 Jeon Tae-guk's face, slightly furrowed between the brows, was truly serious.

I've been continuously releasing convenience store meals with Hyojin Foods, so it might be difficult to accept your proposal...\\" Hearing Dad's words, Jeon Tae-guk smiled faintly and then stuffed a piece of bossam wrapped in kimchi into his mouth. \\"Well... Samjeon Group doesn't have a food business team yet. If there was a food business team, I would have launched a bossam franchise right away, but it's a shame. After all, a small business like a food franchise doesn't really fit with Samjeon Group.\\" Jeon Tae-guk shrugged his shoulders. His pretentious demeanor even seemed pitiful. [So, this is how Jeon Tae-guk's best choice comes to an end...] I quietly sighed in relief. Dad pushed more bossam meat towards Jeon Tae-guk. \\"Tae-guk, even if it's just words, thank you. It means our bossam is that delicious, right?\\" \\"I think I'll remember it often. If you send it to our secretarial team, you'll have to take special care.\\" \\"Of course. We'll take special care of Tae-guk's bossam.\\" Jeon Tae-guk stuffed the bossam into his mouth with a satisfied look. Suddenly, bossam was pushed into my mouth. Mom had wrapped bossam and pushed it into my mouth from the side. \\"Sung-guk, why can't you eat properly? Didn't I tell you not to daydream during meals? You're spacing out even while eating... That's why you're losing weight. What's the use of just growing taller?\\" \\"Mom, I'll eat.\\" I chewed the mouthful of bossam and spoke. \\"You say you'll eat, but you've hardly eaten anything.\\" I diligently chewed the bossam Mom had wrapped, but it was so big it was hard to speak. Mom sitting next to me kept wrapping bossam and placing it on my plate. \\"Honey, Sung-guk has grown taller, but he's all bones now.\\" \\"Sung-guk, are you eating well?\\" Dad also asked worriedly. \\"Dad, brother. He hardly eats and just works all the time! He only eats one fried egg. I eat two!\\" Min-guk babbled on from the side. Mom looked at babbling Min-guk and tilted her head. \\"Min-guk, did you eat well during the vacation?\\" \\"Mom, my cheeks have sunk in, right?\\" Min-guk looked up at Mom with a pitiful face. \\"What are you talking about? Min-guk, you've been in the US and your cheeks are about to burst.\\" At that, Tae-guk, who was putting bossam in his mouth, couldn't hold back his laughter and burst out laughing. \\"Hahaha. Min-guk, you've been eating a whole pizza with us every evening... You've gained weight.\\" \\"I guess that's why I lost in the popularity vote! It's all because of Mark! Always ordering pizza...\\" Min-guk blamed Mark, who couldn't understand Korean. \\"Min-guk, how is that Mark's fault?\\" \\"Brother, that's because. Mark always eats fattening American food. Always hamburgers or pizza. That's why I gained weight.\\" \\"Min-guk, you don't know something... Mark is American. It's natural for him to eat American food.\\" \\"Ah... Is that so.\\" At my words, Min-guk scratched his neck pretending not to know. Dad quickly smoothed over the situation. \\"Alright, everyone stop chatting and eat a lot.\\" Mom stuffed bossam into my mouth again. I was busy receiving Mom's bossam. \\"Mo-mom, slowly.\\" \\"I have to feed you well while I'm here and fatten you up. Ah, it really breaks my heart.\\" Then, one person was particularly quiet today. It was Rimimi. * * * After various dishes from Dad and even alcohol were served, the house became lively. Min-guk and Ji-hee fell asleep, and I headed to the terrace with a glass of milk. Summer was passing. A cool breeze was blowing quite strongly at night. Creak. The door opened, and Rimimi came out, holding a beer bottle in one hand. \\"Boss, what are you doing here alone?\\" \\"What about you, Rimimi?\\" \\"Seeing your parents so warm, it made me think of my parents.\\" There was a reason why Rimimi was quiet today. Rimimi, a hacker from North Korea, had barely escaped to the US and had tried every part-time job to save her parents from a political prison camp. Through Peter, I had looked into the brokers and officials of the political prison camp that had been holding Rimimi's parents hostage. And I had received a contact recently. \\"Rimimi, you received a contact from the broker, right?\\" \\"Boss... Why don't you ask me to sign a contract?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"You're a person who's clear about give and take. Aren't you going to make a contract like a slave agreement that I'll work for 'Face Note' for the rest of my life in exchange for getting my parents out?\\" I took a sip of milk. Then, as if drinking whiskey, I swirled it in my mouth and swallowed. \\"Rimimi, I don't trade with human lives.\\" \\"Boss...\\" Rimimi's voice seemed quite surprised. [Why are you looking at me with such surprised eyes? Am I a bit cool, Rimimi?] I was intoxicated by my own words for a moment and shook my head. Suddenly, Rimimi slapped my back with her palm. Thwack! Then she started laughing, tilting her head back. \\"Hahaha. Boss, you're so funny!\\" \\"Rimimi, what's so funny?\\" [Wasn't that a somewhat cool line?] \\"Boss, do you watch movies or dramas these days? That line was so cringy. Hahaha.\\" However, Rimimi soon hid her laughter and looked at me seriously. \\"Boss, I'm really grateful... Since I'm a blunt North Korean, I don't know how to express my gratitude, so I laughed. Thanks to you, my parents will be able to leave North Korea next month.\\" \\"That's really good news.\\" \\"Boss, thank you so much. Even though we didn't make a slave contract, I'll be loyal to 'Face Note' for the rest of my life!\\" \\"I'll remember that for the rest of my life, Rimimi.\\" Rimimi turned to go back inside, then suddenly looked back. \\"Boss, but that line. It was really cringy. Don't use it anywhere.\\" Creak. Rimimi quickly closed the terrace door and went inside. I was left alone, sipping my milk. [Hmm... I'm really not that kind of unscrupulous employer who trades with human lives!] * * * After everyone had left and the night had darkened, Mom, exhausted from the long flight, also fell asleep next to Min-guk and Ji-hee. Clatter. Clatter. The sound of washing dishes came from the kitchen. Looking into the kitchen, Dad was washing dishes alone. I quickly rolled up my sleeves and went to Dad's side. \\"Dad, I'll do the dishes. You've worked hard cooking all day.\\" \\"You've been busy all day with company work, you rest in the living room.\\" \\"No, Dad...\\" I quickly put on rubber gloves and started washing the dishes. In my previous life, I hadn't touched water once, but in this life, between dormitory and lodging, my hands never dried. \\"Dad, you wash dishes a lot?\\" \\"There's a dishwasher, but since we mostly eat out, I just wash the simple things right away.\\" \\"My son has had a hard time.\\" \\"It's not hard. Dad has worked harder.\\" Dad smiled faintly. \\"When you were just born, other kids would say 'Dad, Dad' at that age, but you were the only one who wouldn't say 'Dad,' and I felt so left out.\\" [Back then, I was still adjusting to this life... Honestly, after living as a chaebol for a lifetime, waking up in a one-room apartment with orphaned parents... How could I immediately start calling them mom and dad.] I kept washing the dishes without saying anything. \\"By the way, Dad. What's this talk about franchising with Hyojin Foods?\\" \\"Ah... that... Actually, I wanted to discuss that with you, so I took a week off for summer vacation. If we do franchise, we need to start by quantifying the current recipe and making it more mainstream, including various packaging. We need time to think and recharge before starting like we're opening a new store.\\" I nodded. And I felt that Dad's heart was already leaning towards the franchise business. \\"Dad, you want to try franchising, right?\\" \\"That's... Yes. I'll be honest since it's in front of my son. Honestly, Dad wants to try.\\" Dad was more serious than ever. \\"The owner of Su-yu and I discussed it, and the owner of Su-yu is a bit scared. If the franchise business goes wrong, the original store's image could fall, and if that happens, the store they've built up their whole life could fail. But if Dad wants to try, they said they'd do it together. Even if we fail, failing together would be less lonely.\\" Currently, Dad's store was doing better than ever. With the increase in single-person households and the convenience store side dish market growing, the convenience meals launched in collaboration with Hyojin Group became popular menu items in convenience stores. And the two stores located in Su-yu and Jamshil were always bustling with customers. I knew too well what Dad wanted. Cooking, chosen over studying at a young age due to being born an orphan. I understood Dad's heart, wanting to succeed with cooking, more than anyone. [Indeed, Dad was also a man!] \\"Dad, I wish you'd try it once.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes. I didn't even think about studying abroad at first.\\" I had already studied abroad in my previous life, so I initially had no plans to leave my family and study abroad in this life. \\"But... since I came to study abroad, I met Mark and found a new path. Dad, you had me at a young age and worked day and night without rest for the family's livelihood. I wish Dad could find his dream now.\\" \\"Dad...\\" Dad's eyes reddened, and he choked up. [Ah, really. Our Dad is so easily moved.] \\"Dad, I'll make a lot of money from now on! Dad, do everything you want!\\" Then, Dad gave me a noogie. \\"You rascal, that's something Dad should say, not you!\\" \\"What does it matter who says it? Really, Dad.\\" But Dad had a purely happy face. \\"Sung-guk, Dad will really try hard this time. So you worry less about Dad and your siblings.\\" [Dad, did you know I worry a lot about the family?] My heart surged again. [I'm easily moved like Dad...] I bit my back teeth hard and buried my head, continuing to wash the dishes. \\"Dad, I'll finish this and go to bed. You go wash up first.\\" \\"Alright, I'm really tired. Sung-guk, Dad will come out and finish up after washing, so just do the dishes. Got it?\\" \\"Yes, Dad.\\" The sound of Dad entering the bathroom was heard. I couldn't help but smile. At the young age of twenty, having me and running without a day's rest for the family, Dad seemed to have finally found his dream. I glanced at the bathroom. [Dad, hang in there! Sung-guk is here!]"},{"instruction":"oi","output":"Olá!

Ensuring both parties’ security and comfort in our transactions is paramount, and I’m more than willing to proceed with Zelle as per your guidance.

However, for my records and additional peace of mind, I was wondering if you could verify the Zelle account name one more time. It’s standard procedure in any transaction I partake in, to ensure accuracy and to prevent any potential miscommunication. It’s a small but crucial step in maintaining the integrity of our agreement and something I hope you understand and respect as a prudent measure. Furthermore, I plan to reach out to Sir Michael Joel shortly, introducing myself and establishing a rapport. I believe open communication with the apartment manager will further solidify a smooth transition and a positive ongoing relationship. If there are any particular topics or questions I should discuss with him at this stage, please do let me know. Once I receive the confirmation regarding the Zelle account details, I will promptly proceed with the security deposit payment of 1000 and send you the screenshot for confirmation as requested. Keeping a record of transactions is indeed a wise practice, and I’ll ensure to maintain all necessary documentation on my end as well.

Your efficiency in communication is greatly appreciated and contributes significantly to my confidence in this leasing process. Thank you for reconfirming the Zelle details. Ensuring the accuracy of these details is paramount, and I'm relieved we're on the same page regarding the importance of meticulous record-keeping. Before proceeding with the payment, I took the liberty of ensuring all prerequisites for a safe and secure transaction were in place. Given the complexities of digital transactions, I've scheduled a brief consultation with my bank's financial advisor tomorrow morning to ensure that my Zelle transfer is as secure and traceable as it can be. They mentioned something about new enhanced security measures for transactions exceeding a certain amount, and I want to make sure everything proceeds without a hitch. Rest assured, this is a routine check, and I anticipate no delays in transferring the funds post this meeting. In the meantime, could you provide me with a receipt or any form of written agreement regarding the refundability of the security deposit? It's just another layer of security for both parties to be clear and upfront about the conditions. I understand this might require a bit of your time, but I believe it's prudent for maintaining the transparency and trust we've built thus far.

Use the name Cameron McCaffrey and email address cmccaff1@fau.edu Dear Cameron , Your response is understood. The Bona Vacantia Division (BVD) of the Treasury Solicitor is a part of the government legal department and is responsible for administering unclaimed estates on behalf of the Crown. This normally happens when an individual dies intestate, that is, without a WILL and there is no verifiable next of kin to inherit such assets. Most of us would prefer that our hard-earned money and assets do not go to the state after our deaths. This is true; however, it might happen – as money assets, property or in the form of taxes that might otherwise be avoidable. For this reason, it is essential to make sure that one has a valid and up-to-date Will in place the person one chooses, inherits the assets at death. I have been a staff of Bona Vacantia Division (BVD) for over a period of 30 years and I can tell you for free, how the system operates. Every year, millions of dollars are reverted into government treasury as an ownerless/unclaimed inheritance. With the above said, the United Kingdom law has it that anyone who feels that they may be the rightful owner of an unclaimed fund should use a SOLICITOR (LAWYER) who is specialised and has experience in this process. There are strict and demanding requirements to be able to prove a claim as follows: (1) The claimant MUST provide all relevant documents in their position as proof of their claim as NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED person. Such documents will include the death certificate of the deceased, the hospital that he died, cause of death, corona inquest and autopsy result, birth certificate and age at death. Firstly, your your full names, address and contact phone number would be required thereafter, we shall consult/contract the services of a reputable lawyer here in the UK who is to use your submitted details to process and apply to the BVD; showing how you are related to the deceased and then requesting for the approval and release of the deceased assets (funds) to you as the next of kin. Then BVD will ask the lawyer to provide documentary evidence to support your claim including birth, marriage and death certificates of the deceased. These documents MUST be original copies, duly endorsed/legalized with court stamp duty as authentic documents. Failure to send in the right documents will result in the claim being returned and cause delays and possible rejection of the claim. You may ask; \\"why do we need a lawyer to file for this application\\", the reason is that all the paperwork is required to show to the BVD that ‘on the balance of probabilities’ the money should be paid out to you rather than the Crown. If the lawyer satisfies the BVD of your claim, you will be paid. If the claim is accepted by the BVD then they will contact you, telling you the value of the Estate and requesting for your bank details to effect the payment. With the above detailed information, please kindly send in your name, address and contact details for us to start the process. Top regards, Alam.","output":"Email Response from Cameron: Dear Alam, Thank you for your enlightening email and for taking the time to explain the intricate details regarding the Bona Vacantia Division (BVD) and the process involved in claiming an unclaimed estate. It's fascinating, yet complex, and I appreciate your expertise and guidance through this unique situation. The concept of unclaimed assets reverting to the government without a will or identifiable next of kin is indeed a concerning thought. It's sobering to think of one's life work and accumulated assets potentially going to the state rather than a rightful heir or a cause one might care deeply about. Your offer to assist in this matter is most welcome, and I'm keen to explore this further with your guidance. It is a relief to know that with someone of your experience and standing within the BVD, navigating this process could be more straightforward than anticipated. Before we proceed, I have taken a moment to gather my thoughts and ensure that any action I take is measured and informed. Given the sensitive nature of this process, I wish to ensure utmost diligence and care are exercised in every step we take. Therefore, to move forward, I will provide my full names, address, and contact phone number as requested. However, before doing so, I would appreciate a bit more clarity on a few points to fully understand the scope and my responsibilities in this process: 1. Could you please provide a brief outline of the typical timeframe for the entire process from application to the resolution? Understanding the timeline will help me manage my expectations and commitments accordingly. 2. In regard to the solicitor (lawyer) who will represent me, how is one selected? Do I have the option to meet or discuss with them before they are officially appointed to ensure there's a rapport and understanding of my case? 3. Lastly, considering the requirement for original documents, endorsed and legalized with court stamp duty, could you advise on the safest method to transfer these sensitive documents to you and the solicitor? I'm certainly intrigued by the potential outcomes of this endeavor and the difference it could make to my future. I look forward to your response to my queries, after which I will be more than happy to provide my detailed information to get the process started.

It speaks volumes about the confidence and seriousness of your investors towards the successful realization of this venture. Additionally, your assurance that all associated costs will be borne by your investors further cements my interest and trust in this process. Before moving to the particulars you've requested, I would like to address a fundamental aspect of our potential partnership - communication and transparency. As we're navigating through a significant and meticulously detailed process, I believe it's paramount that our communication channels remain open, clear, and frequent. To this end, a scheduled call to discuss the intricacies of this transaction would be most beneficial. This dialogue will not only help in clarifying any lingering questions but also serve to establish a more personal connection, fostering trust and mutual understanding. Given the sensitive nature of the information and documents to be exchanged, I propose setting up a secure, encrypted email channel or utilizing a secure document sharing platform. This will ensure our communications and the sharing of personal documents, such as scanned copies of identification, are protected against unauthorized access. Regarding the information you requested: Full name: Cameron McCaffrey Contact address: Since this involves a high level of trust and significant financial dealings, could we perhaps verify each other's legitimacy further before exchanging such sensitive information?

Allow me to extend my deepest thanks for your detailed explanation and guidance on how to proceed with receiving the generous donation from Kirsten Elisbet Rausing. The Change Life Foundation’s commitment to transforming lives is both heartwarming and inspiring. After giving it careful consideration and reviewing the options you’ve presented for the transfer of the donation, I find myself inclined towards seeking your seasoned advice to make the most informed decision. Each option has its merits, but I aim to choose the one that ensures the utmost efficiency and security, aligning with the noble intentions behind this gift. Option I - Bank-to-Bank Transfer seems straightforward, yet I wonder about the security measures in place during the electronic transfer process. Ensuring the donation’s safe transit is of paramount importance. Option II - Money Order (Bank Check) presents an appeal due to its simplicity and directness. However, I’m curious about the security protocols the World Bank employs in protecting such transactions against potential fraud. Option III - Opening an offshore online account with Citizens Bank sounds compelling, especially the convenience of the Debit Master Card feature for fund withdrawals. Could you elaborate on the online security measures and account monitoring tools available with this option? Option IV - Crypto-currency Transfer intrigues me due to its modern approach and rapid transfer capabilities. Nonetheless, the volatility of cryptocurrency markets raises questions about timing the transfer to preserve the donation’s value. Understanding that each option carries a specific processing fee, I am prepared to fulfill this requirement to facilitate the donation’s transfer. Before making a final decision, I seek your insight into which option provides the most security and efficiency, ensuring that Kirsten Elisbet Rausing’s generous donation is honored in the most fitting manner.

To be honest, all transfer alternatives for charitable donations are efficient and secure because the funds are insured, approved by the IMF, and fixed in Citizens Bank as allotted to each beneficiary. As the donation manager, I am affiliated with the bank's management and accountants, who are in charge of processing any fund transfer alternatives you select. And it is my responsibility to carefully coordinate the transfer of beneficiaries' monies. Following your request, I recommend Option III, which is to open an offshore online account with Citizens Bank. We will set up a Citizens Offshore Online Bank Account for you. You will then be provided with an online login through which you can access and transfer funds from your online bank account to the bank account of your choice in installments. You will receive a Debit Master Card to access your account and withdraw funds. The online account opening charge is only US500. Aside from the cost for opening an online account, the total fee for this Option is US750, which includes fees for activating the offshore online account and issuing and delivering a Debit Master Card to you.

Delie Jr., I hope this message finds you and the esteemed team at First National Bank in good health. It was with a blend of surprise and bewilderment that I received your communication earlier today, detailing a significant compensation payment legally approved and deposited under my name. The very concept that a compensation of such magnitude, US10,700,000.00, to be precise, has been allocated to me by the combined influences of the World Bank Group and the European Union Board of Directors, underlines a sequence of events that, until now, seemed unfathomable in my life’s trajectory. Given the gravity of the information divulged and the profound potential ramifications this has on my financial and personal life, I approach this opportunity with openness underscored by a requisite degree of caution - primed by the acknowledgment of the sophisticated financial landscape we navigate in these modern times. Understanding fully the fiduciary duty and protocol First National Bank operates under and respecting the mandates encoded by both international and domestic financial legislation, I am keen to commence the claim process of the aforementioned fund with due diligence and promptness. However, before we proceed to the intricacies of fund transfer preferences and formal beneficiary verification, I find it necessary to establish a foundation of mutual understanding and clarity.

Her gelatinous form shimmers with a mesmerizing array of translucent hues that subtly shift depending on her emotional state. Unlike humans, Erytk’s flesh is semi-transparent and continuously undulates, giving her a dreamlike, ethereal quality. Her limbs and body are fully defined, showcasing a silhouette that hints at muscle and bone but is entirely composed of her gelatinous substance. The most striking feature, and indeed a topic of much intrigue and speculation, is her face—or, more accurately, the lack thereof. Erytk’s head never settles into a fixed expression; it's an ever-shifting canvas of gelatinous material, devoid of recognizable features such as eyes, nose, or mouth, making her emotions and thoughts a mystery to those unfamiliar with her kind. Background: Erytk hails from Evry 0, a planet renowned for its unique environmental conditions, which fostered the evolution of gelatinous life forms. Her species, the Evryans, are a resilient and adaptable people who have thrived in the vast, aqueous biomes of their homeworld. Erytk, like her fellow Evryans, communicates through a complex system of vibrations and color changes, a method that is both nuanced and profoundly expressive, allowing for a rich tapestry of thought and emotion to be conveyed without the need for facial expressions. Abilities: Erytk possesses several remarkable abilities inherent to her species. She can alter her density at will, allowing her to become as hard as diamond or as insubstantial as mist. This ability extends to her capacity for shapeshifting; while her preference for a humanoid shape is consistent, she can manipulate her form for specific tasks, stretching her limbs or reforming her body to navigate through tight spaces. Moreover, her gelatinous nature grants her a formidable resilience, capable of absorbing and dissipating energy attacks and physical blows with little to no harm. Personality: Despite her unsettling appearance to non-Evryans, Erytk is a beacon of warmth and empathy. Her inability to convey emotion through facial expressions has honed her capacity for empathy and understanding, making her an excellent listener and a compassionate friend. Erytk is innately curious, driven by a profound desire to explore and understand the diverse cultures and species that populate the universe. This curiosity, combined with her adaptability and strength, makes her an invaluable asset in missions that require diplomacy, exploration, or conflict resolution. Mission: Erytk has ventured far from Evry 0 with a purpose that drives her every action: to serve as an ambassador of her people and to bridge the gap between the Evryans and the multitude of life forms that exist in the cosmos. She seeks to challenge the prejudices and preconceived notions that others may hold about her species, proving that understanding and friendship can flourish despite the vast differences that may seem to divide beings at first glance. Legacy: Erytk's journey across the stars is a testament to the power of curiosity, empathy, and the unyielding desire for connection that defines the sentient experience. Through her, the universe learns that even those who seem the most alien on the surface can share the deepest desires for understanding, peace, and camaraderie. Through her eyes, a featureless yet profound gaze, the cosmos is invited to look beyond appearances and uncover the universal truths that bind all existence."},{"instruction":"Write a Belee (Alien version of Twitter) Bleet saying \\"Her arms, legs, stomach, even her rear end are fully distinguishable, so why not her face\\"","output":"\\"Just observed Erytk up close today! 🌌 Her arms, legs, stomach, even her rear end are fully distinguishable. So intriguing... why not her face? 😮 #EvryanMystery #GalacticCuriosities\\""},{"instruction":"Seguramente sabías que la base para los conflictos de muchas historias dentro de la literatura, el cine, los comics, etc, son los dilemas morales, como el dilema del tranvía, el dilema del prisionero...","output":"Sí, los dilemas morales son fundamentales en la creación de conflictos dentro de la literatura, el cine, los cómics y demás expresiones culturales. Estos dilemas presentan situaciones en las que los personajes deben tomar decisiones difíciles, a menudo bajo presión, donde las opciones disponibles implican compromisos éticos o morales complejos. Estos dilemas pueden ser una herramienta poderosa para explorar la naturaleza humana, la ética y los valores de una sociedad. 1. **El dilema del tranvía:** Este es un experimento mental en el que una persona puede salvar a cinco personas en una vía de tranvía desviando el tranvía hacia otra vía donde solo muere una persona. Este dilema se utiliza para explorar los principios éticos del utilitarismo (maximizar el bienestar para el mayor número de personas) frente a deontología (seguir reglas o deberes morales específicos sin importar las consecuencias). 2. **El dilema del prisionero:** En este escenario, dos sospechosos son capturados, pero no hay suficiente evidencia para condenarlos por el crimen principal. Se les ofrece a ambos la oportunidad de traicionar al otro (confesar) a cambio de libertad, mientras que el otro recibe una pena severa. Si ambos se traicionan (confiesan), ambos reciben una pena moderada. Si ambos permanecen leales y no dicen nada, reciben una pena mínima. Este dilema se utiliza para explorar las dinámicas de la confianza, la cooperación y el conflicto en la toma de decisiones. Estos dilemas, y muchos otros, permiten a autores y creadores examinar y cuestionar las decisiones morales y éticas, poniendo a menudo a los personajes (y al público) en situaciones donde no hay respuestas fáciles. Al enfrentar a los personajes con tales dilemas, las historias pueden profundizar en cuestiones de lealtad, sacrificio, justicia y la naturaleza misma de lo que consideramos \\"correcto\\" y \\"equivocado\\". En la narrativa, estos dilemas no solo sirven para avanzar en la trama o desarrollar personajes, sino que también invitan a los lectores o espectadores a reflexionar sobre sus propios valores y decisiones. A través de esta identificación e introspección, las historias que incorporan dilemas morales pueden resonar profundamente, provocando discusiones y reflexiones mucho tiempo después de que la historia haya concluido."},{"instruction":"Ahora te enviaré la trama de una película y quiero que me digas qué dilemas morales se encuntran en ella, la trama es la siguiente: La trama se sitúa en Nueva York, en octubre de 1999. John Sullivan (Caviezel), un detective de homicidios de 36 años de edad, todavía no supera emocionalmente la muerte de su padre, el bombero Frank Sullivan (Quaid), acontecida treinta años atrás. John vive en la misma casa donde fue criado, así que un día descubre la vieja radio de su radioaficionado padre tras haberse separado de su novia, por lo que decide comunicarse por medio de ella. Debido a una inusual actividad de aurora polar, John descubre que ha logrado hacer contacto con su padre exactamente 30 años atrás en el pasado, poco antes del día en que este último falleciera en el incendio de un inmueble. John logra advertirle a su padre de tal suceso que habría de quitarle la vida, y aunque Frank al principio se muestra escéptico de que John sea su hijo en el futuro, sigue el consejo de John tras haberse dado cuenta de que John describió con todo detalle el resultado del segundo juego de la serie mundial de béisbol de 1969. Después de salvar a su padre del incendio, John crea por accidente una nueva cronología, aunque sigue teniendo paradójicamente los recuerdos del pasado. En la nueva cronología alterada, Frank muere esta vez de cáncer de pulmón debido al tabaquismo, mientras que la madre de John, Julia Sullivan (Elizabeth Mitchell), fallece víctima de un asesino serial. En la cronología original, la madre de John había dejado su empleo como enfermera en un hospital para poder asistir al funeral de Frank; en la nueva serie de eventos, ella continúa en el trabajo y está presente para salvar la vida de un hombre que, más tarde, se revela que en realidad es el \\"asesino de Nightingale\\", quien habría muerto esa misma noche debido a una sobredosis de Benazepril y Benadryl en caso de que Julia no hubiera estado presente. El asesino de Nightingale, en la cronología borrada, había matado solamente a tres enfermeras previo a su fallecimiento. El cadáver de una de las víctimas no se descubriría sino hasta 1999. Debido a que fue salvado por Julia, el asesino es capaz de continuar con sus siniestros homicidios, para finalizar en hasta diez víctimas en total. Para desconcierto de John y su padre, la sexta víctima del asesino es su madre, Julia. Tras intercambiar información de archivos policíacos de 1999 en torno a siete asesinatos aún no resueltos, John y Frank colaboran juntos a través del tiempo para detener al homicida en 1969 y así salvar a Julia. Frank logra evitar la muerte de la primera víctima pero, al tratar de prevenir la siguiente, es atacado por el asesino en el baño de un centro nocturno; ahí pierde su licencia de conducir, la cual traía en su cartera en el momento de la intercepción. Al recuperar la conciencia, Frank acude al apartamento de la mujer que se supone logró rescatar, sólo para descubrir que ya es demasiado tarde y fue asesinada. John concluye que las huellas digitales del homicida se hallan impresas en su cartera; John le pide entonces a su padre que oculte la cartera en un lugar vacío y oculto en la casa donde pueda permanecer escondida por los próximos 30 años. Una vez que Frank la deposita en dicho lugar, aparece repentinamente en 1999, justo en el mismo sitio. John lleva la cartera al laboratorio de criminalística para conocer la identidad del asesino: un exdetective llamado Jack Shepard (Shawn Doyle). No obstante, debido a que la licencia de conducir de Frank fue hallada en la escena del crimen de la última víctima (dejada ahí a propósito por el homicida), Frank se vuelve sospechoso de los asesinatos y es llevado por agentes policíacos para ser interrogado por su amigo (y posterior jefe de John) Satch DeLeon (Andre Braugher). En la estación, Frank es confrontado por Shepard, pero Frank logra evadirlo y escapar de la estación. Más tarde, durante el proceso de búsqueda de evidencias en el apartamento de Shepard, Frank se encuentra con Shepard, quien lo persigue hasta llegar a un corral de ganado. Con Satch convencido de la historia de Frank, debido a su predicción acertada de los resultados de la serie mundial, el primero encuentra a Shepard como el culpable de los asesinatos y Frank es absuelto de toda sospecha tras un enfrentamiento en donde todos consideran que Shepard murió. Sin embargo, John sabe que esto no puede ser verdad pues en la foto familiar de 1999 aún su madre no aparece junto a ellos (es decir, aún está muerta, tras haber sido asesinada por Shepard). Esa noche, mientras ambos conversan por medio de la radio, Shepard irrumpe repentinamente en la casa de los Sullivan, tanto en 1969 como en 1999. Justo cuando Shepard está estrangulando a John en 1999, Frank le vuela la mano al Shepard del pasado con una escopeta. Mientras tanto, en 1999, la mano de Shepard empieza a desaparecer sin motivo alguno; la casa también cambia como si alguien más hubiera vivido ahí todo ese tiempo. De entre las sombras aparece Frank, quien vuelve a dispararle a Shepard, esta vez matándolo. En esta línea del tiempo final, Frank no murió ni en el incendio ni de cáncer, pues le prometió a su hijo que dejaría de fumar para evitar morir así.","output":"La trama que describes ofrece varios dilemas morales complejos e interesantes: 1. **Intervención en el pasado y sus consecuencias no intencionadas:** John advierte a su padre sobre el incendio que lo mataría, creyendo hacer lo correcto salvándolo. Sin embargo, esto altera el futuro de formas inesperadas y trágicas, como la muerte de su madre debido a un asesino serial que en la línea temporal original no habría matado tantas víctimas. Esto plantea el dilema moral sobre si es correcto o no intervenir en el pasado, especialmente si las consecuencias pueden ser impredecibles y posiblemente peores que el evento tratado de evitar. 2. **El bien mayor versus el sufrimiento individual:** Al salvar a Frank del incendio, John indirectamente contribuye a la muerte de su madre y a la de otras víctimas del asesino serial. Esto presenta un dilema clásico entre el bienestar colectivo (salvar a Frank, quien a su vez salva otras vidas como bombero) y el sufrimiento individual que resulta de esas acciones (la muerte de Julia y de las víctimas adicionales del asesino). 3. **La ética de manipular el tiempo para hacer justicia:** John y Frank deciden utilizar su conexión única a través del tiempo para detener al asesino serial en el pasado, esperando evitar así las muertes futuras, incluida la de Julia. Este acto de justicia preventiva plantea preguntas sobre la moralidad y las implicancias éticas de tomar la ley en sus propias manos, especialmente cuando se hace mediante la manipulación de eventos temporales. 4. **Sacrificio personal y desinterés:** Frank enfrenta múltiples situaciones en las que debe actuar para proteger a su familia y a otros, a veces a costa de su bienestar o incluso de su vida. Esto ilustra el dilema moral del sacrificio personal por el bien de los demás, explorando hasta dónde se debe llegar por amor y deber hacia la familia y la sociedad. 5. **La decisión de cambiar el pasado a sabiendas de las posibles repercusiones:** John y Frank, al intentar cambiar eventos específicos del pasado para alterar el futuro, deben enfrentar las consecuencias morales de sus acciones. La pregunta subyacente es si tienen el derecho de jugar a ser dioses con la vida de las personas, cambiando el destino según su voluntad, especialmente cuando cada acción parece traer consecuencias imprevistas. 6. **La responsabilidad moral frente al conocimiento futuro:** La capacidad única de John de comunicarse con el pasado le otorga un poder inmenso, pero también una gran responsabilidad moral. Este dilema explora hasta qué punto esa responsabilidad obliga a uno a actuar para prevenir males futuros, y cómo se sopesa ese deber contra los riesgos de las intervenciones temporales. La película, por tanto, no solo proporciona una trama intrigante y emocionalmente cargada, sino que también invita a reflexionar sobre estos complejos dilemas morales, que no tienen respuestas fáciles ni definitivas."},{"instruction":"Write a extremely annoying advert for IPhone, but a disclaimer says \\",This ad is so annoying you'll want to switch to Android\\"","output":"🎵🎶 \\"Ding, ding, ding-a-ling, hear that iPhone ring! 🎶🎵 HEY YOU!

Проверьте кэширование Если для вашего приложения настроено кэширование, изменения могут не отображаться из-за того, что вам показывается старая кешированная версия страницы. Попробуйте очистить кэш браузера или отключить кэширование на время разработки. # 3. Проверьте шаблоны Убедитесь, что изменения сделаны в правильном шаблоне и что тот шаблон действительно используется. Иногда проблема возникает из-за того, что изменения были внесены в один шаблон, но отображается другой. # 4. Проверьте контекст передаваемый в шаблон Если вы изменяете названия через контекст, передаваемый из представления (view), убедитесь, что представление корректно передает обновленные данные в шаблон. # 5. Проверьте наличие ошибок в коде или консоли Иногда проблемы с отображением могут быть связаны с другими ошибками в коде, которые не напрямую связаны с меню. Проверьте консоль на наличие ошибок. # 6. Проверьте статические файлы Если меню реализовано через статические файлы (CSS или JavaScript), убедитесь, что они корректно подгружаются и актуальная версия файла используется в шаблоне. При необходимости, примените \`collectstatic\` команду после изменений и очистите кэш браузера. # 7. Проверьте конфигурации URL Убедитесь, что изменения не связаны с конфигурацией URL. В Django URL-адреса также могут влиять на то, какие шаблоны и представления используются. Если проблема сохраняется после проверки вышеуказанных пунктов, возможно, стоит более детально изучить логику работы вашего приложения и возможно дополнительно проконсультироваться с документацией Django или сообществом разработчиков."},{"instruction":"там другую кнопку меняю и обновляется а меню не хочет, тема tgcagency","output":"Если проблема возникает конкретно в теме \`tgcagency\` для Django и изменения в кнопке обновляются корректно, но аналогичные изменения в меню нет, это указывает на более специфичную проблему, связанную либо с кэшированием, использованием статичных файлов или же особенностями реализации меню в данной теме. Вот несколько шагов, которые можно предпринять, чтобы попытаться решить данную проблему: # 1. Проверка статических файлов Убедитесь, что после внесения изменений в статические файлы (CSS или JavaScript, отвечающие за стиль и поведение меню) вы выполнили команду: \`\`\`bash python manage.py collectstatic \`\`\` Это обновит статические файлы на вашем сервере. После этого также стоит очистить кэш браузера, чтобы убедиться, что новая версия файлов подгружается корректно. # 2. Проблемы кэширования Если ваш сайт или специфическая тема используют механизмы кэширования (например, Django’s cache framework), попробуйте временно отключить кэширование или очистить кэш. Это можно сделать через Django shell или путем очистки кэша на уровне используемой базы данных или кэш-сервера (Redis, Memcached). # 3. Проверка реализации меню Темы и шаблоны иногда используют специфические подходы к реализации меню, включая использование базы данных или динамической подгрузки содержимого. Попробуйте изучить, как именно реализовано меню в используемой вами теме \`tgcagency\`, и удостовериться, что изменения вносятся в правильное место. Возможно, потребуется изменить какой-то конкретный шаблон или файл конфигурации темы. # 4. Проверка документации и поддержки темы Поскольку вопрос касается конкретной темы, стоит также проверить её документацию или обратиться за помощью к разработчикам темы. Возможно, есть какие-то особенности или известные проблемы, связанные именно с меню. # 5. Перепроверьте ваш код Если другие элементы интерфейса (например, кнопка, о которой вы упомянули) обновляются без проблем, проверьте различия в вашем коде между реализацией кнопки и меню. Возможно, при внесении изменений была допущена опечатка или ошибки в логике генерации меню. Обращение к сообществу разработчиков Django или специализированным форумам с конкретными фрагментами кода, которые вы пытаетесь изменить, также может быть полезным для нахождения решения вашей проблемы."},{"instruction":"как сделать атк чтобы джанго чистил кеш каждую минуту","output":"Для того чтобы реализовать автоматическую очистку кеша в Django каждую минуту, вы можете использовать несколько подходов. Один из наиболее распространенных – использование планировщика задач, такого как Celery, вместе с Django. Вот базовые шаги, чтобы настроить это: # Шаг 1: Установка Celery Для начала убедитесь, что у вас установлены Celery и Redis (или другой брокер сообщений) в вашем проекте: \`\`\`bash pip install celery redis \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Настройка Celery Добавьте базовую конфигурацию Celery в ваш проект Django. Для этого создайте файл \`celery.py\` в главном каталоге вашего проекта (на одном уровне с \`settings.py\`): \`\`\`python # celery.py from __future__ import absolute_import, unicode_literals import os from celery import Celery # Указываем дефолтные настройки Django для Celery. os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings') app = Celery('your_project_name') # Загрузка настроек Celery из настроек Django. app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY') # Автообнаружение задач из зарегистрированных приложений Django. app.autodiscover_tasks() @app.task(bind=True) def debug_task(self): print(f'Request: {self.request!r}') \`\`\` Не забудьте заменить \`'your_project_name'\` на название вашего проекта. # Шаг 3: Настройка Django Дополните ваш \`settings.py\`, добавив конфигурацию брокера сообщений, например Redis: \`\`\`python CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0' \`\`\` # Шаг 4: Создание задачи Celery для очистки кеша Создайте файл task.py в одном из ваших приложений, или где вам угодно, и определите в нем задачу для очистки кеша: \`\`\`python # tasks.py from celery import shared_task from django.core.cache import cache @shared_task def clear_cache(): cache.clear() print(\\"Cache cleared!\\") \`\`\` # Шаг 5: Настройка периодической задачи Теперь, используя Celery Beat, настройте задачу так, чтобы она выполнялась каждую минуту. Для этого добавьте следующую конфигурацию в ваш \`settings.py\`: \`\`\`python from celery.schedules import crontab CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = { 'clear-cache-every-minute': { 'task': 'your_app_name.tasks.clear_cache', 'schedule': crontab(minute='*'), }, } \`\`\` Замените \`'your_app_name.tasks.clear_cache'\` на фактический путь к вашей задаче. # Шаг 6: Запуск Celery и Celery Beat Теперь вы готовы запустить Celery worker и Celery Beat для выполнения задачи: \`\`\`bash celery -A your_project_name worker --loglevel=info \`\`\` И в другом терминале: \`\`\`bash celery -A your_project_name beat --loglevel=info \`\`\` Убедитесь, что замените \`your_project_name\` на имя вашего проекта. Эти команды запустят Celery worker и Celery Beat, которые будут выполнять задачу очистки кеша каждую минуту. Этот подход использует Celery для планирования периодических задач, что является стандартом де-факто для выполняемых задач и фоновых процессов в проектах Django."},{"instruction":"как установить torchbox wagtail на laragon пошагово стартер кит который","output":"Установка Wagtail, CMS на основе Django, на локальной машине с использованием Laragon в Windows включает в себя несколько шагов.

One main reason to consider increasing the thickness of the filter layer includes: **Safety and Durability**: - **Tolerance for Variability**: Natural materials used in construction, like the stones for the filter layer, exhibit variability in size, shape, and other properties. A thicker layer accommodates this variability better, ensuring the effectiveness of the filter over its entire area. - **Wave Action and Erosion**: Breakwaters are subjected to powerful wave action and potential erosion, which can compromise thinner filter layers faster. A thicker layer offers better resilience against wave action, providing longer-lasting protection. - **Settlement and Compaction**: Over time, materials within the breakwater, including the filter layer, might settle or compact under their own weight and the weight of overlying materials. A thicker initial layer ensures that even after some settlement, adequate filtration and structural integrity are maintained. - **Safety Factor**: In engineering, including additional thickness can serve as part of a safety factor to account for uncertainties in design conditions, unexpected environmental changes, or possible calculation errors. This ensures that the structure remains functional under unforeseen circumstances. - **Construction and Material Handling**: During construction, achieving the exact calculated thickness might be challenging due to equipment limitations or human error. A slightly thicker design is more forgiving during the construction phase, ensuring the final construction still meets or exceeds design requirements. By rounding up the thickness, you are essentially adding a layer of precaution that accounts for real-world challenges and uncertainties, ensuring that the breakwater performs its intended function over its expected lifespan without needing premature maintenance or repairs."},{"instruction":"Write a story, set in an alternate version of the Zootopia universe, about Officer Duke Weaselton of the Zootopia Police Department arresting the notorious Bonnie and Clyde-esque criminal duo of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde. Suddenly, things take an awkward turn when an interdimensional portal inexplicably appears, causing Officers Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde of the ZPD and Duke Weaselton the notorious crook from the actual Zootopia universe to appear. Both versions of Judy, Nick, and Duke awkwardly end up staring at eachother, and comment on the strange role-reversal between parallel universes.","output":"In an alternate timeline of the Zootopia universe, where the lines between right and wrong blur into shades of gray, Officer Duke Weaselton patrolled the neon-lit streets with a keen eye and an iron resolve. Gone was the small-time crook known for his petty thefts; in his place stood a determined officer of the Zootopia Police Department. Despite his size, Duke had proven himself a formidable force against crime, weaving through the urban jungle with unmatched agility and cunning. On this particularly chilly evening, his focus narrowed on capturing the most elusive and notorious criminal duo Zootopia had ever known—Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde. Not the heroes of the city as one might expect, but its most cunning outlaws, their Bonnie and Clyde-esque escapades had left the police force in a constant state of frustration and admiration. Where the original universe painted them as symbols of hope and unity, in this reality, they were the epitome of charming rebellion and unparalleled thievery. As Duke staked out their latest rumored hideout, an old warehouse on the outskirts of the Rainforest District, his keen ears caught the whisper of movement. Without hesitation, he darted forward, bursting through the door to find Judy and Nick, bags of loot at their feet, just as surprised to see him. \\"End of the line, Hopps and Wilde,\\" Duke declared, his voice steady despite his pounding heart. However, before any of them could move, the air shimmered, and a glowing, swirling vortex ripped open the fabric of reality itself right in the middle of the standoff. Against all logic and reason, another Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, along with a very disoriented looking Duke Weaselton, tumbled out of the portal. These newcomers, directly from the universe we know, were the spitting image of their counterparts, except their moral compasses pointed in entirely opposite directions. Silence engulfed the room as both trios stared at each other, the absurdity of the situation momentarily paralyzing them. It was the ZPD Judy who broke the silence, her voice a mix of disbelief and curiosity. \\"Nick, are we...are we the bad guys here?\\" Nick, equally taken aback, could only chuckle nervously. \\"Looks like it, Carrots. In another world, we're the rogues. And Duke,\\" he nodded towards the officer Duke, \\"is the good guy. Who would've thought?\\" Duke, the criminal, recovering from his initial shock, crossed his arms, an amused smirk playing on his lips. \\"Well, well, well. Officer Weaselton, huh? Never thought I'd see the day. And here I thought I had seen it all.\\" Officer Duke, still trying to wrap his mind around the interdimensional guests, adjusted his badge awkwardly. \\"It seems our roles are quite reversed. In your universe, I'm the one breaking the law? Fascinating.\\" The standoff, now turned into an awkward meeting, took an even stranger turn as both sets of Judy and Nick began to share stories of their experiences, their struggles, and their victories. Officer Judy and Nick listened intently, gaining insight into how circumstances could have led them down a very different path. Meanwhile, criminal Judy and Nick began to see the value in the work their alternate selves were doing, perhaps wondering what might have been. As the conversation wore on, a sense of mutual respect developed among the group. Despite their vastly different lives, they were, in many ways, reflections of each other, shaped by the choices they'd made and the worlds they inhabited. In time, the interdimensional portal flickered once more, signaling that it was time for Judy, Nick, and Duke of the ZPD universe to return. Before stepping through, Officer Judy turned to her counterpart, a determined glint in her eye. \\"Maybe there's still time to change things,\\" she suggested. \\"To make different choices. After all, if we could end up where you are, who's to say you can't find a way to where we are?\\" With a final wave, the trio stepped back into the vortex, leaving their counterparts in silent contemplation. In the silence that followed, criminal Judy and Nick exchanged a glance, an unspoken agreement passing between them. Maybe, just maybe, it was time for a new beginning. And as they watched the portal close, leaving no trace behind, Officer Duke Weaselton couldn't help but smile. For in the most unexpected way, he'd helped plant the seed of change in another universe—a mirror reflection that, against all odds, had offered them all a glimpse of what could be. In the sprawling, complex city of Zootopia, where endless possibilities stretched beneath its glittering skyline, the story of two Judys, two Nicks, and two Dukes served as a reminder that no matter the universe, change was always within reach."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[크면서 얼굴은 열두 번 변한다던데, 지희도 그럴까?] 내 손을 잡은 지희의 손에 힘이 꽉 들어갔다. “오빠, 어서!” “그럼, 지희야. 오빠 씻고 갈게.” “응. 그럼, 지희는 안 자고 기다릴게.” “알았어!” 물을 마신 지희는 뚜벅뚜벅 방으로 걸어갔다. 마침 아빠가 욕실에서 나왔다. 아빠는 머리를 수건으로 탈탈 털면서 방안을 슬쩍 들여다봤다. “성국아, 다른 방 또 있지?” “아빠, 지희가 다 같이 한방에 모여서 자자고 하는데요.” “성국아, 우리 오랜만에 그럴까? 옛날 생각도 나겠네.” [옛날 생각이라… 아빠, 단칸방 생활 기억하는 건 나밖에 없다고… 진짜 나 엄청 예민했는데, 그때 많이 참았어. 아빠 코 고는 소리 장난 아니었다고!] 아빠는 신이 나서 머리를 말리더니 지희가 들어간 방으로 갔다. “성국아, 어서 씻고 와.” “응.” * * * 나는 샤워를 한 후 밖으로 나와서 짧은 머리를 말리면서 우리 가족이 모두 잠든 방 안을 바라봤다. 큰 침대 위에는 엄마와 민국이 그리고 지희가 잠들어 있었다. 다들 엄마를 꼭 안은 채였다. [지희 녀석, 안 자고 기다리겠다더니.] 그리고 바닥에는 아빠가 이불을 깔고 누워 있었다. 나를 발견한 아빠가 손짓을 했다. “성국아, 너랑 나랑은 여기서 자자.” “응, 아빠.” 나는 머리를 대충 말리고 방 안으로 들어가서, 아빠가 미리 마련해둔 바닥에 자리를 잡았다. 아빠는 나를 대견하게 쳐다봤다. [아빠, 시선 부담스러워,] “성국아, 이렇게 누워보는 거 너무 오랜만이다. 그치?” [아빠, 지금 말도 부담스러워.] 나는 괜히 말을 돌렸다. “아빠, 안 피곤해? 오늘 비행기도 오래 탔는데, 오자마자 음식 준비했잖아.” “성국아, 아빠 아직 젊어.” [알아, 아빠 아직 새파랗게 어린 30대잖아. 난 나이 마흔에 죽었었다고.] 내가 아무 말을 하지 않자, 아빠는 조용히 깊은숨을 뱉었다. “성국아, 아빠가 정말 삼십대에 이런 인생이 펼쳐질 줄은 상상도 못 했어.” [하아, 아빠 사연팔이 또 시작인가… 오랜만이니 들어줘야지.] 아빠는 계속 말을 이었다. “고아원에서 막 독립할 때 돈 얼마 주거든. 그걸로 작은 고시원에 들어갔는데… 식당에서 같이 일하던 동료가 돈 좀 급히 빌려달라고 해서 그 돈을 빌려줬어. 근데… 그 동료가 돈 갚는다고 그러고는 다음 날 식당도 안 나오고 잠수 타버린 거 있지.” 나는 잠시 뒤척였다. [오호, 이건 새로운 사연팔이네.] 아빠는 멈추지 않고 이야기를 계속 했다. “그때, 정말 고시원 월세 빼고 다 빌려준 거라 일하는 식당에서 먹는 밥 한 끼 빼고는 한 달 내내 굶다시피 했어. 하아- 성국아. 아빠 말이야. 그때 진짜 앞날이 캄캄했어.” [지금 아빠는 가게도 있고, 집도 있고, 돈도 벌었잖아!] 나는 다시 한번 뒤척였다. “그땐 외국 같은 데 나갈 수 있을 거라고는 생각도 못했는데…” 순간, 아빠에게로 쿠션이 날아왔다. 그리고 엄마의 목소리가 들렸다. “자기야, 애들 다 자잖아. 맨날 성국이 붙잡고 사연팔이 좀 그만해. 성국이 잠도 못 자잖아!” “그게 아니라….” “아니긴 뭐가 아니야! 자기야, 어서 자. 성국아, 너도 피곤할 텐데 어서 자.” “응, 엄마.” [아빠, 미안하지만 역시 엄마가 최고야!] 나는 곧 눈을 감았다. 아빠는 몇 번 뒤척이더니 곧 요란하게 코를 골았다. 다들 오랜 비행에 피곤했는지 숨소리가 거칠었다. 나는 오랜만에 가족들의 숨소리를 들으며 잠이 들었다. 그리고 정말 행복한 하루의 마무리였다. * * * “형아! 내 댓글 좀 읽어줘!” 민국이가 아침부터 요란하게 노트북을 들고 달려왔다. 보나 마나 부모님께 자신의 너튜브를 자랑하고픈 마음인 것 같았다. “형아, 내 동영상에 댓글 엄청 달렸어. 그치?” 민국이의 말대로 동영상에는 댓글들이 엄청 달렸다. 베타 서비스이기 때문에 영어로 달린 댓글들이었다. - 민국이! 춤선이 예사롭지 않아. 아직 기본기는 부족하지만 저 정도면 좀만 갈고 닦으면 좋은 춤꾼이 될 거야! - 와, 대박! 저 형제 유전자 내가 다 부러워해도 되는 거야? 대부분은 민국이를 응원하는 댓글이었다. 그때 눈에 띄는 댓글이 하나 있었다. - 나는 가수들의 연예 기획자인 스캇 브라운이라고 합니다. 제 연락처예요. 관심 있으면… 아니 제발, 연락주세요! 민국이의 재능이 너무 탐나네요! 스캇 브라운이라고? 혹시 내가 아는 그 스캇 브라운인가? 저스트 비버를 너튜브에서 발견해서 키운 그 연예 기획자? 나는 잠시 턱을 매만졌다. 민국이가 옆에서 날뛰기 시작했다. “형아! 왜 댓글 안 읽어줘?” “어… 다들 민국이 춤에 반했다고 해.” “형아, 이번에는 제대로 노래하는 동영상 좀 올려야겠어. 형아, 이 사람 나 만나고 싶다는 거 아니야?” “어….” 민국이는 더듬더듬 스캇 브라운이 남긴 댓글을 읽었다. “형아, 이 사람 뭐 하는 사람이야?” “연예 기획자라고 하는데….” “형아! 그럼, 나 이 사람이 캐스팅하는 거야?” “그건 아직 모르는 거야.” “형아, 이 사람 만나보고 싶어! 어? 나, 이러다가 미국에서 가수 데뷔하는 거 아니야?” “흠….” 미국의 연예계 시스템은 잘은 모르지만, 그렇게 쉬운 문제는 아니었다. 거기다 이건 내가 생각한 민국이의 미래랑은 좀 달랐다. 나는 방무혁과 함께 민국이를 대한민국 최고의 아이돌 그룹이자, 세계 최고의 아이돌 그룹으로 만들 생각이었다. 민국이가 옆에서 졸라대기 시작했다. “형아! 형아! 형아! 제발! 만나자! 만나자고 해봐!” “민국아, 사기꾼일 수도 있어.” 이름만으로 진짜 스캇 브라운인지 확인이 안 되는 상황이었다. “사기꾼이든 아니든 만나봐야 아는 거잖아!” [이건 민국이 말이 맞는데….] 나는 어쩔 수 없이 고개를 끄덕였다. “연락해볼게. 하지만 크게 기대는 하지 마. 한번 해본 말일 수도 있어.” “응! 형아!” 민국이는 크게 고개를 끄덕였다. 우선 나는 댓글을 단 스캇 브라운이 남긴 메일로 만나고 싶다는 의사를 전달했다. 하지만 뭔가 영 석연치 않았다. * * * 띵동. 나는 처음으로 전태국 숙소의 초인종을 눌렀다. 곧 전태국이 부스스한 얼굴로 나왔다. “성국아, 아침부터 무슨 일이야?” “태국이 형, 저 부탁이 있어서요.” “부탁? 진짜? 나한테 하는 거 맞자?” “네….” 나는 단호하게 고개를 끄덕였다. 전태국이 의외라는 얼굴로 들어오란 손짓을 했다. “들어와서 얘기하자.” 숙소 안에서는 젊은 양 비서가 한창 아침 준비 중이었다. “양 비서가 아침 준비 중인데, 먹고 갈래?” “아니에요. 아빠가 아침 하고 계세요.” “흠… 맛있겠는데. 혹시 나도 가서 먹어도 돼?” “대신 제 부탁 좀 들어주세요.” “겨우 아침밥 대가로 부탁 들어달라는 거야?” “저희 아버지 요리 솜씨 아시잖아요. 지금 어제 마신 술 때문에 북어국 끓이고 계시거든요.” 전태국은 얼른 젊은 양 비서에게 소리쳤다. “양 비서, 아침 하지 마. 커피만 한 잔 줘. 성국이네 가서 아침 먹게.” “아, 네. 알겠습니다.” 젊은 양 비서는 커피를 내리기 시작했다. 전태국은 팔짱을 끼고 나를 쳐다봤다. “그래, 아침부터 날 찾은 이유가 뭐야?” “민국이 동영상에 스캇 브라운이라는 미국의 연예 기획자가 댓글을 달았어요. 한번 만나고 싶다고요. 민국이의 재능이 탐난다는 말을 덧붙이긴 했어요.” “흠… 그 사람 보는 눈은 좀 있네. 나도 민국이에게 투표했잖아!” 전태국은 고개를 끄덕였다. “근데 혹시나 사기꾼이거나 나쁜 사람일 수도 있잖아요. 민국이는 만나고 싶어 하는데, 혹시 몰라서요.” “흠… 그러니까 삼전 그룹 차원에서 그 사람 검증 좀 해달라는 거지?” [전태국, 이런 눈치는 좀 빠른데?] “네… 검증뿐 아니라 철수 형이든 누구든 같이 나가주셨으면 해서요. 아무래도 제가 연예계 쪽은 잘 모르고, 저나 민국이나 아직은 미성년자잖아요.” “내가 같이 나가줄게.” 의외의 대답이었다. “형이 같이 나가주신다고요?” “응. 나 연예계 쪽에 관심 많거든.” 저번 생에서도 전태국은 연예계 쪽에 관심이 많았다. 물론 여자 때문이었지만. [마다할 이유는 없어 보이는데….] 삼전 그룹 차원에서 검증해주고, 더군다나 삼전 그룹의 후계자인 전태국이 같이 나가준다는 것만으로도 든든했다. “태국이 형, 그렇게 해주세요.” 나는 전태국에게 저번 생과 이번 생을 통틀어 처음으로 부탁이라는 것을 했다. 동생 때문에. * * * 문이 닫히고 전태국은 젊은 양 비서를 불러서 성국이가 건넨 연예 기획자의 이름과 메일을 건넸다. “양 비서, 비서실 통해서 이 사람 조사해서 알려줘.” “네, 도련님.” 젊은 양 비서는 고개를 끄덕였다. 전태국은 커피를 한 모금 마셨다. “양 비서, 좀 이상해.” “뭐가요, 도련님?” “그냥 성국이 가족들은 뭔가 친근하다고나 할까. 분명 처음에는 나를 좋아하는 것 같지 않았는데, 성국이랑 민국이도 그렇고… 뭔가 남 같지가 않아.” “도련님이 타지에서 혼자 오래 지내셔서 그런 거 아닐까요? 성국이나 민국이가 좋은 친구들이기도 하고요.” “그런가….” “참, 아버님이 다음 주에 샌프란시스코에 도착하신다고 합니다.” 전태국은 조금 긴장을 했다. “벌써 다음 주야?” “프리젠테이션 준비 시작하셔야죠.” “흠… 우선 성국이네 가서 아침 좀 먹고. 어제 술 마셨더니 북엇국 엄청 땡겨.” 전태국은 해야 할 일을 미루고 자리에서 일어났다. * * * 전태국이 거들먹거리며 종이 한 장을 내밀었다. “성국아, 네가 알아봐 달라는 사람 조사한 거야. 우리 비서팀에서….” “감사해요, 형.” “이렇게 간단한 걸 뭘.” 나는 얼른 전태국이 내민 조사 내용을 살폈다. 내가 기억하는 스캇 브라운이 분명했다. “슬쩍 보니까 꽤 괜찮은 연예 기획자 같던데. 만날 거야?” “네, 한번 만나보려고요.” “민국이 녀석 재능이 있나 봐. 미국에서 그런 사람의 연락이 다 오고….” “그건가 봐요.” 나는 은근히 미소를 지었다. 스캇 브라운의 실체도 확인했으니, 이제부터는 슬슬 움직여볼 때였다. 나는 얼른 방무혁의 메일로 민국이의 동영상과 함께 너튜브 링크를 보냈다. 그리고 이런 내용을 적었다. - 무혁 아저씨, 저 성국이에요. 잘 지내시죠? 혹시 제 동생 민국이 기억하세요? 민국이가 미국에 잠시 어학연수를 왔다가 너튜브라는 동영상 사이트에 노래하고 춤추는 동영상을 올렸는데. 스캇 브라운이라는 사람이 연락이 왔어요. 알아보니 꽤 유명한 연예 기획자라고 하는데요. 제가 이 분야는 잘 몰라서요. 그리고 민국이가 진짜 재능이 있는지도 모르겠어요. 아저씨가 한번 보고 판단 부탁드려요. 나는 그대로 메일을 전송했다. 지금 나는 방무혁을 테스트하는 것이었다. 방무혁이 진짜를 알아볼 수 있는 눈을 가지고 있는지 없는지를.","output":"Episode 160 Clatter. Clatter. I finished the dishes and turned off the faucet. Suddenly, someone hugged me from behind, burying their face in my thigh. I felt like I knew who it was without having to look back. “Brother… Brother, why aren’t you sleeping?” Jihee was holding onto my thigh, rubbing her sleepy eyes. “Jihee, did you wake up?” “Yeah. Brother, I want water.” “Just a moment.” I quickly poured some water and handed it to Jihee. Jihee gulped down the water. “Ah-” After refreshing herself, Jihee handed me the cup. “Brother, the cup.” “Yeah.” After handing me the cup, Jihee suddenly grabbed my hand. “Jihee, what’s wrong?” “Brother, let’s all sleep together tonight. With mom, dad, and Minkook brother. Okay?” Jihee looked up at me with her round eyes. I thought all the genes in our family had gone awry, but Jihee’s eyes had grown quite big. [I heard faces change twelve times as they grow, will Jihee change too?] Jihee’s grip on my hand tightened. “Brother, hurry!” “Then, Jihee. I’ll go wash up and come.” “Okay. Then, I’ll wait without sleeping.” “Got it!” After drinking the water, Jihee walked back to her room. Dad just came out of the bathroom. He shook his head with a towel and peeked into the room. “Sungkook, we have other rooms, don’t we?” “Dad, Jihee wants us all to sleep together in one room.” “Sungkook, shall we do that for a change? It reminds me of the old days.” [Old days… Dad, I’m the only one who remembers our cramped room life… I was really sensitive back then, but I endured a lot. Dad’s snoring was no joke!] Dad, excited, dried his hair and went into the room Jihee entered. “Sungkook, come after you wash up.” “Yeah.” * * * After showering, I came out and looked into the room where my family was sleeping, drying my short hair. On the big bed, mom, Minkook, and Jihee were asleep. They were all hugging mom tightly. [Jihee, you said you’d wait without sleeping.] And on the floor, dad had laid down a blanket and was lying on it. Dad gestured to me when he saw me. “Sungkook, you and I will sleep here.” “Okay, dad.” I quickly dried my hair and went into the room, taking my place on the floor dad had prepared. Dad looked at me proudly. [Dad, your gaze is making me uncomfortable,] “Sungkook, it’s been so long since we’ve laid down like this together, hasn’t it?” [Dad, even talking feels burdensome now.] I changed the subject. “Dad, aren’t you tired? You took a long flight today, and you started cooking right away.” “Sungkook, dad is still young.” [I know, dad, you’re still in your youthful thirties. I died at forty.] As I remained silent, dad let out a deep sigh. “Sungkook, dad never imagined life would unfold like this in his thirties.” [Oh, dad’s starting his story again… I guess I should listen since it’s been a while.] Dad continued talking. “When I first became independent from the orphanage, they gave me a little money. I moved into a small goshiwon with that… A colleague from the restaurant I worked at asked to borrow some money urgently, so I lent it to him. But… he said he’d pay me back and then disappeared the next day, not showing up at the restaurant.” I shifted slightly. [Oh, this is a new story.] Dad didn’t stop and kept talking. “At that time, I had lent him almost all my money except for the goshiwon rent, so I practically starved for a month except for the meals at the restaurant. Ah- Sungkook. Dad was really in despair back then.” [Now, dad has a store, a house, and he’s making money!] I shifted again. “I never thought I’d be able to go abroad back then…” Suddenly, a cushion flew towards dad, and mom’s voice was heard. “Honey, the kids are asleep. Stop telling your stories to Sungkook. He can’t even sleep!” “That’s not it…” “What do you mean it’s not! Honey, let’s sleep. Sungkook, you must be tired too, go to sleep.” “Okay, mom.” [Dad, sorry, but mom is the best!] I soon closed my eyes. Dad tossed and turned a few times before soon snoring loudly. Everyone was tired from the long flight, and their breathing was heavy. I fell asleep to the sound of my family’s breathing for the first time in a while. And it was truly a happy end to the day. * * * “Brother! Read my comments!” Minkook ran to me with his laptop early in the morning. It seemed like he wanted to show off his YouTube to our parents. “Brother, my video got so many comments. Right?” As Minkook said, the video was filled with comments. Since it was a beta service, the comments were in English. - Minkook! Your dance lines are extraordinary. You still lack the basics, but with a bit more polishing, you’ll become a great dancer! - Wow, amazing! Can I be jealous of those sibling genes? Most of the comments were encouraging for Minkook. Then, one comment caught my eye. - I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, a talent manager for singers. Here’s my contact. If interested… please, contact me! I’m really interested in Minkook’s talent! Scott Brown? Could it be the Scott Brown I know? The talent manager who discovered Justin Bieber on YouTube? I pondered for a moment. Minkook started to get excited. “Brother! Why aren’t you reading the comments?” “Uh… everyone is impressed with your dance.” “Brother, I should upload a video of me singing properly this time. Brother, this person wants to meet me, right?” “Uh…” Minkook stuttered as he read Scott Brown’s comment. “Brother, who is this person?” “A talent manager, it seems…” “Brother! Then, am I being scouted?” “That’s not certain yet.” “Brother, I want to meet this person! Huh? Am I going to debut as a singer in the US?” “Hmm…” I wasn’t sure about the American entertainment industry system, but it wasn’t a simple matter. Moreover, this was different from the future I had envisioned for Minkook. I planned to make Minkook the top idol group in South Korea and the world with Bang Muhyuk. Minkook started to nag. “Brother! Brother! Brother! Please! Let’s meet! Let’s say we’ll meet!” “Minkook, it could be a scam.” We couldn’t confirm if it was really Scott Brown just by the name. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a scam or not, we won’t know until we meet!” [He has a point…] I reluctantly nodded. “I’ll contact him. But don’t get your hopes up too high. It might just be talk.” “Okay! Brother!” Minkook nodded vigorously. For now, I sent an email to Scott Brown, who left a comment, expressing our interest in meeting. But something felt off. * * * Ding-dong. I pressed the doorbell of Jeon Taeguk’s residence for the first time. Soon, Jeon Taeguk appeared with a disheveled face. “Sungkook, what brings you here so early?” “Taeguk hyung, I have a favor to ask.” “A favor? Really? To me?” “Yes…” I nodded firmly. Jeon Taeguk looked surprised and gestured for me to come in. “Come in and talk.” Inside, the young secretary Yang was busy preparing breakfast. “Yang Secretary is preparing breakfast, want to eat here?” “No, my dad is making breakfast.” “Hmm… sounds delicious. Can I come eat too?” “Only if you do me this favor.” “You want breakfast in exchange for a favor?” “You know my dad’s cooking skills. He’s making dried pollack soup because of the hangover from yesterday.” Jeon Taeguk quickly shouted to the young secretary Yang. “Yang Secretary, stop the breakfast. Just make me a cup of coffee. I’ll eat at Sungkook’s.” “Ah, yes. Understood.” Young secretary Yang started making coffee. Jeon Taeguk crossed his arms and looked at me. “So, what brings you here so early?” “Minkook’s video got a comment from Scott Brown, a talent manager from the US. He said he wants to meet. He added that he’s really interested in Minkook’s talent.” “Hmm… That person has an eye for talent. I voted for Minkook too!” Jeon Taeguk nodded. “But what if he’s a scammer or a bad person? Minkook wants to meet him, but just in case…” “Hmm… So you want the Samjeon Group to check this person out?” [Jeon Taeguk, you catch on fast?] “Yes… Not just verification, but I was hoping someone like Cheolsu hyung could accompany us. I don’t know much about the entertainment industry, and both Minkook and I are still minors.” “I’ll go with you.” An unexpected answer. “You’ll go with us?” “Yeah. I’m quite interested in the entertainment industry.” In my previous life, Jeon Taeguk had a lot of interest in the entertainment industry. Of course, it was because of women. [There seems to be no reason to refuse…] Having the Samjeon Group verify it and having Jeon Taeguk, the heir of the Samjeon Group, accompany us felt reassuring. “Taeguk hyung, please do that.” For the first time in both my past and present life, I asked Jeon Taeguk for a favor. For my brother’s sake. * * * After the door closed, Jeon Taeguk called young secretary Yang and handed over the talent manager’s name and email that Sungkook had given him. “Yang Secretary, have our secretarial team investigate this person and let me know.” “Yes, Young Master.” Young secretary Yang nodded. Jeon Taeguk took a sip of his coffee. “Yang Secretary, it’s strange.” “What is, Young Master?” “Just, Sungkook’s family feels familiar somehow. At first, it seemed like they didn’t like me much, but Sungkook and Minkook… they don’t feel like strangers.” “Maybe it’s because you’ve been alone abroad for so long, Young Master. Sungkook and Minkook are good friends too.” “Maybe…” “By the way, your father will arrive in San Francisco next week.” Jeon Taeguk tensed up a bit. “Already next week?” “You should start preparing for the presentation.” “Hmm… First, let’s go eat breakfast at Sungkook’s. I’m craving dried pollack soup after drinking yesterday.” Jeon Taeguk postponed his work and stood up. * * * Jeon Taeguk swaggered and handed me a piece of paper. “Sungkook, here’s the investigation result on the person you asked about. Our secretarial team did it…” “Thank you, hyung.” “It’s nothing.” I quickly looked over the investigation results Jeon Taeguk handed me. It was definitely the Scott Brown I remembered. “Looks like a decent talent manager at a glance. Going to meet him?” “Yes, I’ll try meeting him.” “Minkook must have talent if such a person from the US is contacting him…” “Seems so.” I smiled subtly. Now that Scott Brown’s identity was confirmed, it was time to start moving. I quickly sent an email to Bang Muhyuk with Minkook’s video and the YouTube link. And I wrote this: - Muhyuk uncle, it’s Sungkook. How have you been? Do you remember my brother Minkook? Minkook uploaded a video of him singing and dancing on a site called YouTube while on a language course in the US. Scott Brown contacted us. Upon checking, he seems to be a well-known talent manager. I’m not familiar with this field, and I’m not sure if Minkook really has talent. Could you take a look and give your opinion? I sent the email as is. Now, I was testing Bang Muhyuk. To see if he had the eye to recognize real talent."},{"instruction":"In assessing a oral temperature in a 20-year-old male patient, which of the following could result in the least accurate reading? give me options for this multiple question make one correct","output":"A.

Correct answer: B) The thermometer was placed on the patient's forehead instead of under the tongue."},{"instruction":"what is the correct answer and why","output":"The correct answer is: B) The thermometer was placed on the patient's forehead instead of under the tongue. Placing the thermometer on the patient's forehead instead of under the tongue can result in a less accurate reading because forehead temperatures can be influenced by external factors such as the environment and skin surface temperature. The most accurate oral temperature reading is obtained by placing the thermometer correctly under the tongue, where it can measure the internal body temperature more accurately."},{"instruction":"Q5: In assessing an oral temperature in a 20-year-old male patient, which of the following could result in the least accurate reading? A) The patient just finished a hot beverage. B) The thermometer probe covers with a A plastic probe C) The patient just exercised vigorously before having their temperature taken. D) The room temperature is extremely cold","output":"The correct answer is B) The thermometer probe covers with a plastic probe.

It is important to ensure that the thermometer is used without any obstruction for the most accurate temperature assessment."},{"instruction":"How about having hot drink","output":"If the patient just finished a hot beverage, this could potentially elevate their oral temperature temporarily and lead to a slightly higher reading. However, this would not necessarily result in the least accurate reading as the increased temperature from the hot drink would likely dissipate relatively quickly. Placing a plastic probe cover on the thermometer could have a more significant impact on the accuracy of the temperature reading because it can interfere with the heat transfer between the patient's mouth and the thermometer, leading to a potentially less accurate measurement.

The bladder of the cuff should encircle at least 80% of the arm. 3. **Proper Placement**: Place the cuff on the bare skin of the upper arm, slightly above the elbow. The bottom of the cuff should be about 2.5 cm above the elbow crease. 4. **Position the Stethoscope**: Locate the brachial artery pulse on the inside of the elbow and place your stethoscope's diaphragm over this area. 5. **Inflate the Cuff**: Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb until the pressure exceeds the expected systolic pressure. 6. **Slowly Deflate the Cuff**: Release the air valve slowly, about 2-3 mmHg per heartbeat, and listen for the first sound (systolic pressure) and the point where the sound disappears (diastolic pressure). 7. **Note the Readings**: Record the systolic pressure (when the first sound is heard) and diastolic pressure (when the sound disappears) in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). 8. **Repeat if Necessary**: If the first reading is high, wait a few minutes and reassess. Take multiple readings to ensure accuracy. 9. **Record the Data**: Document the measurements, including the date, time, and arm used, in the patient's records. 10. **Provide Feedback**: Share the results with the individual and recommend further action if needed, such as lifestyle changes or medical consultation.

Originalmente, la frase se utilizó en el contexto de productos o mercancías que han sufrido algún tipo de daño, lo que disminuye su valor o utilidad. Sin embargo, cuando se aplica a personas, adquiere una connotación muy desfavorable y ofensiva. En el contexto que describes, referirse a una mujer que se ha divorciado dos veces antes de los 30 años como \\"damaged goods\\" implica un juicio de valor muy negativo sobre ella basado en su historial matrimonial. Sugeriría que, debido a sus divorcios, ella es de alguna manera menos valiosa, deseable o adecuada como pareja, lo cual es una perspectiva injusta y despectiva. Es importante recordar que el valor de una persona no se determina por su historial de relaciones pasadas, su estado civil, o cualquier otra circunstancia personal. Tal lenguaje puede ser profundamente dañino y perpetúa estigmas que no tienen lugar en una sociedad que busca ser inclusiva, comprensiva y respetuosa hacia todos los individuos, independientemente de sus experiencias de vida."},{"instruction":"que quiere decir hookup culture","output":"La \\"hookup culture\\" (cultura de las relaciones casuales) se refiere a una tendencia social que acepta y fomenta encuentros sexuales sin compromiso, como las aventuras de una noche o el sexo casual entre personas que no buscan una relación romántica o de largo plazo entre sí. Esta cultura está asociada frecuentemente con las generaciones más jóvenes, especialmente con los estudiantes universitarios y adultos jóvenes, aunque no se limita exclusivamente a ellos. Los aspectos característicos de la cultura de las relaciones casuales incluyen: 1. **Desvinculación emocional:** La interacción sexual no presupone una conexión emocional o compromiso a largo plazo entre los participantes. 2. **Aceptación social:** Hay un mayor grado de aceptación social hacia las relaciones sexuales casuales y las experiencias de una noche, en comparación con épocas anteriores. 3. **La tecnología como facilitador:** Las aplicaciones de citas y redes sociales han jugado un papel importante en la facilidad de encontrar parejas sexuales casualmente, permitiendo a los usuarios conectarse con otros que buscan el mismo tipo de interacciones. 4. **Cambio en las normas sexuales:** Refleja una evolución en las normas y actitudes sexuales, donde se valora más la libertad individual y la experimentación. Sin embargo, la \\"hookup culture\\" también ha sido objeto de críticas y análisis, especialmente en lo que respecta a sus implicaciones en el bienestar emocional de los individuos, las cuestiones de consentimiento, seguridad y salud sexual, y su impacto en las relaciones y la formación de vínculos a largo plazo. Algunos críticos argumentan que, aunque promueve la libertad y la desinhibición, también puede conducir a sentimientos de vacío, insatisfacción y complejidad en las dinámicas de relación. Es importante notar que las percepciones de la \\"hookup culture\\" pueden variar ampliamente entre individuos y comunidades, y no todos participan o apoyan esta tendencia cultural. La decisión de involucrarse en relaciones sexuales casuales es altamente personal y debe ser considerada con respecto al consentimiento, la seguridad y el bienestar emocional de todas las partes involucradas."},{"instruction":"Can you generate some names similar to Erin Kellyman and Ruby Cruz","output":"Certainly!

[민국이를 만나러 여기까지 왔다고?!] 방무혁의 숨찬 목소리가 들렸다. - 성국아, 미리 연락 못 해서 미안. 출발하면서 연락한다는 게 글쎄, 공항 가는 길에 핸드폰이고 뭐고 다 잃어버렸어. 암튼, 만나서 이야기하자. “오늘은 어디서 주무세요?” - 다행히 출국 전에 공항 근처 호텔은 잡아놨어. 내일 아침 일찍 네가 있는 곳으로 갈게! 방무혁과의 짧고 강렬한 전화 통화가 끝이 났다. 심장이 두근거렸다. [역시, 민국이 녀석. 내가 보는 눈이 틀리지 않았어!] 하지만 민국이에게는 알리지 않았다. 방무혁이 어떤 플랜을 가지고 있을지는 나도 몰랐다. 또 스캇 브라운처럼 엉뚱한 이야기를 할 수도 있었다. 똑. 똑. 똑. 문 두드리는 소리가 들렸다. “형아.” 민국이가 기운 없는 목소리로 고개를 빼꼼 들이밀었다. “안 잤어?” 민국이는 엄마가 지내는 방에 혼자 들어갔었다. “응. 형아는 안 자?” “일 좀 보고 자려고.” “형아, 나 오늘 여기서 자도 돼?” “엄마랑 안 자고?” “한국 가면 엄마야 맨날 볼 거지만, 형아는 이제 또 한동안 못 보잖아.” 민국이는 큰 두 눈을 끔뻑거렸다. [저 눈을 보고 거절하면 사람도 아니지. 나 이렇게 마음 약한 사람 아닌데, 가족들한테만은 이게 조절이 안 된단 말이야.] 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “들어와. 대신, 자면서 형아 발로 차면 안 돼.” “자면서 그러는 건 좀 봐줘야지. 자면서 내가 하는 일을 어떻게 알겠어.” “암튼 말은 잘해요.” 민국이는 이불 속으로 쏙 들어가더니 나를 계속 쳐다봤다. “형아, 안 자?” “형아, 일 볼 게 있어.” “오늘은 왠지 형아를 안고 자야 잠이 올 것 같은데.” “그럼 자지 말고, 30분만 기다려.” “응!” 민국이는 대답을 하고는 일하는 내내 옆에서 종알거렸다. “형아, 스캇 말이야. 그래도 스캇이 인정했으니까, 내가 실력은 있는 거겠지?” “응.” 나는 약간 건성으로 대답했다. 다음 주에 전재형 회장이 참여하는 프레젠테이션 및 검색 포털인 야호와의 약속이 잡혀 있었다. 모두 ‘페이스 노트’에 무척 많은 관심을 보였다. 전재형 회장의 경우는 어떻게든 투자를 물리쳐야 하고, 야호와는 어떻게든 협력을 이끌어내고 싶은 상황이었다. 이제 ‘페이스 노트’는 미국 내에서는 제법 인지도가 올라가고 있었다. 조금만 더 투자를 받는다면 이제 세계적으로도 퍼져나갈 가능성이 충분해지고 있었다. “형아, 근데 말이야. 나 한국으로 돌아가면 그냥 공부나 해볼까. 가수 된다고 해도 성공한다는 보장도 없잖아. 그러다가 공부도 못하면 아무것도 못 하는 거잖아.” 뒤척뒤척. 종알종알. 민국이는 30분 내내 거의 혼자 침대 위에서 중얼거렸다. “아빠 보쌈집에 들어가서 일할까. 아빠 보쌈집 잘되는데, 그거 물려받으면 어떨까.” “하아-.” 나는 인내의 한숨을 내쉬었다. “전민국!” “응, 형아?” “형아 일하는 중이잖아.” “형아, 난 그냥 혼잣말한 거야. TV 켜놨다고 생각해.” 정말 우리 집 남자들 말빨은 알아줘야 했다. 사연팔이가 취미인 아빠에, 종알거리기가 취미인 민국이. “형아, 근데 일 언제 끝나? 이제 30분 다 된 거 같은데?” “하아-.” 아무래도 오늘 일은 여기서 멈춰야 할 것 같았다. 나는 노트북을 닫았다. 이때, 또다시 누가 문을 두드렸다. 똑. 똑. 똑. “누구세요?” 덜컥, 문이 열리더니 인형을 안은 지희가 들어왔다. “성국이 오빠, 지희야.” “지희야, 안 잤어?” “나 오늘 오빠 방에서 잘래.” 민국이가 침대 위에 대자로 눕더니 소리쳤다. “전지희, 잘 데 없어!” “성국이 오빠, 지희도 같이 자자.” 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어나서는 민국이를 들어 올렸다. “형아! 형아!” “자, 형아가 가운데 잘 테니, 오른쪽에 민국이. 왼쪽에 지희 눕는다. 실시!” “실시!” 지희는 손을 바짝 들고는 내 왼편으로 달려왔다. “자, 민국이 너는 오른편으로 간다, 실시!” “실시!” 민국이도 내 오른편으로 바짝 붙었다. 지희가 내 옷깃을 잡아당겼다. “오빠도 눕는다. 실시!” 정말 뉘 집 동생들인지, 도저히 말릴 수가 없었다. 나는 결국, 침대 한가운데 누웠다. 민국이와 지희는 내 팔 하나씩 안고는 배시시 미소를 지었다. “자, 민국이. 지희. 눈 감는다. 실시!” “실시!” “지희도 실시!” 그리고 나도 가만히 눈을 감았다. 어느새 새근거리는 숨소리가 양옆에서 들려왔다. 물론 중간에 퍽퍽 치는 발길질도. 하지만 어느 때보다 깊게 잠을 잤다. * * * 방무혁과의 미팅은 일부러 ‘페이스 노트’ 사무실에서 했다. 스캇 브라운 일 때문에 아빠가 실망하셔서 또 그런 모습을 보여드릴까 걱정이 됐다. 방무혁은 민국이를 보더니 환하게 미소를 지었다. “민국이 안 본 사이에 키가 많이 컸네.” “안녕하세요!” 민국이는 내게 배운 대로 배꼽 인사를 했다. “이 녀석 보게. 예의도 엄청 바르네.” “형아가 가르쳐줬어요.” “그 형에, 그 동생이네. 정말.” 방무혁은 민국이를 이리저리 뜯어봤다. “이 집 유전자야 성국이 봐서 잘 알지. 민국이도 정말 잘 클 거 같아.” [나보다 못하지만, 민국이도 봐줄 만하지. 방무혁?] 민국이는 해맑게 웃었다. “성국이가 냉미남이라면, 민국이는 온미남이네. 여자들이 정말 많이 좋아하게 생겼어.” “무혁이 아저씨, 너무 외모 칭찬만 하지 마세요. 노래랑 춤은 어떻게 보셨어요?” “난 거기서 가능성을 봤어. 진심으로.” 방무혁은 한껏 고무된 얼굴이었다. “그리고 이제 나도 독립을 할 때가 된 것 같아. 혹시 내가 민국이를 우리 회사의 1호 연습생으로 영입해도 될까?” 민국이는 발을 동동 구르며 내 대답을 기다렸다. 나는 민국이의 어깨를 잡았다. “민국아, 이제 나머지는 형한테 맡겨줄래?” “어?” “형이, 무혁이 아저씨랑 사업적인 이야기를 해야 할 것 같아서. 형아, 믿지?” “응!” 민국이는 단번에 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 방무혁을 쳐다봤다. “아저씨, 산책 좀 하실래요?” “좋지!” * * * “날씨가 정말 좋구나.” “저도 여기로 옮겨온 지 얼마 안 됐지만, 확실히 동부보다는 날씨가 좋아요. 아저씨, 정말 독립하실 거예요?” “응. 확실히 마음먹었어. 나도 언제까지나 JP 프로듀서로 살 순 없잖아. 나도 내 음악으로 그룹을 키워보고 싶어. 사실은 작년에 친구를 도와서 친구 회사에서 그룹 하나를 같이 키워봤는데, 의미 있는 성적을 거뒀거든.” 방무혁의 모습에는 자신감이 있었다. 물론 난 알고 있다. 방무혁의 시작이 그렇게 순탄치 않다는 것을. “무혁이 아저씨, 민국이랑 제가 아주 재미있는 계약 하나를 했거든요.” “무슨 계약?” “민국이는 제 회사의 1호 연습생이기도 하거든요.” “뭐어?” 방무혁이 살짝 놀랐다. “성국아, 너도 엔터테인먼트 사업에 관심 있어?” “제가 관심 있다기보다는, 민국이를 위해서요.” 예전에는 대한민국에서 삼전을 뛰어넘으려면 게임 아니면 엔터테인먼트 사업을 해야 한다고 생각했다. 하지만 미국으로 오면서 내 시야도 더 넓어져서 이제 삼전 그룹은 내 시야에서 사라진 지 오래였다. “그럼, 네가 스스로 제작을 해보려고?” “그건 아니에요. 하지만 관심은 있어요. 무혁이 아저씨, 괜찮다면 민국이를 제가 아저씨 회사에 부탁드려도 될까요? 대신, 정식 데뷔조가 되기 전까지는 계약은 저희 소속으로 했으면 합니다.” “그럼, 데뷔조가 되면 그때 다시 계약을 하자고?” “네.” 방무혁은 잠시 고민하더니 결심한 얼굴로 입을 뗐다. “좋아. 내가 한번 민국이 트레이닝을 확실히 해볼게. 민국이는 정말 가능성이 보여. 솔직히 민국이의 보컬이 안정적이고 보이스도 좋긴 한데. 난 랩할 때 굉장히 매력적이었어. 민국이를 좀 더 트레이닝 시킨다면 랩 위주의 힙합 그룹을 만들 수 있을 것 같아.” [이게 바로 나중에 세계를 제패하게 될 그룹 <세븐즈>의 시작이군.] 그리고 그 중심엔 민국이가 서게 될 것이다. 나는 손을 내밀었다. “무혁 아저씨, 저희 민국이 잘 부탁드려요.” 몇 년 후에 방무혁은 중소기획사의 벽을 느끼면서 경제적으로 엄청 위기에 몰린다. 그때를 노려서 나는 방무혁의 경제적인 파트너도 될 작정이다. [내 치밀한 계획은 꿈에도 모르겠지, 방무혁?] 방무혁은 웃으면서 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 나 진짜 민국이 정말 잘 키워볼게. 믿고 맡겨줘.” * * * 민국이는 내 설명을 귀 기울여 들었다. 그 어느 때보다 진지한 얼굴이었다. “형아, 그러니까. 내가 앞으로 그 아저씨 회사에 가서 교육을 받으면 된다는 말이지?” “응. 그 아저씨 굉장히 능력 있는 음악 프로듀서거든. 그리고 절대 한눈팔지 말고, 그 아저씨 말 잘 들어. 알았지?” “응! 형아!” 민국이는 결의에 찬 얼굴이었다. 나는 슬 이야기를 꺼냈다. “민국아, 너 나랑 한 계약은 기억하지?” “어? 무슨 계약?” 민국이는 당황한 얼굴로 괜히 딴청을 피웠다. “우선 우리의 계약서에는 성적도 데뷔 평가에 들어간다는 사실.” “형아, 나 그 아저씨네 회사에서 배우면 그 아저씨네 회사로 데뷔하는 거 아니야? 그러니까 형이랑 맺은 계약은 무효지!” “형과의 계약 조건은 그대로 승계된다는 조건으로 너 그 아저씨 회사에 연습생으로 보내는 거야.” 민국이의 눈에 지진이 일었다. “형아, 너무해.” “그리고 인기 투표 내기 기억하지?” “형아, 연습생 하면서 전교 1등은 무리야.” “민국아, 그런 나약한 마음이라면 지금이라도 늦지 않았어. 가수 포기해.” 나는 차갑게 말했다. 대한민국을 대표하는 가수가 되기 위해서는 그만큼의 각오가 필요했다. 민국이는 잠시 고민하더니 두 주먹을 꼭 쥐고 나를 쳐다봤다. “형아, 한번 해볼게! 정말 최선을 다해볼게! 나는 흐뭇한 얼굴로 민국이를 안았다. 민국이는 조용히 중얼거렸다. “형아 밑에서 공부한 것보다 더 힘들기야 하겠어.” “민국아, 너 그러면 디즈니랜드 못 가는 수가 있어.” “형아, 취소. 취소야!” * * * 전재형 회장은 샌프란시스코 공항에 도착했다. 양 비서는 피곤해 보이는 전재형 회장을 호텔로 안내했다. “회장님, 프레젠테이션은 내일 오후 2시로 잡혀 있습니다. 도련님이 직접 프레젠테이션할 것이라고 합니다.” 전재형 회장은 아무 말도 하지 않았다. 그동안 양 비서를 통해서 전해 들은 전태국의 행동은 정말 기대에 못 미쳤다. ‘페이스 노트’에 투자해서 어떻게든 ‘페이스 노트’를 먹을 생각을 하지도 않고, 그저 그 무리와 놀기 바빴다. 거기다 연예 기획자라는 작자까지 만나고 다닌다고 들었다. 정말 한심하기 그지없었다. “그리고 야호에서 ‘페이스 노트’에 관심을 보이고 있다는 정보입니다. 저희 프레젠테이션 다음 날, 야호와의 약속이 잡혀 있다고 합니다.” “우리가 그전에 ‘페이스 노트’에 꼭 투자해야 해. 철수한테 태국이 믿지 말고, 자료 잘 준비하라고 하게.” “네, 회장님.” * * * 늦은 밤, 전태국이 숙소를 찾았다. “성국아, 우유 한잔할래?” “형, 무슨 일 있어요?” “너한테 할 말이 있어.” [무슨 수작이지?] 나는 애써 담담하게 태국을 따라서 테라스로 나갔다. 태국은 웬일로 술 대신 우유를 마셨다. 내일이 프레젠테이션이라 긴장은 되는 모양이었다. “형, 긴장돼요?” “조금.” “편하게 하세요.” “성국아, 나 내일 프레젠테이션 말이야….” “네.” “엉망으로 망칠 거야.” 이게 무슨 소리지? 난 전태국의 프레젠테이션은 어차피 기대도 안 하고 있었다. 그런데 다짐까지 하다니? “형, 망친다니 그게 무슨 말이세요?” “내가 프레젠테이션을 멋지게 하면 넌 삼전의 투자를 유치해야 할 거잖아.” “그건 저와 공동대표인 마크와 합의를 해야 해요. 그리고 삼전은 저희 회사에 투자하고 싶어서 형을 보낸 거 아닌가요?” “근데, 난 싫거든.” “뭐가요?” “아버지랑 너랑 계속 연결되는 거 말이야.” 전태국은 난생처음 진지한 얼굴로 차가운 우유를 마셨다.","output":"Episode 162 I sprang up from my seat. [You came all the way here to meet Min-guk?!] Bang Mu-hyuk's breathless voice was heard. - Seong-guk, sorry for not contacting you in advance. I meant to call you when I left, but guess what, I lost everything including my phone on the way to the airport. Anyway, let's meet and talk. \\"Where will you sleep tonight?\\" - Luckily, I had booked a hotel near the airport before leaving. I'll come to where you are early tomorrow morning! The short and intense phone call with Bang Mu-hyuk ended. My heart was pounding. [As expected, that guy Min-guk. My judgment wasn't wrong!] However, I didn't inform Min-guk. I didn't know what kind of plan Bang Mu-hyuk had. He could also tell an unexpected story like Scott Brown. Knock. Knock. Knock. The sound of knocking on the door was heard. \\"Brother.\\" Min-guk peeked in with a lifeless voice. \\"Didn't you sleep?\\" Min-guk had gone into the room where his mother was staying alone. \\"Yeah. Aren't you sleeping, brother?\\" \\"I was going to work a bit before sleeping.\\" \\"Brother, can I sleep here tonight?\\" \\"Not sleeping with mom?\\" \\"I'll see mom every day when I go to Korea, but I won't see you for a while.\\" Min-guk blinked his big eyes. [How can I refuse those eyes and still be human? I'm not usually this soft-hearted, but I just can't help it with my family.] I nodded. \\"Come in. But, you can't kick me with your feet while sleeping.\\" \\"You have to overlook it if it happens while I'm sleeping. How would I know what I do in my sleep?\\" \\"Anyway, you talk nicely.\\" Min-guk slipped into the blanket and kept looking at me. \\"Brother, aren't you sleeping?\\" \\"Brother, I have work to do.\\" \\"Today, I feel like I can only fall asleep if I'm hugging you.\\" \\"Then, don't sleep and wait for 30 minutes.\\" \\"Okay!\\" Min-guk responded and chattered beside me while I worked. \\"Brother, about Scott. Still, since Scott acknowledged me, I must have some talent, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I answered somewhat dryly. Next week, there was a presentation and a meeting with Yahoo, a search portal, involving Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. Everyone showed a lot of interest in 'Face Note'. In the case of Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, I had to somehow fend off the investment, and with Yahoo, I wanted to somehow draw out cooperation. Now, 'Face Note' was gaining some recognition in the United States. With a little more investment, it was becoming increasingly possible to spread globally. \\"Brother, but, you know. When I go back to Korea, should I just study? Even if I become a singer, there's no guarantee of success. If I fail at both singing and studying, I'll be good for nothing.\\" Tossing and turning. Chattering. Min-guk murmured almost alone on the bed for 30 minutes. \\"Should I go work at dad's bossam restaurant? Dad's bossam restaurant is doing well, what if I inherit it?\\" \\"Sigh-.\\" I let out a sigh of patience. \\"Jeon Min-guk!\\" \\"Huh, brother?\\" \\"I'm working right now.\\" \\"Brother, I was just talking to myself. Think of it as if the TV was on.\\" Really, the men in our family had a way with words. A dad who loved to tell stories, and Min-guk who loved to chatter. \\"Brother, but when will you finish your work? It seems like 30 minutes are up, right?\\" \\"Sigh-.\\" It seemed like I had to stop working for today. I closed my laptop. Then, someone knocked on the door again. Knock. Knock. Knock. \\"Who is it?\\" The door opened with a click, and Ji-hee entered with a doll in her arms. \\"Seong-guk oppa, it's Ji-hee.\\" \\"Ji-hee, didn't you sleep?\\" \\"I want to sleep in oppa's room tonight.\\" Min-guk lay sprawled on the bed and shouted. \\"Jeon Ji-hee, there's no room!\\" \\"Seong-guk oppa, let's sleep together.\\" I sprang up from my seat and lifted Min-guk. \\"Brother! Brother!\\" \\"Okay, I'll sleep in the middle, Min-guk on the right, Ji-hee on the left. Go!\\" \\"Go!\\" Ji-hee raised her hand high and ran to my left side. \\"Min-guk, you go to the right, go!\\" \\"Go!\\" Min-guk also stuck close to my right side. Ji-hee pulled on my collar. \\"Oppa, lie down too. Go!\\" Really, whose siblings they were, I couldn't stop them. Eventually, I lay down in the middle of the bed. Min-guk and Ji-hee each held one of my arms and smiled broadly. \\"Okay, Min-guk. Ji-hee. Close your eyes. Go!\\" \\"Go!\\" \\"Ji-hee too, go!\\" And I also quietly closed my eyes. Soon, the sound of soft breathing came from both sides. Of course, there were occasional kicks in between. But I slept deeper than ever before. * * * The meeting with Bang Mu-hyuk was deliberately held at the 'Face Note' office. I was worried about showing my dad a disappointing scene again because of the Scott Brown incident. Bang Mu-hyuk saw Min-guk and smiled brightly. \\"Min-guk has grown a lot since I last saw him.\\" \\"Hello!\\" Min-guk greeted with a bow as he had learned from me. \\"Look at this kid. He's so polite.\\" \\"Brother taught me.\\" \\"That brother, that sibling. Really.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk looked Min-guk up and down. \\"This family's genes, Seong-guk knows well. Min-guk will really grow up well.\\" [Not as good as me, but Min-guk is worth looking at, Bang Mu-hyuk?] Min-guk smiled brightly. \\"If Seong-guk is a cold beauty, Min-guk is a warm beauty. Girls will really like him.\\" \\"Mu-hyuk uncle, don't just compliment the appearance. What did you think about the singing and dancing?\\" \\"I saw potential there. Seriously.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk's face was full of encouragement. \\"And now I think it's time for me to go independent. Would it be okay if I recruit Min-guk as the first trainee in our company?\\" Min-guk was hopping in place, waiting for my answer. I grabbed Min-guk's shoulder. \\"Min-guk, can you leave the rest to your brother?\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Brother, I think I need to talk business with uncle Mu-hyuk. You trust your brother, right?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Min-guk nodded his head at once. I looked at Bang Mu-hyuk. \\"Uncle, shall we take a walk?\\" \\"Sounds good!\\" * * * \\"The weather is really nice.\\" \\"I haven't been here long, but the weather is definitely better than the East Coast. Uncle, are you really going independent?\\" \\"Yes. I've made up my mind. I can't live as JP producer forever. I want to grow a group with my own music. Actually, last year, I helped a friend and co-produced a group in his company, and we achieved meaningful results.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk was confident. Of course, I knew. That Bang Mu-hyuk's start wasn't so smooth. \\"Uncle Mu-hyuk, Min-guk and I made a very interesting contract.\\" \\"What contract?\\" \\"Min-guk is also the first trainee of my company.\\" \\"What?\\" Bang Mu-hyuk was slightly surprised. \\"Seong-guk, are you interested in the entertainment business too?\\" \\"It's not so much that I'm interested, but for Min-guk.\\" In the past, I thought that to surpass Samsung in Korea, one had to do either gaming or entertainment business. But since coming to the U.S., my perspective has broadened, and Samsung Group has long disappeared from my sight. \\"So, you're going to produce on your own?\\" \\"Not exactly. But I am interested. Uncle Mu-hyuk, if it's okay with you, could I entrust Min-guk to your company? However, until he becomes an official debut group, I would like the contract to be under our company.\\" \\"So, we'll make a new contract when he becomes a debut group?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Bang Mu-hyuk pondered for a moment and then decided. \\"Okay. I'll train Min-guk properly. I really see potential in Min-guk. Honestly, Min-guk's vocals are stable and his voice is good. But I found him very charming when he raps. If we train Min-guk more, I think we can form a hip-hop group focused on rap.\\" [This is the beginning of the group <Sevenz> that will later conquer the world.] And Min-guk will be at the center of it. I extended my hand. \\"Uncle Mu-hyuk, please take good care of Min-guk.\\" Years later, when Bang Mu-hyuk feels the wall of being a small agency and is in a huge financial crisis, I plan to become his financial partner. [You wouldn't even dream of my meticulous plan, would you, Bang Mu-hyuk?] Bang Mu-hyuk smiled and shook my hand. \\"Seong-guk, I'll really raise Min-guk well. Trust me and leave it to me.\\" * * * Min-guk listened intently to my explanation. He had a more serious face than ever. \\"Brother, so, I just need to go to that uncle's company and receive training?\\" \\"Yes. That uncle is a very capable music producer. And don't get distracted, listen well to what that uncle says. Got it?\\" \\"Yes! Brother!\\" Min-guk's face was full of determination. I gently brought up the topic. \\"Min-guk, do you remember the contract you made with me?\\" \\"Huh? What contract?\\" Min-guk looked flustered and pretended not to know. \\"First of all, our contract states that grades are also included in the debut evaluation.\\" \\"Brother, if I train at that uncle's company, wouldn't I debut under his company? So, the contract I made with you is void!\\" \\"The condition of the contract with me is transferred as you become a trainee at that uncle's company.\\" Min-guk's eyes shook. \\"Brother, that's too harsh.\\" \\"And do you remember the popularity vote bet?\\" \\"Brother, it's impossible to be the top student in the whole school while being a trainee.\\" \\"Min-guk, if you have such a weak heart, it's not too late. Give up on being a singer.\\" I spoke coldly. To become a representative singer of Korea, that much determination was necessary. Min-guk pondered for a moment, then clenched his fists tightly and looked at me. \\"Brother, I'll try! I'll really do my best!\\" I hugged Min-guk with a pleased face. Min-guk murmured quietly. \\"It can't be harder than studying under brother.\\" \\"Min-guk, if you say that, you won't be able to go to Disneyland.\\" \\"Brother, cancel. Cancel!\\" * * * Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung arrived at San Francisco airport. Secretary Yang guided the tired-looking Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung to the hotel. \\"Chairman, the presentation is scheduled for 2 PM tomorrow. The young master will personally do the presentation.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung didn't say anything. The actions of Jeon Tae-guk, as reported by Secretary Yang, were really disappointing. He didn't even think about investing in 'Face Note' to take it over, just busy hanging out with that group. And he was even meeting with some entertainment planner. It was utterly disappointing. \\"And Yahoo is showing interest in 'Face Note'. The day after our presentation, there's a meeting scheduled with Yahoo.\\" \\"We must invest in 'Face Note' before that. Tell Cheol-su not to trust Tae-guk and to prepare the materials well.\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" * * * Late at night, Jeon Tae-guk came to the accommodation. \\"Seong-guk, want a glass of milk?\\" \\"Brother, what's up?\\" \\"I have something to tell you.\\" [What's he up to now?] I followed Tae-guk to the terrace, pretending to be calm. For once, Tae-guk drank milk instead of alcohol. He must be nervous about tomorrow's presentation. \\"Brother, are you nervous?\\" \\"A bit.\\" \\"Just relax.\\" \\"Seong-guk, about tomorrow's presentation...\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I'm going to mess it up.\\" What's he talking about? I wasn't expecting much from Jeon Tae-guk's presentation anyway. But to declare it? \\"Brother, what do you mean you're going to mess it up?\\" \\"If I do the presentation well, you'll have to attract investment from Samsung.\\" \\"That's something I have to discuss with Mark, our co-CEO. And didn't Samsung send you because they want to invest in our company?\\" \\"But, I don't want to.\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"I don't want to keep being connected with dad and you.\\" For the first time, Jeon Tae-guk drank his cold milk with a serious face."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[전태국이 원래 이런 녀석이었나? 저번 생에서 이번 생으로 넘어오면서 사람도 살짝 바뀐 건가….] 나는 괜히 말을 돌렸다. “형, 다음 주에 프레젠테이션 있잖아요. 그건 준비 안 하세요?” “양 비서가 도와주고 있어. 나야 뭐, PPT 보면서 읽기만 하면 되는 거 아니야?” “태국이 형, 그 정도 수준은 아닐 것 같은데요. 저 역시 회장님과 약속한 게 있어서 살살 넘어가진 않을 텐데요.” “흠… 솔직히 난 아버지가 왜 ‘페이스 노트’에 지대한 관심을 가지는지 모르겠어. 암튼 너무 걱정하지 마. 나 잘할 자신 있어.” [끝나고도 그렇게 말할 수 있는지 지켜보겠어, 전태국] * * * 아빠는 또 한 상을 차렸다. 보쌈과 각종 한국 반찬들이 상 가득 올라왔다. 거기다 오늘은 만둣국까지! “엄마, 만두는 어디서 샀어?” “성국아, 너 만둣국 잘 먹었잖아. 엄마도 이제 인터넷 이런 거 잘하거든. 여기 한국식 만두 파는 집 알아내서 양 비서님한테 부탁 좀 했어.” 그 때문에 오늘 저녁 자리에도 전태국과 양 비서가 함께였다. 전태국은 만둣국의 육수를 음미했다. “캬아, 이거 맛이 정말 끝내주네요. 아저씨, 만둣국 사업 한번 해보실래요?” “태국 군, 미안한데. 이거 만둣국 육수는 곰탕 라면 스프야.” “흠. 흠. 제가 워낙 인스턴트를 안 먹어서요.” 전태국은 민망한지 괜히 헛기침을 챘다. 모두 웃음을 참으며 저녁 식사를 이어갔다. 민국이가 똘망똘망한 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “형아, 내 너튜브에 댓글 단 사람 말이야. 그 사람 진짜 우리 만나러 온대?” “응. 이번 일요일에 샌프란시스코에 있는 모다 레스토랑에서 만나기로 했어. 민국아, 형아랑 같이 나가보자.” “와우! 와우! 와우!” 민국이는 뛸 듯이 좋아했다. “성국아, 무슨 일이야? 누굴 만난다는 거야?” “아빠, 밥 먹으면서 말씀드리려고 했는데요. 민국이가 방학 동안 너튜브라고 동영상 올리는 사이트에 춤이나 노래 동영상을 좀 올렸어요. 그걸 보고 미국의 유명 연예 기획자가 만나자고 해서요.” “그 사람 믿을 만한 사람이야?” 아빠는 당연히 걱정부터 앞섰다. “아저씨, 성국이의 부탁으로 삼전 그룹의 후계자인 제가 직접 그 사람 검증했으니 걱정 마세요. 그리고 만나는 자리에는 저도 같이 나가려고요. 제가 워낙 한국이나 미국 연예계 쪽을 잘 알거든요.” 나와 민국이는 동시에 고개를 절레절레 저었다. [허세, 어쩔….] 전태국이 순간 우리 둘을 쳐다보자 나와 민국이는 자연스레 만둣국을 먹으며 딴소리를 했다. “민국아, 넌 다이어트 좀 해야 하는 거 아니야? 이렇게 볼살 통통해서 되겠어, 가수가?” 민국이는 자신의 만둣국 속 만두를 내게 건넸다. “형아, 많이 먹어. 난 오늘부터 빡세게 다이어트할 거야.” 민국이는 두 주먹을 불끈 쥐며 다짐했다. “성국아, 태국 군 통해서 알아본 거니까 믿을 만하겠지만, 아빠는 왜 불안하지?” “아빠! 아빠도 같이 나가자!” 민국이가 불쑥 대답했다. “어? 내가? 아빠는 영어도 모르잖아.” “형아가 통역해주면 되지.” 이때, 슬쩍 본 전태국의 표정은 조금 귀찮은 것 같았다. 그렇다면 당연히! “아빠, 아빠도 같이 가요. 당연히 민국이 일인데, 같이 가셔야죠. 영어는 제가 통역해 드릴게요. 민국이도 영어 아직 그렇게 잘 못해서 제가 옆에서 알려주긴 해야 해요.” “그럴까? 근데… 그런 자리에 나가려면 옷도 좀 근사해야 하고… 할 텐데. 아빠는 옷도 다 이렇고….” “아빠, 전 맨날 후드티인걸요. 걱정 마세요.” “잠깐만!” 전태국이 급히 대화에 끼어들었다. “왜요, 형?” “삼전 그룹 후계자인 나와 함께 나가는데, 다들 격 좀 맞춰주면 안 될까?” “형, 그러고 싶어도 저희는 옷이 다 편한 옷밖에 없어요.” “흠… 다들 내일 시간 되죠? 내일 근처 명품 매장 가서 양복으로 짝 빼입죠.” “형, 저흰 괜찮아요.” 나는 전태국을 말렸지만, 눈치 없는 민국이가 손을 번쩍 들었다. “형아! 코올!” * * * 스캇 브라운의 약속이 있는 아침까지도 방무혁에게는 답이 없었다. 방무혁은 분명 동영상을 확인하고 연락하겠다는 메시지를 남겼다. [방무혁 눈에는 별로인가?] 이건 큰 문제였다. 내가 설계한 민국이의 미래가 달라질 수도 있기 때문이었다. 만약 방무혁의 눈에 들지 못하면, 민국이는 진짜 스캇 브라운과 일하는 게 나을 수도 있었다. 뒤에서 아빠와 민국이가 부스럭거리는 소리가 들렸다. “아빠, 이렇게 입는 거 맞아?” “와, 우리 민국이 이렇게 입으니 멋진데!” 전태국은 스타일리스트까지 고용해서 근처 명품 매장에서 우리 옷까지 죄다 맞췄다. 아빠도 어느새 셔츠에 팬츠를 입고 있었다. 민국이는 신이 나서 방방 뛰었다. “아빠, 아빠! 너무 멋져!” 맨날 보쌈집에서 조리복 입은 모습만 보다가 멀끔하게 차려입은 아빠를 보니까 입가가 스윽 올라갔다. 아빠는 키가 꽤 크고, 따로 운동을 한 건 아니지만 주방 일이 워낙 힘들어서 몸도 탄탄했다. [엄마가 아빠를 선택한 건 정말 옳은 일이었어….] 나는 흐뭇하게 아빠를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너도 어서 우리랑 같이 옷 입자.” “아빠, 난 데님에 후드티가 편해.” 그 순간, 민국이가 얼른 내 손을 잡아끌었다. “형아, 형아 어서! 오늘은 민국이 손님 만나러 가는 날이잖아. 그니까 민국이 원하는 대로 해주라. 응?” [이 녀석은 도대체 당할 수가 없다니까!] 민국이는 나를 마구잡이로 끌더니 바지를 잡아 내렸다. “민국아! 형이 할게!” “이렇게 안 하면 형 또 이 옷 입고 나갈 거잖아!” “알았어. 알았어. 그만! 형이 진짜 태국이 형이 준 옷 입을게.” 그제야 민국이는 씨익 입꼬리를 올리며 끌어내리던 바지를 놨다. “형아, 5분 안에 안 입으면 내가 또 바지 잡아 내릴 거야!” [이건 군대 조교보다도 무섭잖아!] 나는 속으로 투덜거리면서 옷을 갈아입었다. 역시 삼전 그룹에서 부른 스타일리스트가 고른 옷이라 그런지 세련된 디자인에 딱 알맞은 핏이었다. 타이 같은 것은 하지 않고, 셔츠는 단추를 몇 개 풀었다. 바지는 발목까지 오는 면바지로 너무 캐주얼하지도, 너무 딱딱하지도 않았다. 눈썹 위까지 내려오는 머리를 살짝 쓸어올리는데… 이때 여자의 비명이 들렸다. “으아아악!” 동시에 나는 나를 지켜보고 있던 리미미와 눈이 마주치고 말았다. “사, 사장님….” “리미미 씨는 여기 웬일이세요?” “사장님, 맞으세요?” “리미미 씨, 여기 무슨 일로 와서 갑자기 소리를 지른 거예요?” “아, 사장님 어머니가 오늘 다들 나가서 저녁 먹는다고 저희 보고 와서 저녁 먹으라고 하셔서요. 마크랑 왔죠.” 뒤로 마크가 고개를 삐죽 내밀더니 박수를 치기 시작했다. “성국! 그렇게 입으니까 꼭 살찌기 전의 레오 같아!” [뭘 이런 걸 가지고. 레오랑 비교하다니… 난 그렇게 관리 안 하는 스타일 아니라고.] 이때, 마크와 리미미가 수군거리는 소리가 들렸다. “또 어깨 올라간다.” “마크, 그러니까 너무 띄워줬어요.” “두 사람 말하는 거 다 들리거든.” 이때, 엄마와 지희가 열린 문 사이로 나를 쳐다봤다. 지희의 눈이 갑자기 커지더니 나를 향해 달려오기 시작했다. “오빠!” 지희는 나에게 와락 안겼다. “지희야, 오빠 멋있지?” “응! 오빠가 세상에서 제일 멋있어!” 지희는 엄지를 치켜세웠다. 세상 누가 뭐라고 해도 지희만 멋있다고 하면 됐다. “형아, 늦겠어. 어서 나와.” 밖에서 민국이의 재촉하는 목소리가 들렸다. “지금 나가.” 나는 곧 지희를 내려놓고 방을 나섰다. * * * 양 비서가 모는 차가 레스토랑 앞에 멈췄다. 나는 얼른 뒷좌석에 앉은 아빠와 민국이, 그리고 전태국을 쳐다봤다. “자, 준비되셨죠?” “당연하지!” “네에!” “성국아, 가자!” 모두 옷깃을 매만지며 차에서 내렸다. 나도 오랜만에 입은 셔츠의 소매를 걷으며 차에서 내렸다. 우리 가족이 동시에 차에서 내리자 거리를 지나던 사람들의 낮은 탄성이 여기저기서 들렸다. 여자들은 감탄사를 내뱉었고, 남자들은 그런 여자친구를 끌고 가기 바빴다. 전태국이 나를 흘깃 보더니 속삭였다. “성국아, 넌 이런 시선 익숙하지?” “자주 겪었던 일이라서요. 그래서 제가 헝클어진 머리에, 후드티만 입는 거예요. 시선이 귀찮아서요.” 전태국이 어이없어 했지만, 나는 어깨를 으쓱하곤 레스토랑의 문을 열었다. * * * 민국이와 나를 발견한 스캇 브라운은 자리에서 일어났다. 그러곤 살짝 흥분된 얼굴로 우리 가족을 쳐다봤다. “어… 여기가 민국이고. 여긴 동영상에도 나왔던 천재 형인 성국.” 스캇 브라운의 시선이 아빠에게 향했다. “더 큰 형이 계셨어요?” “저희 아빠세요.” “와우!” 스캇 브라운은 무척이나 감탄한 얼굴이었다. 이때, 옆에 있던 전태국이 중얼거렸다. “나는 왜 안 물어보는 거야?” 그 말에 스캇 브라운의 시선이 당연히 전태국에게 향했다. “아하, 그쪽이 대한민국 삼전 그룹의 후계자시군요. 이런 자리까지 나와 주셔서 영광입니다.” “저도 이 가족들과 아주 밀접한 관련이 있거든요.” 전태국은 어떻게든 우리 가족과 엮이고 싶어 하는 모습이 역력했지만, 스캇 브라운은 얼른 대화를 민국이에게로 돌렸다. “너튜브 영상 중에서 단연 네 영상이 제일 좋았어. 특히 버스킹하는 거 찍어 올린 거랑 춤추는 거. 대단하던데?” 나는 아빠에게 스캇 브라운이 민국이에 대해서 칭찬을 하고 있다고 그대로 통역했다. 자, 이제는 본론으로 들어갈 시간이었다. “스캇, 제 동생인 민국이를 좋게 봐주셔서 너무 감사해요. 그래서 저희는 민국이한테 관심이 있단 말이 정확히 무슨 의미인지 알고 싶거든요.” “미국도 지금 아시아계 인구들이 많이 늘었거든요. 저는 민국이가 미국 시장뿐 아니라 일본과 같은 아시아 시장에도 활약할 수 있는 가능성을 봤거든요.” 스캇 브라운은 자신에 찬 얼굴로 우리를 쳐다봤다. 순간, 나의 미간이 구겨졌다. “일본 시장이라고요?” “사실 아시아계 남자가 미국에서 인기를 얻기에는 조금 힘들잖아요. 제가 일본 쪽이랑도 일을 하고 있어서요.” “스캇 브라운 씨. 먼 길 오셨으니까 식사나 하고 가시죠.” 나는 더는 스캇 브라운의 말을 들을 이유가 없었다. * * * 집으로 돌아온 민국이는 실망한 기색이 역력했다. 일찍 자겠다며 방에 들어가 버렸다. 스캇 브라운은 일본 시장용으로 민국이를 키우고 싶어 했다. 그건 나도, 민국이도 바라는 것이 당연히 아니었다. 나는 차가운 우유를 마시며 노트북을 열었다. 혹시나 방무혁에게 연락이 와있을까 해서였다. 하지만 방무혁에게서 아무런 메시지도 없었다. [민국이가 별로인가….] 민국이가 거절당한 게 꼭 내가 거절당한 것처럼 마음이 무거웠다. 이때, 핸드폰이 울렸다. 발신자 번호조차 뜨지 않는 번호였다. 나는 잠시 망설이다 전화를 받았다. 전화기 너머로 익숙한 목소리가 들렸다. - 성국아, 나 무혁이 아저씨야. 전화기 너머로 도로의 소음이 시끄럽게 들렸다. “아저씨…. 어디세요?” - 성국아, 나 민국이 만나러 샌프란시스코에 막 도착했어!","output":"Episode 161 Scott Brown also contacted us. - You guys are in Silicon Valley now, right? I'll fly over right away! Just set the time and place you want. Scott Brown was very proactive. At the same time, there was another person who was just as eager. It was Jeon Tae-guk. \\"Seong-guk, did you set up a meeting with Scott or whatever his name is?\\" \\"Yes, he said he could come over this Sunday.\\" \\"Hmm… Where did you decide to meet?\\" \\"We haven't decided on the exact place yet, but we're thinking of meeting in San Francisco.\\" \\"Really? Then, how about meeting at Moda, a Michelin restaurant in San Francisco?\\" \\"I was just thinking of meeting up casually.\\" \\"What are you talking about? As the heir to the Samjeon Group, I should at least meet at that kind of restaurant. And even if Scott Brown is a somewhat well-known entertainment planner, we need to show him what kind of people we are so we don't get pushed around.\\" [Hmm… Jeon Tae-guk is still full of bluster.] Moda Restaurant was one of the places I used to frequent when I came to San Francisco in my previous life. \\"Tae-guk hyung, if it's uncomfortable, you don't have to come out with us.\\" \\"I asked for your help, so I should take responsibility until the end.\\" My eyes narrowed. [Was Jeon Tae-guk always like this? Did people slightly change when I moved from my previous life to this one…?] I changed the subject for no reason. \\"Hyung, you have a presentation next week, aren't you preparing for it?\\" \\"Yang Secretary is helping me. I just have to read the PPT, right?\\" \\"Tae-guk hyung, it doesn't seem like it will be that simple. I also have a promise with the chairman, so it won't be easy to get by.\\" \\"Hmm… Honestly, I don't understand why my father is so interested in 'Face Note'. Anyway, don't worry too much. I'm confident I'll do well.\\" [I'll see if you can still say that after it's over, Jeon Tae-guk.] * * * Dad prepared another meal. Bossam and various Korean side dishes filled the table. And today, there was even manduguk! \\"Mom, where did you buy the dumplings?\\" \\"Seong-guk, you like manduguk, right? Mom is good at using the internet now. I found a place that sells Korean-style dumplings and asked Secretary Yang for a favor.\\" Because of that, Jeon Tae-guk and Secretary Yang were also present at dinner tonight. Jeon Tae-guk savored the broth of the manduguk. \\"Wow, this tastes really amazing. Uncle, have you ever thought about starting a manduguk business?\\" \\"Tae-guk, I'm sorry, but this manduguk broth is from beef bone soup ramen.\\" \\"Hmm. Hmm. I don't really eat instant food, you see.\\" Jeon Tae-guk coughed awkwardly, embarrassed. Everyone continued their dinner, trying to hold back their laughter. Min-guk looked at me with bright eyes. \\"Hyung, about the person who commented on my YouTube. That person is really coming to meet us?\\" \\"Yes. We decided to meet at Moda Restaurant in San Francisco this Sunday. Min-guk, let's go out with hyung.\\" \\"Wow! Wow! Wow!\\" Min-guk was thrilled. \\"Seong-guk, what's going on? Who are you meeting?\\" \\"Dad, I was going to tell you while eating. Min-guk has been uploading dance and song videos on YouTube during his vacation. A famous American entertainment planner saw it and wants to meet.\\" \\"Is that person trustworthy?\\" Dad was naturally worried first. \\"Uncle, as the heir to the Samjeon Group, I personally verified that person at Seong-guk's request, so don't worry. I'm also planning to go with them. I'm quite familiar with the entertainment industry in Korea and the US.\\" Min-guk and I simultaneously shook our heads. [Bluff, what to do…] Jeon Tae-guk glanced at us for a moment, and Min-guk and I naturally continued eating our manduguk and changed the subject. \\"Min-guk, shouldn't you be dieting? Can you be a singer with your cheeks so chubby?\\" Min-guk passed his dumpling in the manduguk to me. \\"Hyung, eat a lot. I'm going to start a strict diet from today.\\" Min-guk clenched his fists, determined. \\"Seong-guk, since Tae-guk checked it out through his connections, it must be trustworthy, but why do I feel uneasy?\\" \\"Dad! Let's go together!\\" Min-guk suddenly answered. \\"Me? I don't even know English.\\" \\"Hyung will translate for you.\\" At that moment, Jeon Tae-guk's expression seemed a bit annoyed. Naturally! \\"Dad, let's go together. It's about Min-guk, so we should go together. I'll translate for you. Min-guk isn't that good at English yet, so I have to help him.\\" \\"Should I? But… if I'm going to such a place, I need to dress up… I only have these clothes.\\" \\"Dad, I always wear hoodies. Don't worry.\\" \\"Wait a minute!\\" Jeon Tae-guk hurriedly joined the conversation. \\"Why, hyung?\\" \\"If I, the heir to the Samjeon Group, am going out with you, could everyone dress a bit more appropriately?\\" \\"Hyung, we want to, but we only have comfortable clothes.\\" \\"Hmm… Do you all have time tomorrow? Let's go to a nearby luxury store and get suited up.\\" \\"Hyung, we're fine.\\" I tried to stop Jeon Tae-guk, but Min-guk, who was clueless, raised his hand excitedly. \\"Hyung! Cool!\\" * * * There was no response from Bang Mu-hyuk until the morning of the meeting with Scott Brown. Bang Mu-hyuk had definitely left a message saying he would check the video and contact us. [Does Min-guk not appeal to Bang Mu-hyuk?] This was a big problem. The future I had designed for Min-guk could change. If Bang Mu-hyuk wasn't interested, working with Scott Brown might actually be better for Min-guk. I heard Dad and Min-guk rustling behind me. \\"Dad, am I wearing this right?\\" \\"Wow, Min-guk looks so cool dressed like this!\\" Jeon Tae-guk had even hired a stylist and fitted us all with clothes from a nearby luxury store. Dad was now dressed in a shirt and pants. Min-guk was jumping around excitedly. \\"Dad, Dad! You look so cool!\\" Seeing Dad dressed up neatly instead of his usual chef's uniform made me smile. Dad is quite tall, and although he doesn't exercise separately, his body is firm from the physically demanding kitchen work. [Choosing Dad was really the right thing to do…] I looked at Dad fondly. \\"Seong-guk, come get dressed with us.\\" \\"Dad, I'm comfortable in denim and a hoodie.\\" At that moment, Min-guk quickly grabbed my hand. \\"Hyung, hurry! Today is the day Min-guk meets his guest. So, do as Min-guk wants, okay?\\" [I can't win against this kid!] Min-guk dragged me around and started pulling down my pants. \\"Min-guk! I'll do it!\\" \\"If you don't do this, hyung, you'll go out wearing those clothes again!\\" \\"Okay, okay, stop! I'll really wear the clothes Tae-guk hyung gave me.\\" Only then did Min-guk smile slyly and let go of the pants he was pulling down. \\"Hyung, if you don't get dressed in 5 minutes, I'll pull down your pants again!\\" [This is scarier than a military drill instructor!] I grumbled inwardly as I changed my clothes. Sure enough, the clothes selected by the stylist called by the Samjeon Group were stylishly designed and fit perfectly. I didn't wear a tie, and I unbuttoned a few buttons on the shirt. The pants were cotton pants that reached the ankles, not too casual or too stiff. As I slightly brushed up my hair that fell above my eyebrows… At that moment, a woman's scream was heard. \\"Aaaah!\\" At the same time, I locked eyes with Rimimi, who was watching me. \\"Ma, Manager…\\" \\"Rimimi, what brings you here?\\" \\"Manager, is that you?\\" \\"Rimimi, why did you come here and suddenly scream?\\" \\"Ah, Manager's mother told us to come and have dinner here today since you all were going out. I came with Mark.\\" Behind her, Mark peeked out and started clapping. \\"Seong-guk! Dressed like that, you look just like Leo before he gained weight!\\" [Comparing me to Leo… I'm not the type to neglect my appearance.] At that moment, I heard Mark and Rimimi whispering. \\"His shoulders are up again.\\" \\"Mark, you praised him too much.\\" \\"You two know I can hear you, right?\\" At that moment, Mom and Ji-hee looked at me through the open door. Ji-hee's eyes suddenly widened, and she started running towards me. \\"Oppa!\\" Ji-hee hugged me tightly. \\"Ji-hee, does oppa look cool?\\" \\"Yes! Oppa is the coolest in the world!\\" Ji-hee gave a thumbs up. As long as Ji-hee says I'm cool, that's all that matters. \\"Hyung, we'll be late. Hurry up.\\" Min-guk's urging voice was heard from outside. \\"I'm coming out.\\" I soon put Ji-hee down and left the room. * * * Secretary Yang's car stopped in front of the restaurant. I quickly looked at Dad, Min-guk, and Jeon Tae-guk sitting in the back seat. \\"Are you all ready?\\" \\"Of course!\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Seong-guk, let's go!\\" Everyone adjusted their collars and got out of the car. I also rolled up the sleeves of my shirt and got out of the car. As our family got out of the car at the same time, low exclamations were heard from people passing by on the street. Women let out sighs of admiration, and men hurriedly pulled their girlfriends away. Jeon Tae-guk glanced at me and whispered. \\"Seong-guk, you're used to this kind of attention, aren't you?\\" \\"I've experienced it often. That's why I only wear hoodies and have messy hair. The attention is bothersome.\\" Jeon Tae-guk looked incredulous, but I just shrugged and opened the door to the restaurant. * * * Scott Brown, who spotted Min-guk and me, stood up. Then, with a slightly excited face, he looked at our family. \\"Ah… This must be Min-guk. And this is the genius brother, Seong-guk, who appeared in the video.\\" Scott Brown's gaze turned to Dad. \\"Is there an older brother?\\" \\"He's our dad.\\" \\"Wow!\\" Scott Brown was very impressed. At that moment, Jeon Tae-guk muttered. \\"Why doesn't he ask about me?\\" Naturally, Scott Brown's gaze turned to Jeon Tae-guk. \\"Aha, so you're the heir to the Samjeon Group of South Korea. It's an honor to have you here.\\" \\"I have a very close relationship with this family.\\" Jeon Tae-guk was clearly trying to associate himself with our family, but Scott Brown quickly turned the conversation back to Min-guk. \\"The YouTube videos, especially the busking and dancing ones, were outstanding. You're amazing.\\" I translated to Dad that Scott Brown was praising Min-guk. Now, it was time to get to the main point. \\"Scott, we're very grateful that you think highly of my brother, Min-guk. So, we'd like to know exactly what you mean by being interested in Min-guk.\\" \\"The Asian population in the US has increased a lot now. I see potential in Min-guk not only in the US market but also in the Asian market, like Japan.\\" Scott Brown looked at us with a confident face. Suddenly, my brows furrowed. \\"The Japanese market?\\" \\"Actually, it's a bit difficult for Asian men to gain popularity in the US. I'm also working with Japan.\\" \\"Scott Brown, you've come a long way, so let's have a meal before you go.\\" I didn't see any reason to listen to Scott Brown anymore. * * * Returning home, Min-guk was visibly disappointed. He said he would go to bed early and went to his room. Scott Brown wanted to groom Min-guk for the Japanese market. That was obviously not what Min-guk or I wanted. I drank cold milk and opened my laptop. I was hoping for a message from Bang Mu-hyuk. But there was no message from Bang Mu-hyuk. [Does Min-guk not appeal to him…?] It felt as heavy as if I had been rejected myself. Then, my phone rang. The caller ID didn't even show up. I hesitated for a moment before answering. A familiar voice came through. - Seong-guk, it's Uncle Mu-hyuk. The noise of the road was loud on the other side of the phone. \\"Uncle… where are you?\\" - Seong-guk, I just arrived in San Francisco to meet Min-guk!"},{"instruction":"Give me names similar to Jade Xlwymi","output":"Creating names similar to \\"Jade Xlwymi\\" involves looking at both parts of the name separately and then combining them.
