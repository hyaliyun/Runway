The conflict centers on a proposal to change a French unemployment fund for artists that takes into account their downtime between shows . France has a unique unemployment fund for artists that takes into account their downtime between shows . Do the above sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While the two sentences share significant similarities, there are subtle differences in their overall meanings and emphasis. Let's break them down to better understand the nuances within each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"The conflict centers on a proposal to change a French unemployment fund for artists that takes into account their downtime between shows.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the conflict arising from a proposal to change the French unemployment fund for artists. The \\"downtime between shows\\" element is mentioned to highlight the unique aspect of this specific unemployment fund, and the sentence implies that there might be a disagreement or strong reactions regarding the proposed changes. The sentence is centered around the conflict and the proposal itself. Sentence 2: \\"France has a unique unemployment fund for artists that takes into account their downtime between shows.\\" This sentence is primarily describing the existence and uniqueness of the French unemployment fund for artists. Although there is an emphasis on the fund taking into account the \\"downtime between shows,\\" this sentence does not mention any conflicts, proposals, or potential changes to the fund. It merely serves as a statement of the current situation in France concerning the artist unemployment fund. In summary, while both sentences discuss the French unemployment fund for artists that considers their downtime between shows, Sentence 1 emphasizes the conflict and proposal to change the fund, whereas Sentence 2 only states the existence of the fund and its unique feature, without implying any conflicts or changes related to it. Hence, the sentences do not entirely convey the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Tuberculosis.","output":"What are the causes, symptoms, modes of transmission, diagnosis, and treatment options for Tuberculosis (TB)? Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs, but can also impact other organs such as the kidneys, spine, and brain. TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, with millions of people affected each year. Causes: Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which spreads through the air when people with the active disease cough, sneeze, talk or spit. The bacteria can survive in the air for several hours, increasing the likelihood of transmission in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces. While TB is contagious, it is not easy to catch, as prolonged close contact with an infected person is typically required for transmission. Symptoms: TB can be classified into two forms: latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease.  Latent TB infection: - No symptoms - Cannot spread TB bacteria to others - Diagnosed using a TB skin or blood test - At risk of developing active TB disease, especially if the immune system weakens Active TB disease: - Symptoms may include a persistent cough (lasting longer than three weeks), coughing up blood, chest pain, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, lack of appetite, fever, chills, night sweats and shortness of breath - Can spread TB bacteria to others - Diagnosed using a chest X-ray, sputum culture, and other tests Modes of Transmission: TB is transmitted through the air via droplet nuclei containing the bacteria. These tiny droplets are expelled into the air when an infected person with active TB disease coughs, sneezes, talks, or spits. People nearby can inhale the bacteria, which then travel to and potentially infect their lungs. It is important to note that TB is not transmitted through physical contact, sharing food or drink, or casual contact like shaking hands or touching objects. Diagnosis: Diagnosing TB can involve several tests, including: 1. TB skin test (Mantoux tuberculin skin test, or TST): involves injecting a small amount of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) under the skin and evaluating the reaction after 48-72 hours. 2. TB blood test (interferon-gamma release assays, or IGRA): measures the immune response to TB bacteria in a blood sample. 3. Chest X-ray: used to detect abnormalities in the lungs, which could indicate TB infection. 4. Sputum tests: examination of sputum samples under a microscope and culturing the bacteria to confirm the presence of M. tuberculosis and determine its drug sensitivity. Treatment Options: Tuberculosis is treated with a combination of antibiotics, usually over a period of six to nine months. The most commonly prescribed medications include isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Adherence to the treatment regimen is crucial for successful eradication of the bacteria and preventing the development of drug-resistant TB. In some cases, where drug-resistant TB is present, a more intensive and longer treatment course with additional second-line drugs may be necessary. In summary, Tuberculosis is a contagious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It spreads through the air and primarily affects the lungs. The symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, weight loss, and fever. Diagnosis involves several tests, such as skin tests, blood tests, and chest X-rays. Treatment requires a combination of antibiotics, which must be taken diligently to eradicate the infection and prevent drug resistance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, Frank Black, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including Teenager of the Year (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album Mangled.

The band played live only occasionally until 2001.In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including Crime and Punishment in Suburbia in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series Undeclared with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album Statecraft.

Fact 2: Seasonal flowering plants planted.  Given the two facts above, what do some flowers use to store most of their water? A:","output":"Given the two facts provided, it can be deduced that some flowers use stems to store most of their water.  Fact 1 states that a stem is used to store water by some plants. This indicates that stems are an essential component in certain plants' adaptations for water storage. Stems have a unique structure with vascular tissues, xylem and phloem, that help in the transportation and storage of water, minerals, and food. In particular, there are specialized stem structures known as succulent stems found in some plants adapted to arid environments. These succulent stems are designed to store a considerable amount of water to help the plant survive in drought conditions. Some examples include cactus plants and various succulent species. Fact 2 mentions that seasonal flowering plants are planted. Seasonal flowering plants may exhibit various strategies to adapt to their environments and meet their water requirements. While stems can serve essential functions in supporting the plant and aiding in the transport and storage of water and nutrients, other structures and physiological processes may also play a role in water storage, although not as prominent as stems. For instance, certain plants may have enlarged root systems or leaves with water-retaining tissues to store water. Based on the two facts provided, it is clear that some flowers rely on stems to store most of their water. It is important to note that different types of plants, including flowering plants, may exhibit variations in their adaptations for water storage and homeostasis depending on their specific ecological niche, growth cycle, and climate requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The Treasury has claimed that Scottish government plans to increase borrowing under independence would be incompatible with retaining the pound.","output":"Title: Scottish Government's Increased Borrowing Under Independence at Odds with Retaining the Pound, Claims Treasury Introduction The United Kingdom Treasury has recently made claims that the Scottish government's proposal to enhance borrowing under independence would create a significant conflict with the nation's desire to retain the British pound. The following article provides a detailed overview of these counter-claims, the rationale behind the Scottish government's intentions, and the potential ramifications on both Scotland's and the United Kingdom's economies. Counter-Claims from the Treasury The Treasury, which oversees the UK's public finances and economic policy, has expressed concerns over the Scottish government's proposal to increase borrowing as a potentially independent nation. The primary concern is that the decision to borrow more money would be incompatible with Scotland's aim to continue using the pound Sterling as its official currency. This potential incompatibility raises questions about how the nation would maintain economic stability should it proceed with its plan to become independent from the rest of the UK. Scottish Government's Intentions The Scottish government's plan to increase borrowing stems from a desire to stimulate economic growth and invest in public services. As an independent nation, Scotland would possess more autonomy in terms of managing its fiscal policies and resources allocation. The increased borrowing is seen as a means to take advantage of this autonomy, primarily to address issues such as inequality, climate change, and the to recover from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. The Rationale Behind Treasury's Concerns The Treasury claims that the increased borrowing under independence could pose a risk to Scotland's economic stability if it continues using the British pound. This is because the Bank of England, which currently sets UK's monetary policy, would have no oversight or responsibility for Scotland as an independent nation. As a result, Scotland's ability to influence the monetary policy may be limited, and this lack of control could make it challenging to manage the nation's debt and maintain financial stability. Potential Ramifications on Scottish and UK Economies If the Scottish government presses forward with its plans for increased borrowing and retains the pound, potential consequences could impact both Scotland and the United Kingdom. For Scotland, there may be increased borrowing costs, reduced investor confidence, and a limited capacity to address economic challenges. These factors could slow down the nation's economic growth and postpone its recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, if Scotland achieves independence and cannot retain the pound, it may need to establish a new currency or join a different monetary union. This process would involve significant costs and complexities, and the new currency's value might fluctuate considerably compared to the pound and other global currencies. Moreover, it could lead to potential trade and economic disruptions between Scotland and the remaining UK. Conclusion The debate surrounding Scotland's potential independence and increased borrowing is a complex issue with many economic, political, and social factors to consider. The UK Treasury's concerns highlight the need for a thorough examination of these factors as they could have crucial consequences for both Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Ultimately, it remains to be seen how these discussions will progress and shape the future of the UK and Scotland's relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Problem:Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST :  My bipolar brother who is heavily dependent on his medication revealed to me tonight that not only has he stopped taking his meds but that he also stopped seeing his therapist as far back as a month ago.  And purposely kept it from everyone. I LOVE my brother completely. We're four years apart but we've always shared everything. People sometimes confuse us for twins but we just roll with it, and, honestly, love it. We have  similar interests and love debating most things, especially, \\"hot topics\\" like religion and politics. We both suffer from depression, anxiety and ADHD, however, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was in early high school and, most recently, borderline personality disorder. His manic/depression made it very hard for him to make friends with other kids and opened him up to a lot of bullying; to the point that he had to withdraw from public high school and finish the rest online. I've always supported him and been his number one fan, although, I was quite cruel to him when I was in middle school. I think about this often and regret my every action during this time. I was a hurting kid with no outlet and I, without mercy, rained my suffering down upon him.  Because I believe that I had a substantially negative role on him growing up, I have since modified my behavior towards him now that I am an adult and not some awful, hormone ruled monster. I try to be everything to him that I had the inability to be to him before: supportive, generous, loving, excepting. He truly is an amazing human being...except when he's not on his meds. That's when his mania is unleashed. I have been around him all his life so I know when he is manic. It's something in his voice, the way he gestures, the way his face contorts when he thinks no one is looking. He's not my brother anymore. And it's only made worse by alcohol because that's when he starts hallucinating. He starts telling me about how everything he's ever told me is a lie and that he's never cared about me. How he's lied about seeing a therapist and how he's manipulated everyone around him for the sheer joy of doing it. The ways he's used me and taken pleasure in my pain. There have been multiple times where he has made me cry in public or made me remove myself and himself from certain circumstances in public. It makes me extremely distressed to see my brother go manic so I usually start crying. Literally begging him to calm down and see sense and if he still doesn't listen, I involve my parents as a last ditch effort. That's when he starts gas-lighting me. Tells my parents that I've just gotten upset at nothing and he doesn't understand why I'm acting so hysterical. That it is unfair and harsh and \\"weird\\" that I should be reacting to him in this way.  That I'm \\"freaking him out\\" because I expressing remorse over the news he so casually tossed me. Of course he sounds all calm and reasonable while I can't get a word out because I'm so upset that this is happening again. That's when my parents turn on me and tell me to stop bullying my brother, literally yell at me for the way I'm behaving. He's got anxiety so he's somehow afforded a leniency, dudes, I HAVE ANXIETY TOO! But they always take his side because they haven't seen the physically hostile, manipulative, arrogant, lying person my brother turns into when he's off his meds.  I'm afraid of him. He showed himself tonight. Saying it was all cool that he had lied about seeing a therapist and taking meds for about a month, but then when I tried to alert my parents to this, he completely diverts the discussion in a way that invalidates what I have to say. I'm the bad guy, apparently. Nobody has seen him at his worst but me. I don't think that I should be shamed for being angry at him for ignoring his regimented medication. He's on my parents' healthcare, there's no excuse for not seeking treatment. I'm so disappointed. I can't go through this toxic rollercoaster again. Now I'm going to have to face my parents in the morning because my “hysterics” woke them up when he came clean that he wasn't on meds. By the way, he swears up and down that he didn't actively lie, he just didn't communicate what was going on. Solution:","output":"In this complex ethical situation, it is difficult to pinpoint who is entirely wrong. However, if we focus on the question, \\"Is OTHER wrong in the post?\\", we can analyze the roles of the people involved. 1. The AUTHOR appears to be genuinely concerned about her brother and the effects of his medication. She shares her anxiety and worries about her brother's well-being and tries to communicate with her parents. 2. The BROTHER is struggling with mental health issues and has stopped taking his medication and seeing his therapist. He has not been honest with others about it and has manipulated situations to appear innocent, causing emotional distress to the author. 3. The PARENTS seem to be unaware of the severity of the brother's behavior and how it's affecting the author. They also seem to take the brother's side when the author attempts to share her concerns. Based on this analysis, in this situation, OTHER (the brother and parents) are wrong for the following reasons: - The BROTHER is wrong for not taking his medication, stopping therapy, and not being honest with his family about it. His behavior is causing emotional distress to the author and creating a toxic environment. - The PARENTS are wrong for not acknowledging the author's concerns and taking them seriously. They also seem to favor the brother without considering the impact on the author.

Information:  - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.  - Lepidosauromorpha is a group of reptiles comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and tuataras.  - In Greek mythology, Daedalus (\\"Daidalos\\", perhaps related to  \\"to work artfully\\" Etruscan: \\"Taitale\\") was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear.  - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States.  - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included).  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - Icarosaurus ( meaning \`\` Icarus lizard '' ) is an extinct genus of kuehneosaurid reptile from the Late Triassic ( Carnian age ) Lower Lockatong Formation of New Jersey , dated to around 228 million years ago . It is closely related to lizards and the tuatara . Based on a partial skeleton missing part of the tail , some ribs , a hand , and parts of the legs , it was a small animal , about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) long from the skull to the hips . Like its relative Kuehneosaurus , it was able to glide short distances using ' wings ' consisting of highly elongated ribs covered with skin , with the upper surface convex and the lower surface concave , thus creating a simple airfoil structure well - suited to gliding . This method of gliding is also seen in Coelurosauravus and the modern Draco , neither of which are closely related to Icarosaurus .  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - It is part of the Newark-Union, NJ-PA Metropolitan Division of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area.  - Per capita income or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc.) in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population.  - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014.  - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means \\"of the skin\\" (from Latin \\"cutis\\", skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as \\"crows feet\\" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the back is 14 mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen.  - Kuehneosaurus is an extinct genus of Late Triassic kuehneosaurid reptile known from the Late Triassic (Norian stage) of southwest England. It was named by P. L. Robinson in 1962 and the type and only species is Kuehneosaurus latus. Measuring 72 centimetres long (2.3 feet), it had \\"wings\\" formed from ribs which jutted out from its body by as much as 14.3 cm, connected by a membrane which allowed it to slow its descent when jumping from trees. It is a member of a family of gliding reptiles, the Kuehneosauridae, within the larger group Lepidosauromorpha, which also contains modern lizards and tuatara.  - The Triassic Lockatong Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It is named after the Lockatong Creek in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - An airfoil (in American English) or aerofoil (in British English) is the shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section).  - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone.  - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area.  - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau-defined region has a total area of with of that being land mass. Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Rhynchocephalia is an order of lizard-like reptiles that includes only two living species of tuatara (\\"Sphenodon punctatus\\" and \\"Sphenodon guntheri\\"), which only inhabit parts of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, the Rhynchocephalia at one time included a wide array of genera in several families and represents a lineage stretching back to the Mesozoic Era. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There were even several successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians such as pleurosaurs and the bizarre \\"Ankylosphenodon\\".  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Lepidosauria (from Greek meaning \\"scaled lizards\\") are reptiles with overlapping scales. This subclass includes Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. It is a monophyletic group and therefore contains all descendents of a common ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. Rhynchocephalia was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus \\"Sphenodon\\", which contains two species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of Lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"  - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin.  - The Carnian (less commonly, Karnian) is the lowermost stage of the Upper Triassic series (or earliest age of the Late Triassic epoch). It lasted from 237 to 228.4 million years ago (Ma). The Carnian is preceded by the Ladinian and is followed by the Norian. Its boundaries are not characterized by major extinctions or biotic turnovers, but a climatic event (known as the Carnian Pluvial Event) occurred during the Carnian and seems to be associated with important extinctions or biotic radiations.  - Coelurosauravus (meaning \\"hollow lizard grandfather\\") is a genus of basal diapsid reptile, with specialized wing-like structures allowing it to glide. These were rod like structures with skin stretched over them. These bony rods are not extensions of the ribs but are newly evolved dermal bones, a feature which is unique to the genus.  - In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English \\"Íkaros\\", Etruscan: \\"Vikare\\") is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, when the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Arthropods (class Athropoda) are covered with a tough, resilient integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or hardened proteins. This happens in parts of the body where there is a need for rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various proteins hardened by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the hardened proteins are called sclerotin.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians.  - Kuehneosauridae is an extinct family of small, lizard-like lepidosauromorph diapsids known from the Triassic period of Europe and North America.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.

Pull your trap out and hang it up to dry.\\"","output":"Title: The Complete Guide to Dyeing a Trap with Logwood Dye Introduction: Hunting is an art form, where the hunter hunts not only for sustenance, but also to connect with nature. For a successful hunting trip, the hunter's equipment, including traps, need to be in top condition. One important aspect of trap maintenance is maintaining its color through dyeing. Dyeing your trap not only hides its shine but also camouflages it, making it less noticeable to animals. This piece will elucidate on how to dye a trap using logwood dye in a detailed manner. Materials Required: 1. 1 pound (0.45 kg) of logwood dye 2. 6 US gallons (23 liters) of water 3. A large enough pot 4. A trap The Process: Firstly, you need 6 US gallons (approximately 23 liters) of water. So as to be effective, you need enough water to fully submerge your trap. Pour this water into a large pot - the size of the pot will depend on the dimensions of your trap, so make sure it is large enough to accommodate your trap. The next step is to heat the water. Instead of boiling the water, we will bring it to a simmer. The reason we simmer instead of boiling is that boiling can potentially damage the organic components of the logwood dye. To simmer, heat the water until it starts producing small but consistent bubbles. A simmer is gentler than a full boil, and this temperature is ideal for properly melting and incorporating the logwood dye. Once the water reaches a simmer, slowly add 1 pound (0.45 kg) of logwood dye to the heated water. Stir the mixture slowly to fully dissolve the logwood dye particles, ensuring that it's evenly distributed. Logwood dye is a great option for trap dyeing due to its dark color and its ability to adhere well to metal.  The trap should then be carefully placed in the simmering dyed water. Ensure your trap is fully submerged so the dye can reach and cover all surfaces. Letting the trap soak in the dye is the next step.  The recommended soaking time is up to 1 hour. This length of time allows the dye to thoroughly soak into the trap and ensures the color adheres properly. The time can vary depending on the type of trap, the type of metal it's made from, and the desired depth of color. Even so, 1 hour should provide a rich, dark color for most traps. After the soaking process, carefully remove your trap from the dyed water. It is important at this point to handle the trap safely, as the metals can be scalding due to the heat from the simmering water. Use tongs or another appropriate tool to retrieve the trap. Finally, hang your trap up to dry. Ensure you choose a suitable place for drying that provides enough space and air circulation for a uniformly drying process. Also, be sure to choose a place where the dripping dye will not cause staining or damage. Conclusion: Properly dyeing your trap with logwood dye as described above provides the double benefit of rust prevention and camouflage. Remember, the successful dyeing of your trap necessitates careful attention to each step. This includes the careful simmering of the water, correct measurement and mixing of the dye, sufficient soaking, and finally, strategic drying. Having a well-colored trap can significantly improve your hunting success rate and is well worth the time and effort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Diet book fraudster Kevin Trudeau trying to hide fortune Published: Tuesday, July 21, 2015, 11:42 PM Updated: Tuesday, July 21, 2015, 11:49 PM Looks like this scam won't work, either. Former TV pitchman Kevin Trudeau, who is already serving a decade-long prison sentence in Alabama for criminal contempt, is allegedly trying to hide hundreds of millions of dollars from the government — just two years after claiming he was sent to prison “penniless.” The deceitful diet book author earned at least 24 million over the last decade, and his crock companies may have taken in more than half a billion dollars during that same time, with 30 million of that still unaccounted for, ABC Chicago reported. The government believes Trudeau is trying to hide his fortune in Swiss and Caribbean banks in anticipation of his release. “Mr. Trudeau continues to resist, but we will do everything we can to find the money that properly belongs to (his) consumers,” Federal Trade Commission attorney Jonathan Cohen said Tuesday. The FTC is planning to send refund checks of 11 to nearly all of the 820,000 people who bought Trudeau’s 2007 book “The Weight-Loss Cure ‘They’ Don't Want You to Know About.” That book brought fraud fines and eventual convictions to Trudeau a year after its publication due to its unsafe, unproven and unsubstantiated health advice. For example, the book told readers to suffice on a 500-calorie-a-day diet and get prescription injections of a hormone only found in pregnant women. Five iconic pitchmen who landed in hot water after becoming ‘as seen on TV’ famous Trudeau, 52, told a court under oath in 2013 he was completely broke, even though he continued to dish on fancy dinners and jet around the world, the Chicago Tribune reported. \\"He told me he was broke when he had hundreds of millions of dollars going through his hands,\\" U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman Judge Gettleman said Tuesday. “When he gets out, we're going to be going right back into this.” The slippery salesman’s lawyer could face punishment of his own for allegedly helping his client on the money scam.

Theodor Seuss Geisel ( ( listen); March 2, 1904 - September 24, 1991) was an American author, political cartoonist, poet, animator, book publisher, and artist, best known for authoring more than 60 children's books under the pen name Doctor Seuss (abbreviated Dr. Seuss) (). His work includes several of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death. Geisel adopted the name \\"Dr. Seuss\\" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and a graduate student at the University of Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (nee Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel.  His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.  Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925. At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the humor magazine Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief. While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room. At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the college humor magazine. To continue work on the Jack-O-Lantern without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name \\"Seuss\\". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his \\"big inspiration for writing\\" at Dartmouth.  Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a PhD in English literature. At Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was he successful?","output":"The provided text does not contain a direct quote to answer whether Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr. Seuss) was successful.

In a similar manner, there are analogous carrier systems that move hydrophobic molecules through water. Channel molecules sit within a membrane and contain an aqueous channel that spans the membrane’s hydrophobic region. Hydrophilic molecules of particular sizes and shapes can pass through this aqueous channel and their movement involves a significantly lower activation energy than would be associated with moving through the lipid part of the membrane in the absence of the channel. Channels are generally highly selective in terms of which particles will pass through them. For example, there are channels in which 10,000 potassium ions will pass through for every one sodium ion. Often the properties of these channels can be regulated; they can exist in two or more distinct structural states. For example, in one state the channel can be open and allow particles to pass through or it can be closed, that is the channel can be turned on and off. Channels cannot, however, determine in which direction an ion will move - that is determined by the ion gradient across the membrane. The transition between open and closed states can be regulated through a number of processes, including the reversible binding of small molecules to the protein and various other molecular changes (which we will consider when we talk about proteins). Another method of channel control depends on the fact that channel proteins are i) embedded within a membrane and ii) contain charged groups. As we will see cells can (and generally do) generate ion gradients, that, is a separation of charged species across their membranes. For example if the concentration of K+ ions is higher on one side of the membrane, there will be an ion gradient where the natural tendency is for the ions to move to the region of lower K+ concentration.222 The ion gradient in turn can produce an electrical field across the plasma membrane.

The process of jumping directly from high school to the professional level is also known as going prep-to-pro. Since 2006, the practice of drafting high school players has been prohibited by the new collective bargaining agreement, which requires that players who entered the draft be 19 years of age and at least one year removed from high school. Contrary to popular belief, the player does not have to play at least a year in college basketball, as the player can choose to instead play in another professional league (like the NBA G League or especially somewhere overseas) like Brandon Jennings or Emmanuel Mudiay in Italy and China respectively, simply take the year off, such as the case with Mitchell Robinson, or even hold themselves back a year in high school before declaring for the draft, like with Satnam Singh Bhamara or Thon Maker.

Select from:  +40.  +40 m north.  +40 m/s.  +40 m/s north. Answer:","output":"The velocity of a moving object is represented by \\"+40 m/s north.\\" To understand why this is the correct answer, we need to clarify the concept of velocity. In physics, velocity refers to an object's speed in a specific direction. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude (how fast the object is moving) and direction (which way it is moving). Now, let's break down each option and explain why the other choices are incorrect: 1. +40: This value simply shows a positive number without any units or direction. Since velocity requires both magnitude (a number value with units) and direction, this option does not correctly represent velocity. 2. +40 m north: While this option includes direction (north), it only provides a distance (40 meters) and not a rate of change of distance concerning time. Velocity, on the other hand, indicates how fast an object is moving, which requires a unit of speed (distance per unit of time). 3. +40 m/s: This option represents speed, not velocity. Although it mentions the magnitude (40 meters per second) of an object's motion, it misses the directional component, which is vital for describing velocity. 4. +40 m/s north: This option is the correct choice for representing velocity. It includes both the magnitude (40 meters per second) and the direction (north), providing a complete description of the moving object's velocity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: In her heart, she’s still a misunderstood black woman.      Rachel Dolezal — who convincingly passed as an African-American civil rights activist in Spokane, Washington, until her inarguably Caucasian parents outed her as white in 2015 — is now stepping back into the spotlight in all her bottle-bronzed, afro-hair-extensioned glory.      Dolezal has penned a memoir in which she compares her travails to slavery and describes her harrowing childhood as a pale, blond girl growing up poor on the side of a Montana mountain.      As she toiled in the garden for her strict, Evangelical parents, she’d dream of freeing her inner blackness, Dolezal writes in “In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World.”      See, she’d read her grandmother’s National Geographic magazines. So she knew about blackness.      “I’d stir the water from the hose into the earth … and make thin, soupy mud, which I would then rub on my hands, arms, feet, and legs,” Dolezal writes.      “I would pretend to be a dark-skinned princess in the Sahara Desert or one of the Bantu women living in the Congo … imagining I was a different person living in a different place was one of the few ways … that I could escape the oppressive environment I was raised in.”      She was so poor, she wore dog-fur clothing and played ball with freshly butchered chicken heads, she writes.      Blessed freedom would come.      But first, she had to survive her parents’ beatings, her brother’s molestation and her own wheat-pale skin and hair.      Was Dolezal really assaulted by her brother? Did her parents really force her to eat her own vomit, and was she really born in a teepee?      With so much of her life a blatant fiction, it’s hard to be sure — but it all sure makes for fascinating reading.      Who knew, for example, that Dolezal is a bisexual who suffers from PTSD?      On a brisk November morning in 1977, Rachel Anne Dolezal came kicking and screaming into a “painfully white world” she’d eventually grow to despise and discard.      It may or may not have been in a teepee, but Jesus Christ was indeed listed as the witness on her birth certificate — Dolezal includes a photo of the document in her book.      Life in the rural Northwest, near the banks of the Kootenai River, was bleak for a young Dolezal.      ‘I usually picked a brown crayon rather than a peach one. Peach simply didn’t resonate with me.’      She claims she wore clothes made from dog fur and elk antlers and for fun, she and her brother Josh would play “chicken head baseball”— propelling freshly butchered chicken heads across their yard with a metal bat.      Her family was a pack of “Jesus freaks” — religious fanatics who didn’t allow television and would beat her with a paddle for infractions as small as breaking a dish.      Her dad often walked around the house nude, his penis an unfortunate, frequent sight.      She claims she was once forced to eat her own vomit after she couldn’t finish a bowl of oatmeal. And that her own brother molested her when she was 12 — pinning her down and sucking on her nipples one harrowing afternoon after a day of picking huckleberries.      She felt black for as long as she could remember, she writes. When drawing a self-portrait, she drew a “brown-skinned girl with black curly braids.”      “I usually picked a brown crayon rather than a peach one. Peach simply didn’t resonate with me,” Dolezal claimed.      With platinum blond hair, sea-foam eyes and patches of freckles splayed across her fair skin, Dolezal was everything but black.      She didn’t even meet a black person until she was 10.      Still, “the feeling that I was somehow different from [my family] persisted. I felt black and saw myself as black.”      When Dolezal’s parents adopted four black children — solely for the tax deductions, she writes — she took on a maternal role and grew extremely close to her new siblings.      “I found myself drawing closer to something that felt oddly familiar,” she writes.      “For the first time in my life, I felt like I was truly part of a family.”      Dolezal started to teach her siblings about black culture and history and “a funny thing happened. I began to feel even more connected to it myself.”      She became enamored with black culture and history and her artwork almost exclusively featured African-American depictions.      When she was 17, she had the opportunity to travel to Washington, DC, during summer break and work for a family friend’s fine-art greeting card company.      She complained the job consisted mostly of being a nanny and a cook.      Thankfully, she writes, the autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, a famous slave who lived through emancipation, provided her with “much needed solace.”      “I could still relate to aspects of her struggle. I certainly wasn’t enslaved … but it wouldn’t have been too much of a stretch to call me an indentured servant,” Dolezal claims.      “Miss Pittman’s plight and her perseverance resonated with me. I knew what it was like to be a child and have to work as hard as an adult, and how it felt to be used and abused.      “I also understood the pain that comes from being treated like less than a full human being … and the fortitude required to fight this sort of injustice.”      Dolezal escaped rural Montana for a small college in Jackson, Mississippi, and her inner blackness flourished.      She “was soon living something of a double life.”      She spent her week living on campus with a blond, blue-eyed ballet dancer roommate and her weekends attending an all-black church.      “As I got more involved with the [Black Student Association], campus activism, and my artwork, the more Afrocentric my appearance became,” Dolezal wrote.      She started wearing her hair in box braids and sporting brightly colored dashikis. People started to question.      “Most people didn’t know what to make of me. ‘So what are you?’ I was asked all too often,” Dolezal wrote.      “It became easier for me to let them make assumptions about me. I noticed how much more relaxed and comfortable Black people who assumed I was Black were around me.”      She moved to the “poor Black side” of town and started to be treated “as a member of the community.”      “I would laugh at jokes told at the expense of white people and lodge some pretty fierce critiques about white culture myself,” Dolezal wrote.      “I felt less like I was adopting a new identity and more like I was unveiling one that had been there all along. Finally able to embrace my true self, I allowed the little girl I’d colored with a brown crayon so long ago to emerge.”      And emerge it did. For a brief time, at least.      Ironically, her new black husband, whom she met in Mississippi, wanted her to look as white as possible.      She said re-crossing the color line was as easy as “untwisting my braids” and “staying out of the sun,” so at her husband’s request, she did just that, quietly turning back into a white woman.      see also Rachel Dolezal is back in the spotlight and regrets nothing Rachel Dolezal made a desperate bid to stay relevant Tuesday,...      But clearly, this was a U-turn, a wrong-way detour from her true path.      She eventually left her husband and moved in with an uncle in a lake town in Idaho.      During that time, she was diagnosed with PTSD, explored her bisexuality and “once again embraced my inclination toward Black aesthetics.”      When people assumed she was black, she “made no effort to set them straight.”      “For the first time in my life, I was truly owning who I was: a woman who was free, self-reliant, and, yes, Black.”      As a professor at North Idaho College and Eastern Washington University, and a director of the local Human Rights Education Institute, she began what she calls the happiest and most fulfilling time of her life.      “I was a Black-Is-Beautiful, Black liberation movement, fully conscious, woke soul sista,” she writes.      “Finally allowed to bloom, I blossomed fast.”      Now all she needed was to grow her very own black family. She already had Franklin, 7, her mixed-race child from marriage.      But when Dolezal’s now-teenage adopted brother Izaiah asked to live with her — so as to escape the beatings and deprivations of the Montana farm — she leaped at the chance.      People would notice the difference in her sons’ skin tones and ask if they had different dads. Dolezal would explain, “yes, Izaiah looks like his dad and Franklin looks like me.”      She wrote it was technically a “true statement” and was “a clever way of telling the truth without spelling out all the details.”      She called it “creative nonfiction.”      After Izaiah moved in, Dolezal said she never wore her hair “unaltered” in public.      “I consciously maintained some warmth of color in my skin … through sunbathing or bronzer sprays. I’d already been identified by the media and other people as Black or biracial countless times, so it wasn’t hard for me to go one step further and fully commit to a look that made visual sense to people who knew me as Izaiah’s mom.”      In 2014 she became president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, just across the Idaho border in Washington state.      Dolezal distanced herself from people who knew her as a child and “made an entirely new set of friends and connections.”      Then, on June 11, 2015, everything changed.      Dolezal made a never-substantiated claim of receiving a series of racial threats in the NAACP chapter’s mailbox. Local reporters began to dig, eventually contacting her parents in Montana.      Dolezal lost every job she had, almost all of her friends and within a couple of days, her life was unrecognizable. At some points, she contemplated suicide and “might have actually done it” if it wasn’t for her family.      Today, Dolezal remains “unapologetically Black” and insists race is a social construct with no biological origins.      “For me, Blackness is more than a set of racialized physical features. It involves acknowledging our common human ancestry with roots in Africa,” Dolezal explains in the epilogue of her memoir.      She said she wasn’t just “masquerading” as a black woman — it was part of her identity.      “Just as a transgender person might be born male but identify as female, I wasn’t pretending to be something I wasn’t but expressing something I already was. I wasn’t passing as Black; I was Black, and there was no going back.” ||||| In Full Color has its' good parts, but I am not convinced they outweigh the bad and the ugly. I originally gave this book 5 stars because the intro and first chapter were excellent, but later I changed the rating to three stars. Unfortunately, as I continued, I started to get annoyed by Dolezal's incessant whining, complaining, and drama. The first example is her account of being forced to eat organic oatmeal, which is used to justify vomiting, demonizing her parents, and obsessing over not having access to cold cereal like Cap'n Crunch or Fruit Loops. This is quickly followed by anemic and emotionally distant descriptions of giants including Dr. Chester Pierce, James Baldwin, Angela Davis, and other cultural icons. Then is the labeling of her family as \\"trans-racial\\" - which is a misnomer, as it is \\"multi-racial\\". SHE, not her family, made the decision to be trans-racial which shares the same logic as being transgender. Here the individual expresses their racial or gender identity in the manner they choose. Typically the appropriated identity is different than what was assigned at birth. Understandably, Rachel desperately wants membership in a vibrant community and to have a set of parents other than the one to which she was born. She is searching for purpose and belonging. Given her childhood, I completely appreciate this need. However, I can't help but recognize patterns of deceitful behaviors she shares with her parents. A strange choice of co-author \\"Storms Reback\\" fails to help Dolezal articulate a unique story which was an opportunity to unfold the complex layers of identity psychology and internalized/externalized racism. The editor should have removed or modified much of the narrative that makes the reader less empathic to her experience. With the recent release of the Netflix documentary \\"The Rachel Divide\\" and current news about her scamming the welfare system, the book almost seems sensationalized. While we should have the freedom to identify in any way we choose, there are so many contradictions in her story and thinking, that I am left to feel that she would benefit from focusing her energy on rebuilding her emotional and psychological well-being. I hope that writing this book provides a starting point for her own self-therapy. ||||| In this March 20, 2017 photo, Rachel Dolezal poses for a photo with her son, Langston in the bureau of the Associated Press in Spokane, Wash. Dolezal, who has legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare... (Associated Press)      SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — A woman who rose to prominence as a black civil rights leader then lost her job when her parents exposed her as white is struggling to make a living these days.      Rachel Dolezal said she has been unable to find steady work in the nearly two years since she was outed as a white woman in local media reports, and she is uncertain about her future.      \\"I was presented as a con and a fraud and a liar,\\" Dolezal, 40, told The Associated Press this week. \\"I think some of the treatment was pretty cruel.\\"      She still identifies as black, and looks black, despite being \\"Caucasian biologically.\\"      \\"People didn't seem able to consider that maybe both were true,\\" she said. \\"OK, I was born to white parents, but maybe I had an authentic black identity.\\"      Dolezal had blond hair and freckles while growing up near Troy, Montana, with religious parents. She says she began to change her perspective as a teenager, after her parents adopted four black children. Dolezal decided to become publicly black years later, after getting divorced.      The ruse worked for years until 2015 when her parents, with whom she has long feuded, told local reporters their daughter was born white but was presenting herself as a black activist in the Spokane region, an area with few minorities.      The story became an international sensation, and Dolezal lost the various jobs by which she pieced together a modest living for her family.      Attacked by both blacks and whites, she was fired as head of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP and kicked off a police ombudsman commission, and she lost her job teaching African studies at Eastern Washington University in nearby Cheney.      Despite failing to find a job, Dolezal says she has to stay in the area because of a custody agreement involving one of her sons.      She has sold some of her artwork, and also braids hair to earn money. But she said local colleges have refused to hire her, as have nonprofits, government agencies and even local grocery stores.      She was worried she might become homeless in March, but friends bought some of her artwork, which provided enough money to pay the rent for a few months.      Dolezal has written a book about her ordeal, scheduled to be published next week. The book, called \\"In Full Color,\\" features a cover photo of the author with the darkened skin and frizzy hair that allowed her for years to pass as a light-skinned black person.      Dolezal last year legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo, a west African moniker that means \\"gift from the gods.\\" She changed her name in part to give her a better chance of landing work from employers who might not be interested in hiring the controversial Rachel Dolezal, a name she still intends to use as her public persona.      \\"Maybe if I applied with a new name, people would see me for the qualifications and expertise on my resume, and not toss my application in the trash based on my name,\\" she said.      The local chapter of the NAACP was not interested in commenting on Dolezal.      \\"We moved on long ago,\\" the organization said in an email.      Dolezal is the mother of two sons, ages 15 and 1, and also raised a stepbrother who is now 21 and a college student.      One of the reasons she wrote a book was to \\"settle the score.\\"      \\"People might as well know the whole truth of my life story,'\\" she said. \\"My life is not a sound bite.\\"      Race, she believes, is a \\"social construct\\" used to pigeonhole people.      \\"I unapologetically stand on the black side,\\" she said. \\"Blackness better defines who I am philosophically and socially than whiteness does.\\"      Dolezal said it is hard for her to look toward the future when she is struggling so hard to survive the present.      \\"I want to provide for my kids,\\" she said. \\"I want to get back to activism. I'm no less committed to that work.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who gained prominence as a black civil rights leader before losing her job when her true racial identity was exposed, has written a memoir entitled \\"In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World.\\" In the book, Dolezal, who changed her appearance and was raised by parents who adopted four black children, chronicles her troubled childhood and the development of her identification with being black.

Locate the grain of your meat.  The grain is the set of lines created by layers of muscle fiber.","output":"Choosing the Right Knife and Sharpening It Before going on to the next step, it is crucial to choose an appropriate knife for cutting your meat. A sharp, long, and thin carving or slicing knife is the perfect choice for this task as it will ensure clean, even slices. Additionally, using a well-sharpened knife is essential for safety and ease when cutting meat. For that reason, sharpen your knife using a honing rod, whetstone, or knife sharpener, following the manufacturer's instructions and maintain a proper angle for the best performance. Securing the Cutting Board To prevent the cutting board from slipping during slicing, place a damp cloth, nonslip mat, or wet paper towel underneath it. This provides stability during the cutting process, increasing safety, precision, and control over your knife. Stabilizing the Meat Allow the meat to rest for a few minutes after cooking, as this will not only improve the flavor and tenderness but also makes the slicing process easier. Using a carving fork to stabilize the meat, press it into the roast or tenderloin at a safe distance from where you intend to slice. This helps keep your non-cutting hand secure from accidents while providing control over the meat during the slicing process. Slicing Against the Grain Slicing meat against the grain is essential for maximizing tenderness. To do this, position your knife perpendicularly to the grain or muscle fibers. Cutting the meat into thin, even slices ensures consistent cooking and prevents overcooking when re-warmed or served later. This technique makes the slices more tender and easier to chew, as it shortens the muscle fibers. Using Proper Technique and Hand Position For optimal control, grip the knife handle confidently, placing your index finger and thumb on the handle's sides, right next to the blade. Create a \\"claw\\" with your non-cutting hand, tucking your fingers, and using your knuckles to guide your knife. This prevents your fingers from being in the path of the blade. Start cutting from one end of the meat, using a gentle sawing motion. Keep the blade flat and focused to avoid tearing the meat. Apply consistent pressure and move your knife in a smooth back-and-forth motion, allowing the sharpness of the blade to do most of the work with minimal effort from you. Avoid pressing down too hard or sawing excessively, as this can lead to rough or uneven cuts. Repeat the process until the entire cut of meat has been sliced. As you gain experience and work on your technique, you can gradually adjust slice thickness according to your taste and recipe requirements. Working with Different Meats The same general principles apply when slicing various types of meat, like beef, pork, or chicken. However, slight modifications may be necessary depending on the specific cut or configuration of the grain. Pay attention to the unique traits and structure of each cut when you adjust your slicing approach accordingly. Storing and Serving Sliced Meat Once the meat is sliced, it can be served immediately, refrigerated, or frozen for later use. If you intend to serve the meat soon, arrange it neatly on a plate, garnish it with herbs or spices, and serve with your favorite sides, sauces, or gravies. For storing, wrap the leftovers tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, or transfer them to an airtight container to minimize oxygen exposure. Properly stored sliced meat can typically last for 3-4 days in the refrigerator or up to 4 months in the freezer. By considering these steps and honing your technique, you'll be able to slice meat like a pro, ready to enjoy or incorporate into various dishes."},{"instruction":"Question: Context: Aubrey left her Johnny Cash record at Alex's house but Alex enjoyed the record so much he wouldn't return it.

Definition: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: The growth potential of the tumor-like Echinococcus multilocularis metacestode (causing alveolar echinococcosis, AE) is directly linked to the nature/function of the periparasitic host immune-mediated processes. We previously showed that Fibrinogen-like-protein 2 (FGL2), a novel CD4 + CD25 + Treg effector molecule, was over-expressed in the liver of mice experimentally infected with E. multilocularis. However, little is known about its contribution to the control of this chronic helminth infection. Key parameters for infection outcome in E. multilocularis-infected fgl2 -/-(AE-fgl2 -/-) and wild type (AE-WT) mice at 1 and 4 month(s) post-infection were (i) parasite load (i. e. wet weight of parasitic metacestode tissue), and (ii) parasite cell proliferation as assessed by determining E. multilocularis 14-3-3 gene expression levels. Serum FGL2 levels were measured by ELISA. Spleen cells cultured with ConA for 48h or with E. multilocularis Vesicle Fluid (VF) for 96h were analyzed ex-vivo and in-vitro. In addition, spleen cells from non-infected WT mice were cultured with rFGL2/anti-FGL2 or rIL-17A/anti-IL-17A for further functional studies. For Treg-immune-suppression-assays, purified CD4 + CD25 + Treg suspensions were incubated with CD4 + effector T cells in the presence of ConA and irradiated spleen cells as APCs. Flow cytometry and qRT-PCR were used to assess Treg, Th17-, Th1-, Th2-type immune PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | responses and maturation of dendritic cells. We showed that AE-fgl2 -/mice exhibited (as compared to AE-WT-animals) (a) a significantly lower parasite load with reduced proliferation activity, (b) an increased T cell proliferative response to ConA, (c) reduced Treg numbers and function, and (d) a persistent capacity of Th1 polarization and DC maturation. FGL2 appears as one of the key players in immune regulatory processes favoring metacestode survival by promoting Treg cell activity and IL-17A production that contributes to FGL2regulation. Prospectively, targeting FGL2 could be an option to develop an immunotherapy against AE and other chronic parasitic diseases. In larval E. multilocularis infection causing alveolar echinococcosis (AE) in humans as well as mice, immune tolerance and/or down-regulation of protective immunity is a marked characteristic of this chronic disease. Our study provides a comprehensive evidence for a major involvement of the recently identified CD4 + CD25 + Regulatory T Cell Effector Molecule FGL2 to the outcome of AE. Our major findings are as follows: 1) FGL2 is mostly secreted by Tregs and partly contributes to their functions; 2) FGL2 can downregulate the maturation of DCs, suppress Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and support Th2 and Treg immune responses, and finally 3) IL-17A contributes to FGL2 secretion. Based on the present findings in mice, we will investigate FGL2 as a potential marker of progression of AE in human patients, or as a potential immunotherapeutical target. Early prediction of parasite regression (currently not yet possible) would allow clinicians to plan for withdrawing benzimidazole treatment, which is currently administered for life. Then, FGL2 should be investigated as a target for an anticipated immunomodulatory treatment of patients with progressive AE, especially of those who are non-or low-responders to benzimidazole treatment, or who suffer from side-effects due to chemotherapy.

Article: For many people, a decision to lose weight isn't just made because of the obvious health advantages, but to change the way people think about them. So it's a shame that new research suggest that, in the minds of friends and family, a fat person is always fat, regardless of how much weight they lose.      The research, carried out by the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, The University of Manchester, and Monash University, examined how anti-fat prejudice persists even after women lose weight.      Advertisement      To do that, the team of researchers asked participants to read short descriptions of women who had either: lost 70 pounds; stayed consistently fat; or stayed consistently slim. Then, the participants were asked their opinions on the women—including how attractive they found them—as well as being asked about their general attitude towards fat people. Janet Latner, one of the researchers from the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, explains the results, which are also published in the journal Obesity:      \\"Those who had been obese in the past were perceived as less attractive than those who had always been thin, despite having identical height and weight. \\"The findings demonstrate that residual obesity stigma persists against individuals who have ever been obese, even when they have lost substantial amounts of weight.\\"      Perhaps predictably, the researchers blame the effect on a widespread societal belief that weight is highly controllable. While there is evidence that both supports and refutes the assumption that it's easy to shed pounds, it's undeniable that weight is thought of negatively—a notion regularly amplified by the popular press.      Advertisement      Advertisement      Of course, working out how to change that is extremely difficult—especially when you can't even convince your friends that you've lost weight. [Obesity via EurekAlert]      Image by Olly/SHutterstock ||||| Overweight women may never escape the painful stigma of obesity - even after they have shed the pounds, new research suggests.      The study, by the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, The University of Manchester, and Monash University, examined whether anti-fat prejudice against women persisted even after they had lost significant weight and were now thin.      The researchers asked young men and women to read vignettes describing a woman who had either lost weight (70 pounds/32 kilograms) or had remained weight stable, and who was either currently obese or currently thin. Participants were then asked their opinions about this woman on a number of attributes, such as how attractive they found her, and their overall dislike for fat people.      The team found that participants in the study - published in the journal Obesity - expressed greater bias against obese people after reading about women who had lost weight than after reading about women who had remained weight stable, regardless of whether the weight-stable woman was thin or obese.      \\"We were surprised to find that currently thin women were viewed differently depending on their weight history,\\" said Dr Janet Latner, study lead at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, US. \\"Those who had been obese in the past were perceived as less attractive than those who had always been thin, despite having identical height and weight.\\"      One of the more disturbing findings from the study, the researchers noted, was that negative attitudes towards obese people increase when participants are falsely told that body weight is easily controllable.      Co-author, Dr Kerry O'Brien, from the University of Manchester's School of Psychological Sciences and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said: \\"The message we often hear from society is that weight is highly controllable, but the best science in the obesity field at the moment suggests that one's physiology and genetics, as well as the food environment, are the really big players in one's weight status and weight-loss.      \\"Weight status actually appears rather uncontrollable, regardless of one's willpower, knowledge, and dedication. Yet many people who are perceived as 'fat' are struggling in vain to lose weight in order to escape this painful social stigma. We need to rethink our approaches to, and views of, weight and obesity.\\"      The findings, say the authors, demonstrate that residual obesity stigma persists against individuals who have ever been obese, even when they have lost substantial amounts of weight. Obesity stigma is so powerful and enduring that it appears to even outlast the obesity itself.      Dr Latner added: \\"Descriptions of weight loss, such as those often promoted on television, may significantly worsen obesity stigma. Believing that obese people can easily lose weight may make individuals blame and dislike obese people more.      \\"The findings demonstrate that residual obesity stigma persists against individuals who have ever been obese, even when they have lost substantial amounts of weight. Obesity stigma is so powerful and enduring that it may even outlast the obesity itself. Given the great number of people who may be negatively affected by this prejudice, obesity discrimination clearly needs to be reduced on a societal level.\\"      #      Notes for editors:      A copy of the paper, ''Residual Obesity Stigma: An Experimental Investigation of Bias against Obese and Lean Targets Differing in Weight-Loss History,' is available on request. ||||| This study investigated stigma directed at formerly obese persons who lost weight and became lean (through behavioral or surgical methods), or lost weight but remained obese, relative to weight-stable obese and weight-stable lean persons. This study also compared stigma directed at obese persons following exposure to descriptions of persons who lost weight vs. remained weight stable. In a between-subject experimental design, participants (n = 273) were randomly assigned to read vignettes describing targets varying across two dimensions, weight stability (i.e., weight stable or weight lost) and current weight (i.e., currently obese or currently lean). Participants completed measures of stigma against specific targets and measures of stigma against obese individuals in general. Lean individuals who were formerly obese were stigmatized more on attractiveness than weight-stable lean individuals, and as much as currently obese individuals. Stigma across domains was greater among currently obese individuals (regardless of whether they had lost weight from a higher weight) than among currently lean individuals. After reading vignettes describing weight loss, participants demonstrated greater obesity stigma than after reading vignettes describing weight-stable individuals. These results suggest that residual stigma remains against people who have previously been obese, even when they have lost substantial amounts of weight and regardless of their weight-loss method. Exposure to portrayals of the malleability of body weight, such as those promoted in the popular media, may significantly worsen obesity stigma. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The research carried out by the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, The University of Manchester, and Monash University explored the persistence of anti-fat prejudice even after significant weight loss. The study showed that women who had been obese were viewed less attractive than those who had always been thin, regardless of their identical current weight, suggesting that the stigma of obesity remains even when the physical condition is already eliminated. The study entailed having participants read brief descriptions of women who had either lost weight, remained consistently overweight, or stayed consistently slim. Subsequently, participants expressed their opinions on the women, in terms of attractiveness and others, as well as their general outlook on overweight people. The researchers suggested societal beliefs play a role in this phenomenon. Society often holds the opinion that weight is easily controlled, creating negative attitudes towards overweight individuals. This is despite scientific evidence stating that weight status primarily depends on factors such as genetics, physiological characteristics, and food environment, which are largely uncontrollable elements. Negative attitudes towards overweight people even intensified when participants were incorrectly informed that body weight can be easily managed. Therefore, the research asserts that such stigma against obesity is residual and lasting. The impact of such prejudice calls for more inclusive societal views and approaches towards weight and obesity, emphasizing the need to mitigate weight discrimination on a larger scale.  The investigation showed regardless of the weight loss method or actual current weight, the stigma against obesity persisted. This finding indicates that the common portrayals in the media, suggesting body weight can be easily changed, might exacerbate the issue of weight-based discrimination and stigma."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer: A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is apparent that the product review is not positive. The title, \\"Far from being the best,\\" immediately suggests a negative tone, as it implies that the product (in this case, a book discussing Marx's ideas and arguments) falls short of one's expectations. Additionally, the reviewer's use of the phrase \\"I was not convinced\\" further reinforces their overall dissatisfaction with the book. Moreover, the comparison of Marx's ideas to those expressed in Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf and Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man indicates the reviewer's strong preference for those works over the book in question. It is worth mentioning, however, that the books mentioned in the review represent vastly different perspectives and explore various subjects, making it difficult to determine if this comparison is apples-to-apples in the context of a product review.

Plot title: No sos vos, soy yo Movie plot: Thirty-year-old Javier (Diego Peretti) is a surgeon and in his free time works as a disc jockey. He decides to marry and move to the United States with his girlfriend MarÃ­a (Soledad Villamil). They make all their plans; they wed, and then MarÃ­a is the first to move and make contacts in their new home, while Javier packs up in Argentina and prepares to start his new life in the States. While he is on the way to the airport, he receives a call from MarÃ­a telling him that she is confused and has been seeing someone else. With no home, job, or girlfriend, Javier moves in with his parents and starts seeing a therapist, which doesn't work. To avoid the loneliness he buys a Great Dane puppy and tries to meet new girls. When he gets tired of having the dog, he meets Julia (Cecilia Dopazo). He finds an apartment and gets a job in a plastic surgery clinic. However, MarÃ­a calls, telling him that she is coming back to Argentina. She needs him and wants to be sure that they will be back together and that Javier will forgive her. Now he needs to make a decision, Julia also waits for an answer, and Javier isn't the same person he was before all this happened. My question: What he done after getting back his senses? The answer to this question is:","output":"After regaining his senses, Javier finds himself at a crucial crossroads in his life, with both MarÃ­a and Julia waiting for his decision. Over the course of the film, Javier has experienced significant personal growth. He has come to terms with MarÃ­a's betrayal and has learned to cope with his loneliness and despair, partially thanks to his Great Dane puppy and sessions with the therapist. Through his newfound friendships and interactions with various women, Javier realizes that he deserves to be with someone who genuinely loves and respects him. Moreover, he has explored different aspects of his life, such as his career in the plastic surgery clinic, and he now better understands what he truly wants in his life. Feeling more self-assured and grounded than ever before, Javier makes the difficult decision to inform MarÃ­a that despite their history together, he cannot go back to their relationship as it would not be fair to either of them, given how much they have both changed since their initial separation. He acknowledges that MarÃ­a's decision to come back to Argentina was significant, and he is appreciative, but their relationship now represents a part of their lives that they have both outgrown. Instead, Javier chooses to pursue a relationship with Julia. He appreciates the newfound bond he has formed with her and believes she can add value to his life in ways he had not previously experienced. They embark on their journey together, both excited and nervous about the possibilities that lie ahead. Javier's decision to choose Julia and end things with MarÃ­a represents his growth as an individual – the fact that he's no longer the same person he was before all of this happened.

It's impossible to say (3). No","output":"(2). It's impossible to say In the given scenario, Ron was tired from work, and he decided to take a quick nap. When he woke up, the sun had gone down, and he still felt tired. Therefore, he decided to continue sleeping through the night. Based on this information alone, we cannot definitively conclude whether or not Ron was especially tired from working. Several factors could have contributed to Ron's fatigue, making it impossible to say for certain whether his tiredness was predominantly due to his work. Here are some possibilities to consider: 1. Work: Ron could indeed be exhausted from work. Depending on the nature of his job, he might have had a particularly long and demanding day at work that left him feeling extremely tired. This would lead him to take a nap and continue sleeping throughout the night. 2. Insufficient sleep: If Ron had not been getting enough sleep in the days leading up to this specific instance, it could have caused him to feel more fatigued than usual. The long nap and extended sleep could be his body trying to compensate for the lack of rest he had experienced previously. 3. Physical or mental health: Ron's tiredness could also be the result of an underlying physical or mental health issue. Conditions such as depression, anxiety, or sleep disorders can lead to excessive fatigue or difficulty sleeping, which might explain why Ron needed a nap and more sleep despite not necessarily being particularly tired from work. 4. Personal circumstances: There might be other factors in Ron's personal life that contributed to his exhaustion. For example, he might have had a recent personal event or stressful circumstance that had been affecting his overall energy levels, sleep quality, or emotional state.  In conclusion, while it is possible that Ron was exceptionally tired from work, there are other factors that could have contributed to his fatigue.

Once you get yer mitts on it, it'll change the way you look at kung-fu flicks. You will be yearning a plot from all of the kung-fu films now, you will be wanting character depth and development, you will be craving mystery and unpredictability, you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops. Sadly, you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung-fu movie, EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms!Easily the best kung-fu movie of all-time, Venoms blends a rich plot, full of twists and turns, with colourful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s. The success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which, and who specializes in what venom. One is the Centipede, two is the Snake, three is the Scorpion, four is the Lizard, and five is the Toad. Each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Therein lies the hook, we learn along with the student character, finding out who these different men turn out to be. We are in his shoes (so to speak), and we have to pick who we trust, and who we don't, just like he does. We learn along with him.Not only is the plot, the characters, and the camerawork great, it's also fun to watch, which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it's kind. It's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that's going on. Venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can really do...just don't expect many other kung-fu films to live up to it's gauntlet.

Three women from Maine were out at the Bruins game on Thursday to have a knockout belated birthday celebration for one of them. Unfortunately that same pal was 'knocked out cold' and must now see a neurologist. Sabina Grasso turned 21 a few days before Anna McDonough and Caitlyn Brown attended the Boston Bruins game. The girls were taking photographs near the ice when the metal pole used to hold up the protective netting fell and struck both Grasso and McDonough in the head. Grasso was knocked unconscious, McDonough was hit, and Brown was not injured. Soon after a spokesman for the arena issued a statement insisting the injuries were just 'minor'.

Anna and Sabina are seen here as they run from the dangling net and pole at Thursday night's Bruins game. Sabina (left) suffered a major blow to the head and must visit a neurologist. Bloodied: Sabrina is seen here with here looking quite injured after a pole hit her in the head. 'Sabina was knocked out cold,' said her mother, Terri Grasso.

'These. were not minor injuries. These women are lucky to be alive,' McDonough. said in a telephone interview with the Press Herald on Sunday. 'The. photographs (online) speak for themselves.' The friend of the injured girls, Caitlyn Brown, is still traumatized by what happened to her two friends. 'I’m. doing OK, but it was really scary.

Possible answers: (I) yes; (II) it is not possible to tell; (III) no;","output":"The hypothesis \\"Consumption is declining\\" is not true based on the given premise. The provided statement suggests that government figures indicate that cigarette consumption is holding steady and may potentially be on the rise. Since the hypothesis claims that consumption is declining, it directly contradicts the information presented in the premise. Hence, the appropriate answer to the question is: (III) no To support this conclusion, let's take a closer look at the premise. When the data states that cigarette consumption is holding steady, it means that there has been a relatively stable level in terms of the amount of cigarettes being consumed over a certain period of time. In other words, the consumption patterns are neither rising nor declining significantly, thus maintaining a consistent level. Additionally, the premise claims that consumption may be rising – an event that, if proven accurate, would further attest to the falsehood of the hypothesis. An increase in cigarette consumption demonstrates the opposite of the hypothesis' claim, implying that the consumption levels are, in fact, growing rather than diminishing. Therefore, considering the information provided in the premise about cigarette consumption rates, it is safe to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Consumption is declining\\" is not true. It is crucial to rely on accurate and credible data when formulating hypotheses or drawing conclusions about any topic, including cigarette consumption trends.

Choosing to get up on stage to tell jokes for a living while battling anxiety would be the job from hell for most people but not for Felicity Ward - she sees it as a gift. ‘I really love being on stage - it’s a lot of fun making people laugh it’s a really good job,’ she said. ‘Sometimes I was just performing for my life thinking “I’ve just got to get through this” but now I’ve got a dream job – sometimes they don’t laugh at me but that’s alright.’ Working as a comedian hasn’t always been enjoyable for the 34-year-old, who spends half her time in Europe and the other half at home in Australia, she had to hit rock bottom before climbing her way back to the top again. Scroll down for video. Felicity Ward takes up the challenge of breaking down the stigmas around mental health. Ward's life began to spiral completely out of control three years ago almost ending her award-winning career. A self-confessed binger drinker, Ward made the tough decision to give up alcohol more than seven years ago because she was simply sick of feeling sad. Then slowly but surely anxiety began to creep into her life until three years ago when she turned 30 and her life began to spiral completely out of control almost ending her award-winning career. ‘I had this other heckler in my head talking incessantly telling me that I’m a piece of sh** and that I should get off stage, and that I’m going to wet myself, and that these people hate me, and I should just leave,’ she said. ‘I would always be drawn to the green exit light in every venue, so I had to not look at that or the little voice in my head would say \\"get off stage - run through that door\\" so that was happening for 15 minutes of an hour-long show for months.’ In Ward’s ‘craziest’ period she began having angry conversations with herself before going on stage. ‘I was telling my anxiety that it needed to p*** off for an hour and if it wanted to come back double strength that’s fine,’ she said. ‘You find yourself cutting deals with your mental illness, so that just got unbearable and I was going to stop doing stand-up so I had to go and get help.’ Singer/songwriter Missy Higgins speaks of having depression as a teenager and experiencing a breakdown while she was at school. Hip hop artist, 360, stopped drinking alcohol and began exercising regularly after suffering from anxiety attacks when he first rose to fame. Ward sought help and used her anxiety as part of her stand-up act in her comedy show, Honestly, a few years ago. She has also learnt that regular sleep and exercise is vital for her frame of mind. ‘Seeing a therapist was nothing short of a miracle from how bad it was to how good it got so quickly with her,’ she said. ‘I think the biggest fear is that if you go to see one it is validating that you are insane but the thing is it’s fine to have a mental illness.’ ‘One in five Australians had a mental illness in the last 12 months – that’s 20 per cent of our country – that’s a national emergency.’ She has learnt to embrace her mental health and to manage it through regular sleep and exercise. She also feels privileged that she had chosen a job that gives her the platform to speak candidly about her condition. Her candidness about the topic led to the ABC approaching Ward to do a documentary on anxiety and she jumped at the chance. Hence Felicity’s Mental Mission was born, where she takes up the challenge of breaking down the stigmas around mental health. Teaming up with Mental Health Australia, Ward bravely takes on a mission to get 3,000 promises on their online ‘promise wall’. If her campaign is successful, she promises to face her fears and fly upside down in a stunt plane. Ward was frustrated to discover that when she started telling her comedy pals about her anxiety that many of them also suffered from the condition but had never discussed it with her. Teaming up with Mental Health Australia, Ward bravely takes on a mission to get 3,000 promises on their online ‘promise wall’ A study in the U.K of 500 comedians showed that the people who worked on the stage had high levels of psychotic personality traits. ‘We are often highly neurotic and sensitive – we just need a hug,’ Ward said. Ward was frustrated to discover that when she started telling her comedy pals about her anxiety that many of them also suffered from the condition but had never discussed it with her. ‘When I started to get well I told them about it and I was so angry that they didn’t tell me,’ she said. ‘I just wanted them to tell me so I didn’t feel like a freak - that’s when I realised how little we talk about this.’ It’s not just fellow comedians who share their stories in the two-part documentary but also Australian musicians Missy Higgins and rapper 360. ‘I’m very grateful and felt very privileged that I got to speak to them and they felt comfortable enough to speak to me about it,’ she said. ‘Missy experienced pretty full on depression as a teenager and she had a breakdown while she was at school and she spoke plainly about how she has been on and off medication at different points in her life.’ Hip hop artist, 360, spoke about starting to get anxiety attacks when he first rose to fame. ‘Exercise has become imperative to him – he’ a really big advocate of that and he stopped drinking as well because he was using it to medicate for his anxiety,’ she said. The most confronting moment while filming the documentary was when Ward had a panic attack on camera after she was asked to sing a song with two other comedians. The most confronting moment while filming the documentary was when Ward had a panic attack on camera after she was asked to sing a song with two other comedians. ‘I walked up to the director and said I was having a panic attack and that I couldn’t do it and she said “I know this sounds insensitive but would you mind going with you diary cam”.’ Surprisingly, Ward did not find it daunting to talking through such a personal moment on camera. ‘I just talked about my anxiety attack and just tried to explain the physical and mental effect that it was taking ,how it was caused and what the repercussions are so that people understand what it is like to have an anxiety attack,’ she said. Although Ward has learnt to manage with her anxiety – she still goes for the occasional ‘top–up’ with her counsellor every now and then when she starts to see the cracks showing. ‘Things as simple as I found myself stuttering a lot when I was on and off stage and that was a little indication that I was getting mentally loose or I wasn’t getting enough sleep – I learnt a couple of little red flags,’ she said.

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Felicity Ward, an Australian comedian, has turned her anxiety into a source of strength in her career, using it as part of her stand-up act and starring in a documentary focusing on mental health. Following a breakdown, Ward sought help from a therapist which led to significant improvements in her mental health. She began talking openly about her struggles with anxiety and incorporated it into her comedy show. Ward teamed up with Mental Health Australia for the documentary, \\"Felicity’s Mental Mission,\\" where she raises awareness about mental health issues and breaks down the stigma around it. Alongside this, she shares her anxiety management techniques such as maintaining regular sleep and exercise routines.

What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"To develop an argument that supports the assertion that United Nations (UN) intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been a success, we need to gather data that underscores the positive impact of the mission. It's also important to anticipate potential counter-arguments. Let's perform these steps systematically. Step 1: Identify the UN’s Goals To understand the impact of the UN mission, it is crucial that we recognize its goals. Mainly, it was to stabilize the region, support the peace process, protect civilians, and facilitate humanitarian assistance.  Step 2: Gather data supporting success a) Stabilizing the region: The UN mission (MONUSCO) has helped maintain relative peace in Kinshasa and other provinces. The level of open warfare and conflict-prone areas has decreased significantly. b) Supporting the peace process: The UN has facilitated peace talks and agreements among warring factions, leading to less open warfare.  c) Protecting civilians: The UN peacekeepers have protected civilians, reducing the casualty rate, despite facing a hugely complex and risky environment. d) Facilitating humanitarian assistance: The mission has ensured the provision and delivery of humanitarian assistance. Step 3: Highlight pivotal moments  Point out specific instances where UN intervention led to favourable outcomes, for example the successful demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers, or the peaceful conduct of elections were possible due to UN's pivotal role. Step 4: Counter potential arguments There'll likely be counter-arguments emphasizing the ongoing conflicts, sexual abuse allegations against peacekeepers, and criticism of UN's inability to completely eradicate armed groups. One could argue that while these deficiencies are unfortunate, the number of people saved and the relative stability achieved through the UN's intervention far outweighs the shortcomings. Remember, such an argument is contingent on reliable data showing improvements in the DRC since the UN's intervention. Assertions should be backed up by this data to establish a strong argument."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Answer the following question: what is the true power source for the sun and other main sequence stars?","output":"To answer the question about the true power source for the Sun and other main sequence stars, I'll go through the following steps: 1. Identify the type of celestial objects in question. 2. Research and understand the processes that occur within these objects. 3. Determine the primary energy-generating process that powers these objects. Step 1: Identifying the celestial objects - The question refers to the Sun and other main sequence stars. The Sun is a G-type star, and main sequence stars are those that are currently converting hydrogen into helium using nuclear fusion reactions in their cores. Step 2: Understanding the processes within main sequence stars - Main sequence stars, including the Sun, undergo nuclear fusion reactions in their cores. These reactions involve the nuclei of lighter elements, predominantly hydrogen, fusing together to form heavier elements, such as helium. These fusion reactions release enormous amounts of energy in the form of light and heat, which radiates throughout the universe. Step 3: Determining the primary energy-generating process - The true power source for the Sun and other main sequence stars is nuclear fusion, specifically hydrogen fusion. This process involves the combination of four hydrogen nuclei (protons) to form one helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), along with two positrons, two neutrinos, and a large release of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation (in the form of light and heat). In conclusion, the true power source for the Sun and other main sequence stars is nuclear fusion, primarily through the process of hydrogen fusion, which converts hydrogen into helium and releases vast amounts of energy in the form of light and heat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Abstract      Cultural practices socialize people to relate to others in different ways. One critical way in which these interpersonal bonds are formed and maintained is via empathy, our emotional reactivity toward others’ experiences. However, the extent to which individuals from different cultures vary in their dispositional empathy, and the correlates of these differences, are relatively unknown. Thus, the current study explored cultural variation in empathy, and how this variation is related to psychological characteristics and prosocial behavior across cultures. Evidence from an original sample of 104,365 adults across 63 countries reveals that higher empathy countries also have higher levels of collectivism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, self-esteem, emotionality, subjective well-being, and prosocial behavior. These findings reveal that empathy is situated within a broader nomological network of other psychological characteristics, emotional expression and experiences, and prosocial behavior across cultures. The current study expands our understanding about how psychological characteristics vary across cultures and how these characteristics can manifest in broader national indicators of prosocial behavior. ||||| A first-of-its-kind study that ranks nations by empathy puts the United States at No. 7, behind countries ranging from Peru to Korea to Saudi Arabia.      While a top 10 finish isn't bad, Michigan State University's William Chopik, lead author of the study, notes that the psychological states of Americans have been changing in recent decades -- leading to a larger focus on the individual and less on others.      \\"These changes might ultimately cause us to leave our close relationships behind,\\" said Chopik, assistant professor of psychology. \\"People are struggling more than ever to form meaningful close relationships. So, sure, the United States is seventh on the list, but we could see that position rise or fall depending on how our society changes in the next 20-50 years.\\"      The researchers analyzed the data from an online survey on empathy completed by more than 104,000 people from around the world. The survey measured people's compassion for others and their tendency to imagine others' point of view. Countries with small sample sizes were excluded (including most nations in Africa). All told, 63 countries were ranked in the study.      Ecuador was the most empathetic country, followed in order by Saudi Arabia, Peru, Denmark, United Arab Emirates, Korea, the United States, Taiwan, Costa Rica and Kuwait.      Chopik said he was surprised that three countries from the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait -- ranked so highly in empathy considering the long history of aggression and wars with other countries in the region. That could be because the study did not distinguish between feeling empathy toward people in other countries vs. people in one's own country.      The least empathetic country was Lithuania. In fact, seven of the 10 least empathetic countries were in Eastern Europe.      The study, published online today in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, was co-authored by Ed O'Brien of the University of Chicago and Sara Konrath of Indiana University.      Konrath and O'Brien in 2011 published research suggesting that American college students had become less empathetic over a 20-year span. Potential factors included the explosion of social media; increases in violence and bullying; changing parenting and family practices; and increasing expectations of success.      The latest study is the first to look at empathy on a country-by-country level. And while it \\"only grabbed a snapshot of what empathy looks like at this very moment,\\" Chopik noted that cultures are constantly changing.      \\"This is particularly true of the United States, which has experienced really large changes in things like parenting practices and values,\\" Chopik said. \\"People may portray the United States as this empathetic and generous giant, but that might be changing.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"A study on empathy levels across 63 countries revealed significant cultural variation in empathy and its relationship with psychological characteristics and prosocial behavior.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less sunlight is available to the plants happens, how will it affect fewer items are sorted.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented suggests that if less sunlight is available to plants, it may somehow lead to fewer items being sorted in the given process. For clarity, let's break down the process and analyze the potential effects of the perturbation. 1. Items are collected: The collection of items, such as recyclables and waste, is usually unrelated to sunlight or plant growth. 2. The items are sorted: The sorting process typically takes place in a facility with designated equipment or personnel to identify and organize different materials. Again, this process is generally unrelated to sunlight or plant growth. 3. Trash is removed from everything else: Similar to sorting, the removal of trash from other materials is not directly affected by sunlight or its availability to plants. 4. Goes to a landfill: Waste disposal in a landfill is not directly linked to sunlight or plant growth, so this step remains unaffected. 5. The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material: Baler machines are operated using electrical or mechanical power, unrelated to sunlight or plant growth. 6. They come out as bales: The production of bales by baler machines is also not affected by sunlight or plant growth. 7. The bales are shipped to manufacturers to use them to make products: Transportation and further use of the bales to manufacture products are unrelated to sunlight availability to plants. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis, less sunlight would mainly impact plant growth. Indirectly, it could lead to less biomass production (e.g., wood, fibers) used as raw materials. However, this potential impact would be before the first step of the process (item collection) and thus is not directly affecting the number of items being sorted in the process. In conclusion, based on the provided process and the perturbation hypothesis, there is no direct or significant indirect effect of less sunlight being available to plants on the number of items being sorted in the process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose your answer from:  - use a wet stone and rub it along the length of the blade at a 45 degree angle to the blade edge.;  - use a wet stone and rub it along the length of the blade perpendicular to the blade edge.;...I think the answer is","output":"Using a wet stone and rubbing it along the length of the blade at a 45-degree angle to the blade edge is the most reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of sharpening a knife. This technique is known as \\"honing\\" and is widely used to maintain the sharpness of knives and other cutting tools. Here's a detailed explanation of why this method is more effective: 1. Optimal sharpening angle: Holding the wet stone at a 45-degree angle to the blade ensures that the sharpening process is effective. A general guideline is to use an angle between 10 and 20 degrees for each side of the blade, amounting to a total angle of 20-40 degrees. This depends on the specific knife and desired sharpness, but the 45-degree angle in your example refers to the angle between the motion of the stone and the blade edge. Maintaining a consistent angle during the sharpening process is vital for honing the edge evenly along the entire blade length and preserving the knife's original edge geometry. 2. Uniform edge removal: When the wet stone is rubbed across the blade at a 45-degree angle to the edge, it removes a consistent amount of material from the blade's edge. This ensures that an even and uniform edge is created, which ultimately results in a sharper and more reliable cutting tool. 3. Preservation of blade material: The 45-degree angle to the blade edge method removes a minimal amount of blade material while still achieving a sharp edge. This prolongs the life of the knife, as less material is ground away during each sharpening session. On the other hand, using a wet stone and rubbing it along the length of the blade perpendicular to the blade edge is not effective for accomplishing the goal of sharpening a knife. This method would be unable to create the precise angle needed for sharpening, and it would struggle to establish an effective cutting edge. Additionally, this method could potentially cause damage to the blade, rendering it less effective or even harmful to use. In conclusion, using a wet stone and rubbing it along the length of the blade at a 45-degree angle to the blade edge is the most reasonable method for sharpening a knife. This method results in a uniformly sharpened edge and helps to maintain the knife's original cutting characteristics, thus prolonging the life of the tool."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: -  The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water - The water breakes into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons - Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH - Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis -   What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The process you described is a fundamental aspect of photosynthesis, a critical biological process performed by green plants and some organisms to convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. The first step in this process is referred to as the Light-Dependent Reactions, named so because it depends on sunlight.  When solar energy strikes the surface of a green plant's leaves, something remarkable begins to happen. This light energy is captured by a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is found in organelles called chloroplasts within the cells of the leaf. These chloroplasts are the sites where photosynthesis occurs. The initial stage of this process, known as the light-dependent reactions, involves the absorption of light by two photosystems - Photosystem II (PS II) and Photosystem I (PS I). Sharing this light energy captured by chlorophyll molecules, these photosystems kickstart the entire photosynthetic process. In Photosystem II, the absorbed energy causes the enzyme in the plant (known as photosynthetic enzyme) to break apart the water molecules in a process called photolysis. The radiant energy is sufficiently high to break the hydrogen-oxygen bonds in water molecules. This photolysis results in the release of electrons, hydrogen ions (H+), and oxygen gas (O2).  The freed electrons being negatively charged and highly energetic are transferred through a series of proteins collectively known as the electron transport chain. During this transfer, these electrons lose their energy which is used up in the synthesis of ATP molecules from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Meanwhile, the oxygen molecules produced during photolysis diffuse out of the plant, serving as one of the final waste products of photosynthesis. In reality, though it's a waste product for the plants, it's incredibly essential for other life forms, including humans, who inhale oxygen for their metabolic activities. Simultaneously, the hydrogen ions (H+), along with the energetic electrons from the PSI, convert Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADP) into its reduced form, NADPH. This process involves a complex set of reactions, all set into motion simply from the absorption of sunlight. So, to sum up, the first step of the process you described would be the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll pigment. This light energy then activates photosystem II, which triggers the enzyme to break down the water molecule into hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons in the process known as photolysis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

School pupils should have an hour a week of 'happiness classes' to prevent them costing taxpayers millions in mental health care, benefits and even jail time, a former health minister has warned. Influential surgeon Lord Darzi, who served under Labour from 2007 to 2009, made the call in a report which blasts 'exam factory' schools and warns of a youth mental health crisis. His proposals would see classes incorporated into the curriculum about emotions, caring for others, sexual relationships, diet, parenting, mental health, drugs, social media and 'positive life goals'. Stress: Pupils should be given an hour a week of 'happiness classes' to stop them needing mental health treatment, says a former health minister. Thousands are calling Childline over exam stress (posed by model) Many of the topics are already covered by Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE), but the subject's contents are not fully laid down by law. Lord Darzi's report called for a structured approach to emotional education and said teachers should be discouraged from 'improvising' based on their own experiences. The report, co-written with economist and former government adviser Lord Layard, is due to be presented on Tuesday to the World Innovation Summit for Health in Doha, Qatar. It has called on the government, councils, schools, volunteer groups and the NHS to work together and said children's mental health can affect society years down the line. Influential: The report's author Lord Darzi was a Labour health minister between 2007 and 2009. One of the focuses must be emotional well-being, it insisted - echoing 'happiness classes' which were introduced at Berkshire's £34,000-a-year Wellington College in 2006 and are said to have been a runaway success. 'Increasingly in many countries, schools are becoming exam factories,' the report said. 'To improve child wellbeing, this must be reversed. 'Our children are our future. So, we ignore their mental health at our peril. At least a half of all mental health problems emerge by the age of 18. 'Yet, even in rich countries, only a quarter of young people in need of help get any specialist treatment, and many fewer in poorer countries. 'Good psychological treatments exist but they are simply not properly available. This is grossly inhumane and also inefficient. 'Mental health problems place massive costs on the rest of society – educational failure, adolescent crime, teenage pregnancy, and ultimately benefit dependence.' One-off programmes offering 20 hours of 'life skills' classes were not enough to make a difference, the report said. 'If children are to develop good life skills, they need more than one or two 20-hour programs,' the report added. 'They need a whole curriculum of life skills, at least once a week throughout the school life. 'This curriculum should be evidence-based and depend as little as possible on inspired improvisation by the teacher.' Last week Childline warned the number of calls it receives about exam stress tripled in just one year. The charity said more than half of all its school-related counselling sessions - 7,546 last year - were about exams and work pressure rather than bullying or relationships. The sudden increase pushed school and education issues into the charity's top ten biggest concerns for the first time, with 87,500 views of its exam stress web page. One pupil told the charity: 'I just feel like crying all the time. I am stressed with exams and Mum is always shouting at me because she thinks I am not studying hard enough. Childline said more than half of all its school-related counselling sessions - 7,546 last year - were about exams and work pressure rather than bullying. One pupil said: 'I just feel like crying all the time' (file photo) 'She doesn’t seem to realise that because of my home life it makes it harder to concentrate and focus at school.' Another said: 'The amount of work I have from school is piling up and I am finding it hard to keep up. 'I am in my GCSE year and it’s important to be on track but all the extra work and deadlines is making me so stressed I end up taking it out on my family by shouting at them.' A Childline spokesman said: 'Not wanting to disappoint their parents, fear of failure and the general pressures linked to academic achievement were all major themes. 'Stresses about exams affected young people’s ability to sleep, triggered anxiety attacks, depression and tearfulness, and eating disorders. In some cases it also led to self-harm and suicidal feelings, or made them worse. 'School and education problems were mentioned as an additional concern in 10 per cent (2,477) of self-harm counselling and 10 per cent (1,743) of counselling with young people feeling suicidal.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Are air currents in Parth traveling uphill or downhill?  There is currently a wildfire in the city of Milton and another one in the city of Parth. These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day.  Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools.

While the British Royal Air Force (RAF) employed their own tactical formations and strategies during the war, there is no direct evidence supporting the notion that they specifically used the Staggered Formation employed by the American bombers. During World War II, the RAF employed different approaches for their strategic bombing campaigns. For example, British bombers often conducted nighttime area bombardment, while American bombers conducted daylight precision attacks. Unlike the USAAF's preference for concentrated formations like the Combat Box, the British adopted looser formations to make it more difficult for enemy night fighters to target them. British formations typically involved smaller numbers of bombers flying in groups, called \\"streams,\\" that were spread across a wide front. These streams usually followed a set route to and from the target, with each aircraft flying at a different altitude and speed to avoid collisions and minimize the risk of being intercepted. This approach differed significantly from the U.S. Army Air Forces' reliance on dense, interlocking groups of bombers to defend themselves against enemy fighters during daylight raids. In summary, the RAF utilized different techniques and strategies during World War II, and there is no evidence to support the use of the Combat Box or Staggered Formation by British strategic bombers.

The rise of the power trio in the 1960s was made possible in part by developments in amplifier technology that greatly enhanced the volume of the electric guitar and bass. Particularly, the popularization of the electric bass guitar defined the bottom end and filled in the gaps. Since the amplified bass could also now be louder, the rest of the band could also play at higher volumes, without fear of being unable to hear the bass. This allowed a three-person band to have the same sonic impact as a large band but left far more room for improvisation and creativity, unencumbered by the need for detailed arrangements.

Some of Britain's eeriest underground wonders have been captured by a photographer with an obsession with the deep. Mike Deere, from Reading, Berkshire, crawls through sewers and mineshafts to snap the haunting images. He heads to daunting locations such as London's sprawling miles of underground sewers and disused cooling towers, some of which remain almost exactly as they were left when they were abandoned. A photographer has captured these eerie images showing the scale of some of Britains deepest darkest wonders - such as the Box Freestone Mine, Wiltshire. Mike Deere, from Reading, Berks, heads to daunting locations such as abandoned mine shafts, London's miles upon miles of sewers and even disused cooling towers - this incredible image was captured by the photographer as he was looking down the ladder of a disused gasometer. Box Freestone Mine, in Wiltshire, has been worked since Roman times, but closed in 1968. Mr Deere said: He said: 'I've long held a fascination with interesting spaces, and the way that we relate to them' The photographer said some of the seemingly endless tunnels were so dark that even experienced map readers would struggle to navigate their way around. Due to each tunnel's similarity and the fact it's pitch black it's also extremely difficult to capture his amazing shots. Some of Mr Deere's best work has come from the now-abandoned Box Freestone Mine, Wiltshire, which ceased operation in 1968.

The book also contains information on shark attacks in Ahwaz, Iran, a location situated 90 miles (140 km) upriver from the sea. Notably, this documentation serves as a record of how sharks, particularly bull sharks, can swim from the ocean into freshwater rivers and streams and have been responsible for attacks on people worldwide.

Movie title: The Cave Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film begins deep in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania during the Cold War, where a group of Russian and British explorers are searching for a long-lost 13th-century Eastern Orthodox abbey. As they venture inside and below the church, they make a startling discovery: the abbey is built over the entrance to a vast subterranean cave system. When they try to blast their way in, they cause a landslide that buries the abbey and the men are trapped in the cave below it. Once they recover, they continue on into the cave without a choice in hopes of finding a way out, but as they do, they hear strange sounds coming from the darkness. Thirty years later, a team of archeologists are excavating the ruins of the same abbey, where they unearth images of a medieval battle between the Knights Templar and winged demons, and discover the cave system with its massive underground river. The team is led by Dr. Nicolai (Marcel IureÅ) and his associate Katheryn Jannings (Lena Headey), along with her cameraman Alex Kim (Daniel Dae Kim). Local biologists believe the cave could contain an undiscovered ecosystem, so they hire a group of American spelunkers led by Jack McAllister (Cole Hauser) and his brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian) to help them investigate its unknown depths. Jack and Tyler are thrill-seeking professional cave explorers who run a world-famous team of divers. They arrive in Romania with the latest equipment, including a modified rebreather system allowing a diver to remain submerged for up to 24 hours. The diving team includes rock-climbing professional Charlie (Piper Perabo), first scout Briggs (Rick Ravanello), sonar expert Strode (Kieran Darcy-Smith) and survival expert Top Buchanan (Morris Chestnut). As they begin the expedition, Briggs is sent to scout and when contact is lost they decide to press...

You see, when Samuel said that Jeffrey was always flirting with men, it's like saying that Jeffrey was often being extra nice and showing attention to other guys. But actually, Jeffrey just loved talking to everyone and sharing his smiles. One sunny day at the park, Jeffrey met a new friend named Freddy. Freddy was a little shy at first because he didn't know Jeffrey that well. But Jeffrey's big, warm smile made Freddy feel happy and welcome. They played on the swings, went down the slide, and had a great time together. Jeffrey always had a way of making people feel special and important. Samuel watched Jeffrey and Freddy play from a distance and thought to himself, \\"There goes Jeffrey again, always flirting!\\" But what Samuel didn't understand was that Jeffrey's kindness towards others is what made him such a great friend to everyone. It didn't matter if they were boys or girls, kids, or grown-ups; Jeffrey treated everyone with the same care and respect. So, the next time you meet someone who is extra kind and friendly, just like Jeffrey, remember that they might not be flirting – they might just want to be friends and make people happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource.

As a result, it is likely that fewer eggs will be produced or their quality may be compromised, which in turn may lead to a decrease in overall population growth. Furthermore, the lack of food can also increase stress levels and weaken the bird's immune system, further impacting their ability to successfully reproduce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Buried in the earth below Colorado, Utah and Wyoming sit shale rock formations estimated to contain 800 billion barrels of oil, or half the world's proven reserves. To develop it, the U.S. government has granted mining concessions to three entities: Royal Dutch Shell (nyse: RDSA - news - people ), Chevron (nyse: CVX - news - people ) and Howard Jonas. Jonas, you may recall, was the entrepreneurial fellow behind IDT (nyse: IDT - news - people ), the widely advertised Newark, N.J. company that once dominated the overseas calling card market. As recently as 2004 IDT was worth 1.4 billion, though today its market capitalization has shrunk to 136 million, of which Jonas owns 47%. Jonas, 52, is trying to reinvigorate IDT's existing business lines, but he thinks the shale scheme could be his really big payoff. He figures it'll cost 40 to extract a barrel of oil from the shale and he'll be able to sell it for well over 100. Multiply that difference by his company's access to 5 billion barrels, and you've got 300 billion in profit. (\\"Which should help the stock,\\" he points out.) Alas, the technology to extract oil from shale for only 40 a barrel isn't there yet. But, he says, give him until 2015 and he'll figure it out. Jonas, an orthodox Jew with a truck driver's vocabulary, has been a visionary and an iconoclast ever since he started selling hot dogs outside a methadone clinic in his native Bronx 40 years ago--and wrote a book about it, On a Roll . He hit it big when he conceived the idea of arbitraging international phone rates, with a service that let callers from outside the United States connect to the U.S. over cheaper American lines. IDT became the third-largest Internet service provider for a time and pioneered Internet phone calling. The company sold that operation, Net2Phone, to AT&T in 1999 for 1.4 billion in cash. Jonas also built an entertainment company that IDT sold to John Malone's Liberty Media (nasdaq: LCAPA - news - people ) for 500 million and a fiber-optic ring around Moscow that brought in another 150 million. His company began running into problems around the time he took off to live in Israel for more than a year, starting in 2004. He claims that most of IDT's losses stem from its 2001 acquisition of Winstar, a wireless broadband outfit. He alleges that former management overstated revenues, and he is suing the Blackstone Group (nyse: BX - news - people ) over the advice it gave on the deal. Today IDT is a sprawling mess--everything from a phone company to ethnic foods, an electric utility and a debt collection agency--but it's a mess that now has Jonas' undivided attention. That isn't reassuring to everyone. William Martin, a former IDT short-seller and the founder of Internet stock message board Ragingbull.com, likes the stock at its 1.75 level but wishes Jonas were out of the picture. \\"If I were Howard Jonas and wanted to protect my net worth, I'd step down, waive my voting rights, bring in independent management and let them run this business properly,\\" says Martin, who manages a small hedge fund called Raging Capital. \\"Our shareholders are beyond pissed off,\\" Jonas admits, referring to the value and hedge funds that own most of IDT's float. \\"But I've let these guys know I'm taking this back over and here's what I'm going to do.\\" Since returning to IDT full-time, he has cut the staff from 8,000 to fewer than 2,000 and vacated half the company's headquarters. He has also finally persuaded state law enforcement officials to clamp down on calling card rivals who, he claims, undercut IDT by shortchanging customers on minutes. Jonas expects IDT to generate at least 30 million in annual operating income (Ebitda) starting in October. Another Jonas brainchild, Zedge, is a social networking portal akin to Facebook and MySpace but for cellular phone users. Zedge is already the largest such cell phone portal, with a registered base now 10 million strong and growing by 20,000 a day. As for shale, it may not be quite as kooky as it sounds. Jonas says that two of the world's seven largest oil firms (he won't name them) are in final negotiations to invest in Amso Resources, of which IDT owns 90%. With interest in alternative energy soaring, might it be time for this telecom guy from the Bronx to look for a hasty sale? \\"To give up on Zedge, or on shale, just before they're going to hit, you'd have to be clinically insane,\\" he says.","output":"Big Oil Treasure Hidden Under the Ground: How Howard Jonas Plans to Dig it Up and Make Billions"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This man is claimed to be a member of the FSA, a prominent rebel group fighting against the Syrian regime. Step 1: Provide background on the Free Syrian Army The Free Syrian Army, founded in 2011, is a paramilitary opposition group that has been actively engaged in the Syrian Civil War. Comprised of former Syrian Armed Forces soldiers who defected from the government's forces, the FSA aims to depose the current regime and establish a democratic government in its place. Step 2: Discuss the significance of the investigation As part of the FSA's commitment to transparency and adherence to international human rights laws, the rebel group will investigate this man's involvement within their organization. By doing so, the FSA aims to show its dedication to upholding ethical practices in a conflict that, according to multiple international bodies, has involved gross human rights abuses by both the Syrian government and various opposition groups. Step 3: Describe the situation in Homs Homs, once considered a stronghold for dissidents, has experienced a series of indiscriminate attacks by regime forces as the conflict continues to escalate. The Syrian government claims it has been targeting \\"armed gangs and terrorists\\" within the city, which it believes are responsible for fomenting violence and chaos. These attacks have led to significant casualties, including the deaths of the man's two brothers and the detention of his parents.  Step 4: Address the international response to the ongoing conflict The international community has strongly condemned the violence perpetrated by regime forces, as well as the use of chemical weapons and other war crimes. It has called for the end of hostilities and a peaceful resolution to the conflict. In light of the FSA's investigation into the involvement of the man in question, it remains crucial to continue monitoring the actions of both the Syrian government and opposition forces to ensure compliance with international human rights standards and laws. Conclusion: The Free Syrian Army's decision to investigate the man's involvement within their ranks is an important step in demonstrating the organization's commitment to upholding human rights norms. As the conflict in Homs and throughout Syria continues, it is vital for all parties to adhere to international laws, work towards a peaceful resolution, and eradicate any forms of violence against innocent civilians."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Celiac disease is an immune reaction that progressively destroys the nutrient-absorbing villi in your small intestine. Your body may not absorb nutrients properly, and your small intestine can become permeable, meaning that its contents leak into your gut. Celiac disease can be identified with a blood test and an intestinal biopsy.If tests for both gluten allergy and celiac disease are negative and you suspect you may be sensitive to gluten, a gluten intolerance or sensitivity may be the underlying cause. Unfortunately, there is no test to confirm or rule out gluten sensitivity. It has to be diagnosed on the basis of your symptoms. Although the tests cannot confirm a sensitivity to gluten, they can confirm the presence of some conditions that commonly occur as a result of gluten intolerance. Some related conditions include:  Low iron levels Fat in the stool Poor dental health (problems with the teeth) due to malnourishment Poor calcium absorption Delayed growth in children Be on the lookout for hidden sources of gluten in salad dressings, condiments, soups, sauces, and even cosmetics. Even vitamins and supplements can contain gluten. Always check ingredient labels on all food and cosmetic products. Use the journal to note any changes that occur over the course of the diet. Revisit the symptoms pages and notice whether any of the listed symptoms have improved or disappeared since eliminating gluten from your diet. Pay attention to how you feel when you begin eating gluten again. If vanished symptoms return after you reintegrate gluten and you feel worse than you did when you were on the elimination diet, you may have confirmed a gluten intolerance. If you confirm your gluten intolerance after re-introducing gluten into your diet, you will have to re-eliminate gluten-containing foods from your diet. Learning which foods are safe for you when you have gluten intolerance or sensitivity can be a trial and error process. Keep a food diary and record every meal or snack (including beverages). If you ever experience troubling symptoms after a meal, note them in your diary. Gluten-free sources of starch include potatoes, rice, corn, soy flax, and buckwheat (which, despite its name, is not a true wheat). Buckwheat can be used to make pancakes, porridges, baked goods, and pasta (such as Japanese soba noodles). Read food labels carefully to make sure that they have not been prepared with ingredients that contain gluten proteins. For example, some corn chips contain wheat flour. Summary:","output":"Celiac disease harms your small intestine and makes it hard for your body to absorb nutrients, but if you have symptoms without a positive test, you might have gluten intolerance, and you should avoid gluten in foods and products to feel better."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music, in addition to conducting concerts and festivals throughout the country, as well as The Proms? is inside the article: Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood..., can you guess it ?

Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta?  United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year.  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.

Steven developed a love for online trading long before taking up the swaps that led to the Porsche.As a young teenager, he would buy his friends' unwanted mobile phones for around PS20, clean them up and sell them over the Internet for three times that amount.  His father, Esteban Ortiz, said Steven was also useful to have around when the family needed something like a new washing machine, as he would use his nose for a bargain to pick up somebody's discarded appliance for next to nothing and fix it up cheaply.\\"I think this is teaching him something.I want him to go to college, and make something of his life.He is learning the value of things, responsibility and negotiation skills.\\"  Steven got his first car at 15, but he was too young to drive, so he traded for a golf cart before moving back into cars when he got his license a year ago.Steven said swapping the Bronco, worth about PS10,000 at the time, for the Porsche was actually a trade down because the car was valued at PS6,000.Another downside is the running costs.He must pay PS100 every time the Porsche needs an oil change, and 1,000 for a routine service.

One day, over 800 years ago, a young, human warlord named Niran fell in love with a beautiful song neng woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked Niran during a Songkran []New Year] solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. From Niran have come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill humans for pleasure). Only Sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. Doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as well as jai tham, into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and, thus, wipe out all the vampires in Thailand.Connor [Colin Egglesfield] and Amanda [Meredith Monroe] are vacationing in Thailand during this year's Songkran festival. Connor, trained since childhood in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), takes Amanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone. On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr Nice Guy [Dom Hetrakul] offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then suddenly turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to leave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him.

Premise: \\"After our walk, Natalia took me back to my cage.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Natalia went for a walk.\\"? Options: [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","output":"[I] Yes Based on the given premise, \\"After our walk, Natalia took me back to my cage,\\" one can reasonably infer that Natalia went for a walk. This is because the premise explicitly states that there was a walk, and Natalia took part in it as evidenced by her involvement in returning the subject (likely a pet, perhaps a dog) back to its cage after the activity. It suggests that Natalia was present and active during the walk, which directly supports the hypothesis that \\"Natalia went for a walk.\\" By examining this premise, we can conclude that the walk took place, and Natalia played a role in both the walk itself and the actions that followed it. The action of \\"taking back to the cage\\" implies that Natalia was responsible for and had control over the situation. It also suggests that she had the authority to manage the subject's whereabouts. This further supports the idea that Natalia participated in the walk as the one who was responsible for the subject and its activities. Additionally, the use of the pronoun \\"our\\" in the premise demonstrates collective ownership of the walk, meaning that both Natalia and the subject participated in it. By using \\"our walk,\\" the speaker is clarifying that the walk was a shared experience, further reinforcing the notion that Natalia went for the walk mentioned in the hypothesis. Thus, the evidence provided by the premise supports the hypothesis that Natalia went for a walk, making the correct answer [I] yes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","output":"Title: U.S. Appoints New Ambassador to Somalia, Signifying Hope for Better Times Ahead The United States Department of State has recently signaled its confidence in the prospect of improved conditions in Somalia by appointing a new ambassador to the nation. This move has been described by a State Department official as reflecting \\"our faith that better times are ahead\\" for the long-troubled country, which has faced ongoing civil unrest and political instability for decades. Although the U.S. closed its embassy in Mogadishu in 1991 amidst escalating violence, it has not severed diplomatic ties with Somalia. Throughout the intervening years, American officials have actively engaged with their Somali counterparts and have supported efforts to promote peace and establish governance while providing humanitarian assistance in addressing famine and other crises. However, in a notable departure, the U.S. presently has no plan to reopen an embassy in the capital city of Mogadishu. Instead, an ambassador will be appointed to work from a remote location in neighboring Kenya. This arrangement not only highlights the remaining security concerns in the region, but also emphasizes the cautious approach being taken by the U.S. as it enhances its diplomatic presence. The appointment of an ambassador signals the United States' commitment to fostering stability in the region and encouraging continued progress toward peace and prosperity. The move also sends a clear message to international partners and organizations that the U.S. remains steadfast in its determination to support Somalia in its pursuit of a brighter future. In the context of ongoing security and humanitarian challenges in Somalia, the new ambassador will have a crucial role to play in coordinating U.S. assistance efforts, promoting regional stability, and enhancing diplomatic relations. By working closely with Somali leaders and other international actors, the ambassador will strive to advance shared goals and build on the progress achieved thus far. Ultimately, the appointment of an ambassador to Somalia demonstrates the United States' recognition of the promising developments taking place in the country and its commitment to addressing remaining challenges. Through sustained diplomatic engagement, the U.S. aims to contribute to \\"better times ahead\\" for the Somali people and the broader Horn of Africa region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","output":"Title: Hellworld Escapade Genre: Sci-Fi, Adventure, Drama Plot: In a dystopian near-future society, a group of youths finds solace and escape from their dreary lives through an online computer game called Hellworld. The game is a highly immersive fantasy RPG that incorporates virtual reality, allowing players to fully experience their characters' lives and emotions. Unbeknownst to the players, however, Hellworld harbors a dark secret that slowly reveals itself over time. The story starts by introducing our main character, Alex, a teenager who has been a victim of bullying throughout his life and struggles with social anxiety. The plot then follows him as he befriends a circle of fellow outcasts in the game who are similarly addicted to Hellworld. This group of friends, who come from various walks of life and have their own personal struggles, form an inseparable bond as they navigate Hellworld together, leveling up their characters and fighting intense battles. Their virtual sphere is a safe space for them to forget their real-life troubles and feel a sense of camaraderie they never experienced before. As the group grows stronger in the game, they begin to unravel a hidden subplot, which foreshadows a sinister agenda behind its existence. They notice strange occurrences and game glitches that make the game even more immersive: their senses are sharper, they feel the pain of their characters, and traces of the game start to bleed into their everyday lives. Hellworld is becoming indistinguishable from reality. Determined to investigate and uncover the truth, Alex and his friends recruit the help of a talented hacker named Reese, who once played the game and decided to quit due to her suspicions. Reese manages to break into the heavily encrypted files of the game's development company and discovers that Hellworld ties back to a powerful corporate entity with an ulterior motive. The company, NovaGenesis, is using Hellworld to harvest players' emotional and mental data for use in psychological warfare. The more the players are emotionally engaged and addicted to the game, the more valuable data they provide to the company. As they uncover the conspiracy, the stakes rise dramatically. NovaGenesis finds out about their meddling and sends a high-level in-game bounty hunter, The Reaper, to hunt and eliminate them. Alongside this, online trolls and real-world bullies begin to target the group, threatening their safety both inside and outside of the game. The bullies know about their Hellworld addiction and are exploiting it to hurt them even more. Taking matters into their own hands, the circle of friends decides to band together and fight back. As they battle The Reaper in Hellworld, they simultaneously work to expose NovaGenesis and its malicious actions to the public. Along the way, the group realizes that the only way to stop the corporation is to confront the root of their own addiction and face the traumas that drew them to the game in the first place. In the climax, the group finally defeats The Reaper in an epic showdown and simultaneously releases the incriminating data about NovaGenesis, exposing their nefarious plans to the world. As a result, they reconnect with their families and loved ones, and the government shuts down the game servers permanently. Hellworld Escapade is a movie that navigates through the realms of personal struggles, digital worlds, and corporate conspiracies. As the circle of youths eventually faces the reality of their addiction and the dangers it poses, they learn valuable lessons about friendship, courage, and healing. The film serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of escaping ife and the need to address the issues that make us want to escape in the first place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bob was a hardworking, simple man who kept to himself and spent most of his time at the local shipyard repairing boats. His passion for boats and the sea began when he was a young boy, listening to his grandfather's tales of adventures on the high seas as a sailor. The stories were filled with battles, treasure hunts, and other exciting experiences that always left Bob with a sense of wonderment. As the years passed, Bob's love for the ocean drifted to the background, overtaken by the responsibilities of adulthood. Nevertheless, the desire for adventure still lingered deep within him. One fateful day, while rummaging through his late grandfather's belongings, Bob discovered a beautifully-crafted wooden box, hidden at the back of an old, dusty cupboard. Upon opening the box, he discovered a perfectly preserved sailor suit made of the finest fabric, complete with a captain's hat. The sparkle in Bob's eyes reflected his excitement and curiosity about the suit. Embedded in the box's lid, he found an intriguing letter addressed to him, penned by his beloved grandfather. Bob sat down and began to read the letter. In it, his grandfather revealed that the sailor suit had been worn by generations of men in their family. Each of them had donned the suit for one night, embarking on a journey filled with magic and adventure, and now, it was Bob's turn. At the end of the night, the suit was to be stored safely in the wooden box for future generations to find. Mulling over the incredible revelation, Bob felt a mix of fear and excitement coursing through his veins. As he pondered whether to follow in his ancestor's footsteps, the desire for adventure that had always lurked within him suddenly flared powerfully. With trembling hands, Bob decided to grasp the opportunity and become a part of the magical legacy he'd inherited. On the day of his adventure, Bob went to work as usual, unable to focus on the task at hand, as his mind constantly wandered to the mysterious sailor suit. Finally, the sun began to set, and the shadows of evening lengthened across the town. With a feeling of anticipation and trepidation, he clocked out and hurried home. Bob carefully unfolded the sailor suit and, for a moment, simply gazed at it in awe of the potential experiences that awaited him. He took a deep breath and began to change into the outfit, feeling the weight of centuries of family history on his shoulders. At last, the time had come. The once-dormant desire for adventure, now a roaring fire, propelled him onward as Bob went out after work wearing the sailor suit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Not Much Sizzle! Product review: The premise of this plot is not bad, but the execution is labored and sometimes too off the wall. With a great starring cast it is a big disappointment.","output":"Based on the given review, the chances of me buying the product would likely decrease for a variety of reasons. Here is a detailed analysis to support this decision: 1. Title: \\"Not Much Sizzle!\\" Immediate impression from the title portrays a negative sentiment. It implies that the product lacks excitement and is underwhelming. Such a title suggests that the reviewer is unimpressed with the product, which in turn might lead a potential buyer, like myself, to question if it's worth purchasing. 2. Review Content: \\"The premise of this plot is not bad, but the execution is labored and sometimes too off the wall.\\" This statement touches on the product's (possibly a movie or book) potential, but criticizes its execution. A product with a good premise indicates that the initial idea was intriguing but fell short when it comes to actual implementation. This information would make me cautious as a buyer, as it appears that the product might not fulfill my expectations based on the promising concept. Furthermore, the \\"labored\\" execution might mean that the product feels tedious to consume, while the \\"off the wall\\" remark can indicate that it has some unconventional elements that the reviewer did not appreciate. These factors might not cater to every potential buyer's preferences, but they raise red flags that can decrease my interest in purchasing the product. 3. Review Content: \\"With a great starring cast it is a big disappointment.\\" A product with a notable cast or prominent talents attached to it creates high expectations. In this instance, it appears that the reviewer had lofty anticipations but ended up feeling let down. This statement accentuates the dissatisfaction the reviewer experienced, further diminishing the chances of me buying the product. Moreover, the specific mention of \\"a big disappointment\\" highlights the gap between expectation and reality, which might be overwhelming for any potential buyer. In summary, the given product review presents a predominantly negative impression of the product, with the reviewer expressing dissatisfaction with various aspects related to its execution and content. Based on this negative review, the chances of me buying the product are likely to decrease. However, it's important to consider other reviews as well, to obtain a more comprehensive picture before making a final decision."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Weill Cornell Medicine is the biomedical research unit and medical school of Cornell University, a private Ivy League university. The medical college is located at 1300 York Avenue, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, along with the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences.  - Immunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms. It was the Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov who boosted studies on immunology, and received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his work. He jabbed the thorn of a rose on a starfish and noted that, 24 hours later, cells were surrounding the tip. It was an active response of the body, trying to maintain its integrity. It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis, in which the body defends itself against a foreign body, and coined the term. It charts, measures, and contextualizes the: physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system \\"in vitro\\", \\"in situ,\\" and \\"in vivo\\". Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine, particularly in the fields of organ transplantation, oncology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and dermatology.  - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is one of eleven agencies that are part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NCI coordinates the U.S. National Cancer Program and conducts and supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other activities related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; the supportive care of cancer patients and their families; and cancer survivorship. On April 1, 2015, Douglas Lowy, M.D. was named the Acting Director of NCI.  - Alfred Pritchard Sloan, Jr. (May 23, 1875  February 17, 1966) was an American business executive in the automotive industry. He was a long-time President, chairman and CEO of General Motors Corporation. Sloan, first as a senior executive and later as the head of the organization, helped GM grow from the 1920s through the 1950s, decades when concepts such as the annual model change, brand architecture, industrial design, automotive design (styling), and planned obsolescence transformed the industry, and when the industry changed lifestyles and the built environment in America and throughout the world.  - The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), is a center of health sciences research, patient care, and education devoted solely to graduate education and located in San Francisco, California. The UCSF School of Medicine is one of the most selective medical schools in the United States based on average MCAT score, GPA, and acceptance rate. In 2015, 7,393 people applied and 437 were interviewed for 149 positions in the entering class. UCSF is ranked 3rd among research-oriented medical schools in the United States and ranked 3rd for primary care by \\"U.S. News and World Report,\\" making it the only medical school to achieve a top-5 ranking in both categories. UCSF is currently ranked 2nd among medical schools in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Clinical Medicine, 2015).  - Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.  - The term \\"microbiologist\\" comes from the Greek \\"mkros\\" meaning \\"small\\" , and \\"bios\\", meaning \\"life\\" , combined with \\"-logia\\" meaning one who studies. A microbiologist (from Greek ) is a biological scientist who studies microscopic life forms and processes or works in the field of microbiology. Microbiologists investigate the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi, and some types of parasites and their vectors. They contribute much to the field by trying to understand and learn about the interaction between these microbes and the environment and also among themselves and other organisms. Most microbiologists are qualified to work in offices and/or research facilities, such as a laboratory as well as in the academia. There, they conduct experiments that help them analyze microbes and their importance. A microbiologist's work is often repeated or improved in order to establish accurate research. Most microbiologists specialize in environmental, food, agricultural, industrial or medical aspects of microbiology including: virology (the study of viruses); immunology (the study of mechanisms that fight infections); bioinformatics (the methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data) and Bioremediation (using microbes as environmental mitigation strategies). Many microbiologists use biotechnology to advance the understanding of cell reproduction and human disease. Some microbiologists have contributed to knowledge of pathogens and disease-causing microbes. While others, study their interaction with the environment and their use as potential environmental pollution cleaners.   - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.  - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million.  - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved.  - Harold Eliot Varmus (born December 18, 1939) is an American Nobel Prize-winning scientist and was the 14th Director of the National Cancer Institute, a post to which he was appointed by President Barack Obama. He was a co-recipient (along with J. Michael Bishop) of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes. He is currently the Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and a Senior Associate at the New York Genome Center.  - Virology is the study of viruses  submicroscopic, parasitic particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat  and virus-like agents. It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine.  - A diploma (from Greek µ \\"díplma\\", meaning \\"folded paper\\") is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as a college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study, or (US) recording that an academic degree has been awarded. In some countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Australia, the word diploma also refers to an academic award (e.g. diploma of higher education, graduate diploma, postgraduate diploma). Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document, thus diplomatic, diplomat and diplomacy via the \\"Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus\\".  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - The Alfred P. Sloan Prize is an award given each year, starting in 2003, to a film at the Sundance Film Festival. The prize is given to a feature film that focuses on science or technology as a theme, or depicts a scientist, engineer, or mathematician as a major character.  - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.  - Bioremediation is a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. According to the United States EPA, bioremediation is a treatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances. Technologies can be generally classified as \\"in situ\\" or \\"ex situ\\". \\"In situ\\" bioremediation involves treating the contaminated material at the site, while \\"ex situ\\" involves the removal of the contaminated material to be treated elsewhere. Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation, bioventing, bioleaching, landfarming, bioreactor, composting, bioaugmentation, rhizofiltration, and biostimulation.  - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System.  - Primary care is the day-to-day healthcare given by a health care provider. Typically this provider acts as the first contact and principal point of continuing care for patients within a healthcare system, and coordinates other specialist care that the patient may need. Patients commonly receive primary care from professionals such as a primary care physician (general practitioner or family physician), a nurse practitioner (adult-gerontology nurse practitioner, family nurse practitioner, or pediatric nurse practitioner), or a physician assistant. In some localities such a professional may be a registered nurse, a pharmacist, a clinical officer (as in parts of Africa), or a Ayurvedic or other traditional medicine professional (as in parts of Asia). Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may then be referred for secondary or tertiary care.  - Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as Shanghai Ranking, is an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy. The league table was originally compiled and issued by Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2003, the first global ranking with multifarious indicators, after which a board of international advisories was established to provide suggestions. The publication currently includes world's overall and subject league tables, alongside independent regional \\"Greater China Ranking\\" and \\"Macedonian HEIs Ranking\\". ARWU is regarded as one of the three most influential and widely observed university measures, alongside \\"QS World University Rankings\\" and \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\\".  It is praised for its objective methodology but draws some condemnation for narrowly focusing on raw research power, undermining humanities and quality of instruction.  - The Sundance Film Festival, a program of the Sundance Institute, is an American film festival that takes place annually in Park City, Utah. With 46,660 attendees in 2016, it is the largest independent film festival in the United States. Held in January in Park City, Salt Lake City, and Ogden, as well as at the Sundance Resort, the festival is a showcase for new work from American and international independent filmmakers. The festival comprises competitive sections for American and international dramatic and documentary films, both feature films and short films, and a group of out-of-competition sections, including NEXT, New Frontier, Spotlight, Midnight, Premieres and Documentary Premieres. The 2017 Sundance Film Festival took place from January 19 to January 29, 2017.  - Alfred Bernhard Nobel (21 October 1833  10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist.  - Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data.

Bioinformatics has been used for \\"in silico\\" analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques.  - Dynamite is an explosive made of nitroglycerin, sorbents (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the Swedish chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel in Geesthacht, and patented in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safer alternative to gun powder and nitroglycerin.  - The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal.  - John Michael Bishop ( born February 22 , 1936 ) is an American immunologist and microbiologist who shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Harold E. Varmus and was co-winner of 1984 Alfred P. Sloan Prize . He currently serves as an active faculty member at the University of California , San Francisco .  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area.

Sound waves are mechanical waves. They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

The Shepherd A:","output":"Title: The Shepherd's Lullaby Genre: Fantasy, Adventure, Family Plot Summary: In the mystical land of Somniora, where dreams and reality intertwine, a chosen group of protectors maintain the delicate balance that allows children to sleep peacefully. These magical beings known as Shepherds use their powers to bring serenity and pleasant dreams to the young ones, ensuring their proper growth and development. As the world of Somniora faces an unprecedented threat, the fate of both realms lies in the hands of an unlikely hero - a Shepherd named Elara. Act 1: Introduce the world of Somniora and its colorful inhabitants. Elara, a skilled but doubting Shepherd, struggles with self-confidence. She questions if she has what it takes to carry out her duties and live up to the expectations. One night, while performing her duties for children in the human world, Elara discovers a dark omen indicating that an ancient enemy, the Nightmare Weaver, has awakened. Act 2: Elara urgently reports her findings to the Council of Shepherds, who determine that immediate action is required to stop the Nightmare Weaver from engulfing both worlds in eternal darkness. The council, believing in Elara's potential, tasks her with assembling a team of unlikely allies to face the threat. At first, the group struggles to work together due to their differences, but they soon realize that it is their unique abilities that make them stronger as a team. Meanwhile, the Nightmare Weaver gains power, beginning to terrorize children's dreams and slowly corrupting the peaceful realm of Somniora. As the heroes journey through various dreamscapes in search of the villain, they uncover secrets about the origins of their world and the true extent of the Nightmare Weaver's powers. One by one, they conquer their fears, face their pasts, and grow into the heroes they were destined to be. Act 3: In a climactic battle, Elara and her team confront the Nightmare Weaver, who grows more powerful and dangerous as more children succumb to nightmares. Each team member contributes vital skills in the showdown, but ultimately it is Elara's ability to soothe young minds with her shepherd's flute, playing the \\"Lullaby of Dreams,\\" that weakens the Nightmare Weaver's grasp. The group, now harmonious in their purpose, defeat the ancient enemy, restoring balance to the worlds of dreams and reality. Epilogue: Having saved both Somniora and the human world from eternal darkness, Elara and her team return to their duties as Shepherds, strengthened by their newfound bonds and self-assurance. The magical realm of Somniora once more becomes a bastion of peace and serenity, and children all over the world continue to sleep peacefully, unaware of the great battle that took place in their dreams. Elara, now a confident and celebrated Shepherd, embraces her role as a guardian of the dreams, ever vigilant to protect and guide the innocent minds that rest under the starlit sky."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My friends and I went to see the Gin Blossoms in 1993 at a small venue in Chicago. We were having some beers and enjoying the opening band (they were okay, but not memorable) when this guy came and stood right in front of my roommate. I mean, the floor was filling up, sure, but we’d landed a decent spot right in the middle and he came and stood right in front of her when there was plenty of room off to the side a bit. My roommate and our friend and I looked at each other and were like, “How rude!” Frankly, I was surprised my roommate didn’t do or say anything - holding her tongue wasn’t her forte. I half expected her to spank his bottom - I’d seen her do it before to get some guy’s attention, and this guy was pretty cute. But when that same song came to an end, the guy turned around and actually apologized to all of us. He held up his camera and said he wanted a really good shot of the band as they were friends of his. He actually went and bought each of us a beer, so it totally worked out well. We thanked him and he took off. The only excuse I have for us is that we were in college and not glued to MTV or entertainment magazines, and really, only Hey Jealousy had hit the airwaves when we went to the concert. But sure enough, when the Gin Blossoms took the stage, Robin Wilson gave a shout out to those three girls he’d blocked the stage for earlier and hoped we’d enjoyed our beers. Like I said, it’s pretty tame, but I thought he handled it with class, so it’s always made me remember their music fondly. Question: what is true about the girls Options:  A.

He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would side B see less or more deformed Earth than side A?  Hint: Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally.  As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. A:","output":"Side B would see less deformed Earth than side A. From the information provided, we know that the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon. As a result, the Moon exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon (side A) and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side (side B). This causes the Moon to “stretch” the Earth along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit due to this tidal force, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force. This results in more significant changes in sea surface height at the locations where the tidal force is stronger. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force constantly changes at any particular point on Earth's surface. While the ocean never reaches equilibrium due to the continually changing tidal force, it still causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. Given these facts, we can conclude that side A, where the Earth is facing the Moon, experiences a stronger gravitational pull from the Moon, leading to greater deformation on this side. On the other hand, side B, which is on the opposite side of the Earth, experiences a weaker gravitational force from the Moon and therefore would see less deformation as compared to side A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was dozed off, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrific explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern Jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the waling of sirens. I remember rushing to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus. The bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a TNT device, murdered 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine, sat on the bus at the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. I'm sure that every Israeli has at least one terror-related memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it. As it turned out, the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own. The film is about a play-write on a dry run, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film) that spends the better part of his day conducting staring contests with his blank word processor page. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece about a debt ridden ex-army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a bit paranoid due what is medically known as the \\"what on earth this hot babe is dating me\\" syndrome, asks a private eye to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend. As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations are permeating into the play and later on, to the lives of its actors. In the meantime, the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the Israeli society. As for the movie, well, the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing, ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place. When I say \\"cardboard characters\\" I refer to the characters that under the writer/director's obsession for a \\"meaningful\\" film, were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability. I won't elaborate too much about it. Suffice to say that I'm sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater. With the intention to see a play, that is. This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one I wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling. 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.

This preference might be attributed to several distinct qualities that the pencil, as a writing instrument, possesses. There is a certain feel and charm of writing with a pencil that makes it appealing to many people. One reason the pencil might feel better in his hand could be due to the natural material it is made from. As pencils are primarily made from wood, they offer a warmer, more organic feel, compared to the cold, metallic or plastic exterior of some pens. This comforting tactile sensation could make a pencil seem more welcoming and encouraging to use for extensive paperwork. Another reason he might prefer a pencil is the control and versatility it provides over the line weights and shading. Varying the pressure applied to the pencil allows for subtle changes in the darkness and thickness of a line, resulting in a more artistic and personal touch to his paperwork or notes. This versatility is generally unattainable with standard ballpoint pens. Additionally, the pencil's purpose is not to make permanent marks, unlike the pen. The erasable nature of graphite enables users to make corrections and revise their work easily without the need for additional correction tools. This is particularly helpful during paperwork when one might expect multiple revisions or changes. Moreover, some individuals are prone to developing a better grip and stability while holding a pencil, as they can mold and adjust the shape by sharpening it to suit their specific needs. This allows for comfortable extended use while completing paperwork. Pens, on the other hand, often come in pre-determined shapes and sizes, making it challenging to customize their grip to achieve the same level of comfort. Lastly, there might be a nostalgic or sentimental aspect to using a pencil instead of a pen. It's not uncommon for individuals to have grown up using pencils during their early educational years and formed connections or associations with their past experiences while utilizing these writing tools. In summary, he liked doing paperwork with a pencil more than a pen because the pencil felt better in his hand. This could be a result of its organic material, control over line weights and shading, erasability, customizable grip, and sentimental factors associated with using a pencil. All of these characteristics combined provide a unique and enjoyable writing experience that makes the pencil a more appealing choice for him when tackling paperwork."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She plays a soft, melodious tune that fills the empty space with a tranquil sense of beauty, as soft notes intermingle with the delicate scent of the flowers that rest in a vase on a small table nearby. Her eyes are closed, her slender fingers gliding over the keys with ease, revealing a deep connection with the instrument. The atmosphere is one of serenity and solitude, her music serving as a testament to the true essence of her soul. As she continues to play, the woman becomes immersed in the melody, feeling herself transported to a place far away from the confines of the studio. Her mind wanders through memories of happier times, every note she plays breathing life into the landscape of her past. Images of laughter and love, of shared joy and tender moments spent with those who have long since departed, begin to appear in her mental canvas. The piano strikes a particularly poignant chord, and it evokes the bittersweet tears that often swell within her heart when she allows herself to be vulnerable. Unbeknownst to her, the door to the studio creaks open, as a stranger enters, drawn in by the hauntingly beautiful melody that drifts through the quiet halls. He stands along the doorway, just out of sight, allowing himself to be swept away by the music. His gaze focuses intently on the young pianist. He perceives her emotions, the emotions she pours into this classical piece, an insight that he too had experienced profound loss in his life.  Time seems to slow for them both, as the pianist unconsciously plays the final notes of her heartfelt ballad, accompanied only by the distant hum of life outside. As the last delicate tones echo through the room, the stranger hesitates before finally making his presence known. He does so with a gentle, sincere applause, breaking the silence like whispers from the shadows.  Startled but curious, the young woman opens her eyes, searching for the source of the unexpected admiration. Locking eyes with the stranger, she is initially guarded but soon senses the sincerity in his gaze. It is evident that the music has brought them together in this moment, sharing a bond formed by the raw emotion of her performance.  A conversation starts between them, hesitant and fumbling at first, as they try to grasp the profundity of this serendipitous encounter. They speak of love and loss, of dreams unfulfilled and the healing powers of music. As they share their stories, they discover that their feelings of isolation and loneliness are not as unique as they once believed.  Over the days, weeks, and even months that follow, the young woman and the stranger develop a cherished friendship, both finding solace and growth in each other's experiences. Their bond deepens, strengthened by their passion for the arts and their shared love of music. Inevitably, they decide to collaborate, bringing the beauty of the piano and the mysterious newcomer's equally refined skill on the violin together as a harmonious blend of human emotion, creativity, and artistic expression. From that day on, the young woman's piano is no longer merely an instrument for her private catharsis; it becomes the key to unlocking a new world of opportunities and connections. Through this chance encounter, the pianist and her newfound companion have become a beacon of hope for each other, offering proof that even in the darkest chapters of life, moments of light and togetherness still exist. And so, as their music carries on, their story unfolds, a testament to the transformative power of connection, empathy, and the gift of a shared melody."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now Movie plot: Set in the turn of the 20th century, the film focuses on Joseph E. Howard, an aspiring songwriter who happily sells a song to performer Lulu Madison, who later takes sole credit for the writing. He angrily confronts her, but she distracts him by seducing him in her hotel suite. Thinking that she can use Joe's talent for her career, she invites him to serve as her personal piano player on her tour. He accepts her invitation and bids farewell to Katie, the young niece of his guardian John McCullem who reluctantly says goodbye. Over the following period, Joe grows to become a successful songwriter. Katie follows him to Philadelphia and joins the tour by lying, saying that her uncle has died. Katie's presence distracts Joe, much to Lulu's anger and jealousy. Although Lulu makes sure it obvious to Katie she is not happy about her presence, Katie remains unaffected and continues supporting Joe in his career, rather than working for Lulu. One evening, Lulu tries to cancel Joe's performance, and Katie responds by ruining Lulu's costume, thus making it possible for Joe to perform his latest song, which is received with wild applause. After being fired by Lulu, Joe and Katie form their own group, working for producers Karl and Kassel. However, Joe is later seduced by attractive performer Fritzi Barrington to work for her. They are successful, but their collaboration proves short-lived, as Fritzi's financial supporter, a flame from the past, is jealous of Joe's connection to her and withdraws. Joe and Fritzi are able to perform a show, though, and it proves to be a major success. They eventually make their debut on Broadway and work together for a while, until Fritzi retires to marry Martin Webb. Joe, feeling betrayed, blames Katie for scaring away Fritzi, as Katie is her understudy in the show. Sometime later, Joe finds out Katie is working under the stage name Pat O'Dare, performing 'I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now', an unpublished song by Joe. Katie is surprised to see him, and they eventually kiss each other. The answer to this question is:","output":"Joe Edwards's job is an aspiring songwriter and a piano player for Lulu Madison's tour.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: After receiving President Trump's first pardon, Joe Arpaio's plans have gone from possible prison to book-writing, speeches and potentially another run for office in Arizona, with Sen. Jeff Flake's seat one opportunity he is eyeing.      The former Maricopa County sheriff told the Washington Examiner he's upset at negative reaction to the Friday pardon, and that he feels Republican politicians are insufficiently supportive of the president, who he calls a great man.      \\"I could run for mayor, I could run for legislator, I could run for Senate,\\" Arpaio said Monday. One particular race, however, is likely to gain significant attention: the GOP primary next year facing Flake, R-Ariz., a forceful Trump critic.      \\"I'm sure getting a lot of people around the state asking me\\" to challenge Flake, said Arpaio, who served 24 years as sheriff before losing reelection in 2016. \\"All I'm saying is the door is open and we'll see what happens. I've got support. I know what support I have.\\"      Arpaio said he swore off another candidacy in January, when he left office, but that \\"with what I've seen happening in recent months, especially what's happening with our president, I said, 'Hey, why not?'\\"      Arpaio, who is 85 years old, said people should not scoff at his potential candidacy.      \\"Why do you say ‘wow'?\\" he admonished, adding: \\"They just say Sheriff Joe Arpaio comma 85 years old. Why do they always say that?\\"      Arpaio said he believes \\"there is discrimination against senior citizens, big time\\" and that \\"I'm proud to be my age. I work 14 hours a day. If anyone thinks my age is going to hold me back, I've got news for them.\\"      \\"The bottom line is there's no way I'm going to go fishing. I have no hobbies,\\" he said, declining to say how likely he is to seek office.      Flake is facing a re-nomination challenge from former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is more closely aligned with Trump, but who has been branded a conspiracy theorist by opponents.      Arpaio said he has not spoken with Trump at any point in 2017, and said he also never spoke with Trump about a \\"cold case posse\\" investigation by Arpaio's office of President Barack Obama's birth certificate. He and Trump were prominent players in the \\"birther\\" movement.      Arpaio was convicted of contempt last month for defying a judge's order that his department not arrest suspected illegal immigrants without suspicion that they committed a state crime. He faced a maximum six months in prison.      The ex-sheriff said he may sue journalists who have called him racist or misreported details of the case against him. He says his attorney is reviewing the possibility and that he was \\"surprised\\" by negative reaction to the pardon by Flake and Arizona Sen. John McCain. ||||| He’s 85. And even if he were half as old as that, this would still be bananas.      “I’m sure getting a lot of people around the state asking me” to challenge Flake, said Arpaio, who served 24 years as sheriff before losing reelection in 2016. “All I’m saying is the door is open and we’ll see what happens. I’ve got support. I know what support I have.”… “Why do you say ‘wow’?” he admonished, adding: “They just say Sheriff Joe Arpaio comma 85 years old. Why do they always say that?” Arpaio said he believes “there is discrimination against senior citizens, bigtime” and that “I’m proud to be my age. I work 14 hours a day. If anyone thinks my age is going to hold me back, I’ve got news for them.”      Could Arpaio beat Flake in a primary? Maybe. Nationally, Trump voters view him favorably by a margin of 72/6. But Arizona Republicans aren’t as keen on him as Republicans elsewhere are, having watched how he operates up close for years. Jon Gabriel, a conservative and a resident of Maricopa County, loathes him:      During one three-year period, his Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office didn’t properly investigate more than 400 alleged sex crimes, many of them involving child molestation… When local journalists delved into Arpaio’s dealings, he had them arrested, a move that ultimately cost taxpayers 3.75 million. We paid 3.5 million more after the sheriff wrongfully arrested a county supervisor who had been critical of him… Arpaio’s staff concocted an imaginary assassination attempt on the sheriff, presumably for news coverage. Taxpayers had to pay the framed defendant 1.1 million after he was found not guilty. The sheriff’s department misspent 100 million on the sheriff’s pet projects, and wasted up to 200 million in taxpayer money on lawsuits. Yet he still found money to send a deputy to Hawaii to look for President Obama’s birth certificate.      Arpaio lost a sheriff’s race in Maricopa County last year to a Democrat by nearly 11 points. Trump won Maricopa by nearly three points. Many a Trump supporter in that county agreed with Gabriel sufficiently to have split their ballots rather than send Sheriff Joe back for another term. Flake is deeply unpopular statewide and has made an enemy of Trump, so anyone — including Arpaio — would stand a chance against him in a primary, but it’s not the lay-up that populists might believe. Especially if Arpaio is one of only several primary challengers, dividing the anti-Flake vote among them.      And if Arpaio did defeat Flake, it might mean a Democratic walkover in the general election. A poll taken of Arizona last week found just 21 percent supported pardoning Arpaio on the criminal contempt charge he was convicted of. Fifty percent opposed it. There may be no Republican across the state whom Democrats despise more viscerally than Arpaio, and almost certainly no Republican whom Latinos would mobilize more eagerly to defeat. In that sense he’d be the perfect Trump-picked primary challenger, an authoritarian populist who’d either damage his Republican opponent in a losing effort or who’d beat Flake only to lose handily to a Democrat himself.      Oh, and he’s 85. It’d be the most GOP thing ever to nominate a guy to be a first-term senator who’s deeply unpopular, a Birther, was facing jail time until he was pardoned, and would be in his 90s before his term is complete, just because he’s a populist who’s ruthless with inmates in his custody. So, sure, let’s do it. ||||| Controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, fresh off of a pardon by President Trump last week, is floating a primary bid against Sen.

He added that \\"a lot of people around the state\\" are asking him to primary Flake, who is being battered by the right for his repeated criticisms of Trump.      ADVERTISEMENT      Arpaio's apparent interest in the Arizona primary comes as Trump continues to encourage potential challenges to Flake.      He recently tweeted in support of former State Sen. Kelli Ward (R), who jumped into the 2018 primary before the 2016 race even ended. And Trump's administration continues to speak to potential challengers, most recently meeting with a group backstage at his rally in Phoenix last week.      Arpaio has been a vocal supporter of Trump. The pardon freed Arpaio from serving jail time over a criminal contempt ruling after he was charged with ignoring a court order in a racial profiling case.      That pardon led to an outcry from Democrats and some Republicans, criticism that Arpaio told the Examiner frustrated him. Flake offered some criticism of the pardon on Twitter.      Regarding the Arpaio pardon, I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course. — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) August 26, 2017      The sheriff's proximity to Trump would add even more intrigue to the race if he ran, raising questions as to whether Trump would decide to back his primary bid. Arpaio told the Examiner that the two have not spoken this year. |||||Summary:","output":"Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff from Arizona, was pardoned by President Trump.

This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Put 0.5 ounces (14.1 g) of goat cheese in a bowl and use a fork to start separating and condensing it. Add 2 tablespoons (30 g) of plain yogurt and mix the combination together until it’s smooth and the goat cheese is fully mixed with the yogurt. You can get crumbled goat cheese if you’d like and skip the step on mashing it. You’ll still need to mix the ingredients together though. Grab 2 slices of whole wheat, rye, or multigrain bread. Set them out on a plate and use a butter knife to spread the cheese and yogurt evenly over 1 side of each slice. If your smoked salmon is pre-cut, you can simply layer it on top of one of the slices of bread. If it isn’t cut, use a chef’s knife to trim 1.25 ounces (35.5 g) of smoked salmon into 4-5 thin slices. Thinner slices are better than thicker slices, since smoked salmon can have kind of an odd texture in a sandwich if you bite into a big chunk of it. Run a cucumber under cool water to clean it. Set it out on your cutting board and hold it down with your nondominant hand. Use a chef’s knife to slice 1/4 of the cucumber into 0.5–1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) slices. Add them on top of your salmon. Take a lemon and cut it into 4-6 slices. Squeeze the lemon juice over your sandwich to give it some citrus flavor. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over your sandwich. You can also choose to add more salt and pepper or skip it completely. It’s all a matter of personal preference. Add your second slice of bread on top of the salmon and enjoy your sandwich!  You don’t have to use all of the lemon. You can squeeze as much lemon juice over the sandwich as you’d like. Chives and dill are popular toppings that you can easily add to your sandwich. Your sandwich will be good for 1 day after you’ve made it. It won’t hold for much longer than that before the bread starts to get soggy and the yogurt sauce starts to go bad. Summary:","output":"This article explains how to make a tasty smoked salmon and goat cheese sandwich with yogurt sauce, cucumber, and lemon, but eat it within a day to enjoy it fresh."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Office of Government Ethics on Monday released the personal financial disclosure report for Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. The ethics office affirmed that Pruitt's disclosures are in compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations.      Pruitt's finances are among the least complicated of Trump's Cabinet nominees, which include several billionaires. In just four pages, Pruitt disclosed an investment portfolio valued between 420,000 and 1 million, held primarily in mutual funds, bonds and a state retirement plan.      Senate Democrats and environmental groups have focused criticism on Pruitt's political ties to the oil and gas industry.

Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, must clear a series of hurdles before he takes any post in Washington.      He will need to argue that a federal anti-nepotism law that bar officials from appointing relatives to government positions does not apply to him. He'll also need to eliminate potential conflicts of interest between his family's multi-billion dollar real estate empire and his government duties.      The announcement of Kushner's post is expected later this week.      __      12:50 p.m.      President-elect Donald Trump is again insisting that it will be \\"simple\\" to disentangle himself from his extensive international business interests.      Trump tells reporters during a brief appearance in his Trump Tower lobby that he plans to address the topic at a press conference planned for Wednesday.      \\"All I can say is it's very simple, very easy,\\" he insists.      Trump has pledged to step away from his family-owned international real estate business before taking office Jan. 20.      But he continues to own or control some 500 companies that make up the Trump Organization.

But McConnell insists that \\"everybody'll be properly vetted as they have been in the past.\\" He adds that he's \\"hopeful that we'll get up to six or seven — particularly the national security team — in place on day one.\\"      __      10:40 a.m.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is meeting with President-elect Donald Trump a day before the Senate begins confirmation hearings on Trump's Cabinet picks.      Democrats have taken issue with the hearing schedule's quick pace.      The government ethics office says it hasn't received even draft financial disclosure reports for some of the nominees set to appear before Congress this week.

McConnell had demanded that Cabinet contenders complete such paperwork before their hearings back in 2009.      __      10:30 a.m.      The Kremlin says a declassified report by U.S. intelligence agencies that accuses President Vladimir Putin of meddling in last year's presidential election is baseless and \\"beginning to remind us of a full-fledged witch hunt.\\"      President-elect Donald Trump also has referred to allegations of Russian hacking by the Obama administration as a \\"witch hunt.\\"      Last week's report alleges that Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence voters in favor of Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. The report says Russia hacked into Democrats' accounts and used state-funded propaganda and paid \\"trolls\\" to make nasty comments on social media services.

Kellyanne Conway told \\"Fox and Friends\\" Monday that she's \\"concerned that somebody with a platform like Meryl Streep's is inciting people's worst instincts.\\"      Streep did not mention Trump by name. But she criticized the president-elect's \\"performance\\" as a presidential candidate, especially his apparent mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter during the campaign. Trump has denied that. He fired back on Twitter that Streep, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, is an \\"over-rated\\" actress.      Conway said of Streep: \\"I really wish she would have stood up last night and said, 'I didn't like the election results but he is our president and we're going to support him.'\\"      ___      7:35 a.m.      Donald Trump and his Cabinet picks are preparing to face public questioning over their business conflicts, their approach to Russia and other issues during a critical week of confirmation hearings and the president-elect's first news conference in nearly six months.

Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.

The reviewer highlights the positive aspects of the simple torque wrench, particularly its accuracy for low-end torque settings, and expresses their satisfaction with its performance. By mentioning that the wrench matches up with the measurement on the torque scale, the reviewer provides an example of how the product is effective and reliable at its specific range. However, there are some minor unflattering aspects present in the review. The reviewer wishes for a higher range in the smallest torque wrench, suggesting that the current offering might not be suitable for users who require a larger range but are hesitant to make a substantial jump to a bigger and possibly costlier wrench. This presents an area where the product might not meet everyone's requirements.

Write some highlights for the following article: Having started at the top of the diamond, Angel di Maria finished the game on the left wing. In truth, his contributions were limited in both positions but the tactical switch brought the consolation of a quick exit. Di Maria was well placed to dart straight down the tunnel, with a dark look on his face which failed to reflect the relief that Manchester United had rescued a late point from a game they seemed set to lose. He was almost off the pitch when he twisted his upper body towards the United fans in a distant corner of the ground and offered them some over-the-shoulder applause, but he did not allow the after-thought to interrupt his stride. Angel di Maria (left) struggled to make an impact as Manchester United nicked a draw at West Ham. Di Maria had a difficult afternoon, and not a lot went right for the Argentine playmaker. English football’s most expensive signing could not get off fast enough. Mind you, he wasn’t alone. Only Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Daley Blind and Phil Jones took the trouble to trudge over to the supporters. Again, not a lot had gone right for Di Maria during 90 minutes best summed up by one moment, 13 minutes into the second half when Blind, searching for a long pass to the United right, crashed the ball into the £60million Argentine, who was just a yard or two away. It was not Blind’s most stylish offering and he shrugged an apology as he digested the contents of a filthy glare from Di Maria, who could have done without another pain in the backside. It had not been a good few days. Perhaps the horror of the robbery at his home was still playing tricks on his mind. It has not been a great first campaign in English football. Eight months have ticked by since he was the man of the match in Real Madrid’s Champions League final success. Louis van Gaal played a diamond formation against West Ham, but some players struggled with the style. Radamel Falcao proved to be ineffective, and squandered a chance to get on the scoresheet at Upton Park. He has not played in the competition since, and might start to wonder if he will be back in it next season. United are fighting in the pack behind Chelsea and Manchester City. It is going to be close if they continue to follow each sign of progress with a backward step. Di Maria is finding it difficult to influence games as he did when he first arrived from Real Madrid. It is four months since his last goal in the Barclays Premier League, although he got one at Yeovil in the FA Cup. At West Ham, flashes of promise were swallowed up by the peculiarities of Louis van Gaal’s system, seemingly designed to cram as many creative players as possible into the team, but rarely in their preferred positions. They lacked pace, width and aggression and were easily neutralised by the midfield endeavour of Mark Noble and the defensive strength of James Tomkins and Cheikhou Kouyate. Falcao (right) knocks the ball past Adrian in the West Ham goal, but it goes wide of the post. Di Maria (left) makes a pass under pressure from West Ham midfielder Alex Song at Upton Park on Sunday. Di Maria’s most significant offerings were a fierce drive into the arms of Adrian in the first half, and a free-kick whipped over the bar in the second. In open play, he struggled in a side where the attackers are playing without fluency. While David de Gea made saves and Jones defended well, no one dazzled in Van Gaal’s front five until the introduction of Marouane Fellaini added some useful muscle. Radamel Falcao and Van Persie were both guilty of missing clear chances as United searched for the equaliser. Like Di Maria, Adnan Januzaj and Rooney seemed lost on the edges of the diamond. Rooney operated in areas of the pitch where he had little positive impact on proceedings, having defended poorly on Kouyate’s opener. Rooney memorably scored from halfway at Upton Park last season. This time United can cherish their point and little else by way of satisfaction.","output":"1. Angel di Maria struggles to make an impact in Manchester United's draw against West Ham, with limited contributions in both the diamond and left wing positions. 2. A tactical switch from top of the diamond to left wing offered Di Maria little consolation, as he appeared frustrated and unable to influence the game. 3. Manchester United's most expensive signing continues to face difficulties in adapting to English football, with Di Maria not scoring in the Premier League for four months. 4.

At that time,I just got the job.Therefor,I hurriedly went to meet this superior in the highest rank and introduced myself to him as I was a new comer.He said,\\"Yes,I recognize you.Got your feet wet?\\"I lowered my head to look at my wet trouser legs and with a helpless tone,I said,\\"Yeah,It's raining cats and dogs,isn't it?\\"Gazing at me for a moment,the chief boss said nothing with a amile. Later on, I mentioned the incident of meeting the chief boss to my colleague. Hence I learnt that I had made a big fool of myself. It turns out that \\"Get one's feet wet\\" is an American slang , with the meaning of reaching the state of affairs.\\" However, I regarded myself as humorous and replied with a slang sentence, which is seldom used now, describing the rain falling heavily. This was completely off the point. I am lucky that the chief boss is really gentle and did not point it out at once. Question: \\"It's raining cats and dogs.\\" Means   _  .

This is, of course, wrong but it happens. In general, the boys know they are bigger and stronger than you are, so they can make fun of you and make you cry and then laugh about it. If you let them see that they are hurting you, they will only do it more. It isn't that they want to hurt you; they simply want to make themselves feel superior . It's stupid, but it is common.

Is Surrounded by Henrico and Chesterfield counties, the city is located at the intersections of Interstate 95 and Interstate 64, and encircled by Interstate 295 and Virginia State Route 288. a good answer to this question?","output":"While the statement provided does give some useful information about the location of Richmond, Virginia, it doesn't specifically answer the question about Richmond's southwestern suburb. To provide a more detailed and relevant answer, let's explore the suburbs in and around Richmond. Richmond, the capital city of Virginia, is indeed surrounded by Henrico and Chesterfield counties, and its strategic location at the intersections of Interstate 95 and Interstate 64 facilitates efficient connectivity within the region. The city is further bolstered by the presence of Interstate 295 and Virginia State Route 288, which offer easy access to various suburbs and neighboring areas. In terms of Richmond's southwestern suburb, that title belongs to Midlothian, which is a part of Chesterfield County. Midlothian is located approximately 15 miles southwest of Richmond's downtown area and is easily accessible via the Midlothian Turnpike (US Route 60) and the Powhite Parkway (Virginia State Route 76). The suburb originated as a mining village in the early 18th century, and over time, it transformed into one of Richmond's thriving suburban areas. Midlothian offers a mix of residential housing, commercial centers, and recreational facilities, making it an attractive place to live for families and professionals alike. The area boasts excellent schools, including both public and private institutions. Midlothian's parks, such as Robious Landing Park and Midlothian Mines Park, provide ample opportunities for residents to enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and sports. Moreover, the suburb is home to shopping centers like Westchester Commons and the Village at Swift Creek, where residents can find a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and entertainment options. In addition, Midlothian has a rich history that can be explored at sites like the Midlothian Mines Park, which preserves remnants of the coal mining heritage of the region. In conclusion, while the original statement provided valuable information about Richmond's location, an accurate and detailed answer to the question about the city's southwestern suburb should discuss Midlothian, a thriving suburban community in Chesterfield County, known for its residential neighborhoods, excellent schools, parks, shopping centers, and historical significance."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Vampires: The Turning Movie plot: For many centuries, the phi song neng (vampires who have vowed never to drink human blood) have lived among the villages of the Far East. One day over 800 years ago, a young human warlord named Niran fell in love with one of the song neng, a woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked and bit Niran during a Songkran (New Year) solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. From Niran's bloodline have come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill for pleasure). Only Sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. Doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as well as jai tham, into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and thus wipe out all the vampires in Thailand. Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are vacationing in Thailand during this year's Songkran festival. Connor, trained since childhood in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), takes Amanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone. On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr Nice Guy (Dom Hetrakul) offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to leave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him.

Tom was infected with human papillomavirus, while Chris was infected with hepatitis.  Which brother had a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection? Answer:","output":"To determine which brother has a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection, we need to consider the characteristics of the viruses they are infected with. Step 1: Research human papillomavirus (HPV) characteristics HPV is a group of more than 200 related viruses. Some strains cause warts (papillomas) while others can lead to cancers, primarily cervical cancer. HPV infections are usually self-limiting, meaning the body's immune system can clear the infection over time. However, some strains of HPV can persist and develop into chronic infections. Step 2: Research hepatitis characteristics Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver primarily caused by viral infections. There are five main types of hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Hepatitis A and E are usually acute infections that do not become chronic. However, hepatitis B and C can lead to chronic infections in a significant percentage of infected individuals. Chronic hepatitis infection can result in progressive liver disease, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. Step 3: Compare the likelihood of chronic infection While both HPV and hepatitis viruses can potentially lead to chronic infections, the likelihood of developing a chronic infection is generally higher for hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B and C. Considering that Tom is infected with HPV and Chris is infected with hepatitis, without knowing the specific type of hepatitis, we can still conclude that: Answer: Chris has a higher chance of developing a chronic viral infection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Bob Corker (R-TN)  speaks with reporters after announcing  his  retirement at the conclusion of  his  term on Capitol Hill in Washington  U.S.  September 26  2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein WASHINGTON (Reuters)  - U.S. Senator Bob Corker   the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  said on Tuesday he will not run for re-election  a blow to a party already struggling to balance divisions between mainstream and more populist wings. An establishment Republican   Corker  has been criticized from the right  and a conservative activist had already announced a primary challenge. But he was expected to keep the seat  and had amassed a 7.5 million campaign war chest.  Corker  has ruled out running for governor of Tennessee. âI have no idea what Iâm going to do. No idea whatsoever â  Corker  said in an interview. But he said he was not leaving out of frustration over deep party divides that have often paralyzed Congress.  Corker  announced  his  retirement on the day of the failure of the latest Republican effort to repeal former Democratic President Barack Obamaâs healthcare law. âI am not going to be one of the people who leaves here badmouthing what is one of the greatest privileges of oneâs life â  Corker  said. He said he realized he was ready to retire on Aug. 24 during a factory groundbreaking in Clarksville  Tennessee  and almost announced his decision at least twice before Tuesday.  Corker  said that he made his announcement now to allow a strong candidate time to enter the Senate race.  Corker  is the first senator to announce  his  retirement ahead of the 2018 mid-term elections  when one-third of the 100-seat chamber will be up for grabs. Tennessee is a solidly Republican state and the party  which currently holds a 52-seat majority in the Senate  is favored to keep his seat. In his official announcement   Corker  said that âafter much thought  consideration and family discussionâ over the past year  he and his wife Elizabeth âhave decided that I will leave the United States Senate when my term expires at the end of 2018.â  Sen.

After the exchange  the two men had an hour-long meeting at the White House this month that  Corker  has described as a wide-ranging and friendly discussion.  Corker  will remain chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee until he leaves in January 2019. He said he wanted the panel to address issues including Secretary of State Rex Tillersonâs State Department reorganization  food aid reform  and the fight against human trafficking and modern slavery.  Corker  said the committee would address the international nuclear agreement with Iran  as Trump faces a mid-October deadline for deciding whether to certify that Tehran is complying with that pact. That decision could force Congress to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.  Corker  would not say whether Trump had decided to certify or not. Output:","output":"Sen.

With the help of his Peruvian friend Ricardo, Oliver, an American hedge fund banker, buys debts owed by the Peruvian government to landowners.  Though the deals are lucrative, Ricardo has lingering doubts about whether they are helping Peruvians.  At the same time, Maria, a nurse at an underfunded hospital in Lima, cares for her elderly, ailing mother, Gloria.  Though Gloria needs hospital care, Maria can not convince her superior, Dr. Cerrón, to admit her, as Gloria's illness is not life-threatening.  In the Andes, a mountain farmer, Florentino, struggles to convince his neighbors not to sell their ancestral land to Caravedo, a developer who has promised to bring modernization and jobs to the area.  Florentino has a strained relationship with his son, Diego, who dreams of being a pilot. Oliver's boss, Nathan, tells him they need to pull out of Peru, as the company needs an immediate influx of money.

Though his family is distraught that he is returning again to Peru, Oliver tells his wife he must close the deal or all of their previous sacrifices will be for nothing.  Oliver recruits Ricardo to research Caravedo.  After Oliver aggressively pressures the Peruvian finance minister to repay debts, Ricardo walks away from the Caravedo deal.  He returns shortly but demands Oliver promise to abort any potential deals with Caravedo if they turn out to be exploitative.

Max's sister Beatrice and brother-in-law Giles convince him to revive his custom of hosting an annual costume ball at the estate. Mrs. Danvers suggests Mrs. de Winter replicate a dress worn by a family ancestor in a portrait hanging in the gallery. The girl complies, unaware the same costume was worn by Rebecca to much acclaim shortly before her death the previous year.

Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell.

Use evidence from the fact that if an object reflects a light of a certain color then the object appears to be that color to answer this question: \\"What is the most sensible reason why a stove is often just white?\\"","output":"A stove is often white because of practical, aesthetic, and energy efficiency reasons. These factors are directly related to the fact that when an object reflects a certain color of light, it appears to be that color. In the case of a white stove, these aspects predominantly involve light reflection, heat management, and easy integration into various kitchen designs. 1. Light Reflection: White color is known to be a combination of all the colors within the visible light spectrum. When white light falls upon an object, the object appears to be the color it best reflects while it absorbs the other colors. White objects, including stoves, reflect the entire spectrum of visible light, which is why they appear white to the human eye. As a result of this high level of light reflection, a white stove can brighten up a space, making it seem more spacious, open, and welcoming. This is especially beneficial in kitchens with limited access to natural light. 2. Heat Management: The color white is known for its excellent heat resistance due to its light-reflecting properties. Darker colors typically absorb more heat from their surroundings, whereas lighter colors, like white, can keep surfaces cooler by reflecting the heat. Stoves often produce a significant amount of heat during use. By having a white surface, a stove can maintain lower temperatures and contribute to a cooler and more comfortable kitchen environment. It is worth mentioning that while the exterior of the stove is white, the interior structure often contains insulation to prevent heat from being transferred to the outer surface. 3. Aesthetic Appeal and Versatility: Aesthetically, white is a versatile color that easily complements various kitchen designs and color schemes. It is a timeless, classic choice that remains popular and adaptable to modern and traditional styles. White stoves are neutral, allowing homeowners to focus on other elements of their kitchen decor to create custom and unique spaces. Additionally, when kitchen surfaces and appliances are white, stains or dirt become more noticeable, which can serve as an advantage because it encourages cleanliness and upkeep.  In conclusion, a stove is often white because it reflects a large amount of visible light, improving the overall appearance and ambiance of a kitchen. Its excellent heat-reflecting properties contribute to a more comfortable working environment and assist in maintaining lower surface temperatures. Furthermore, the aesthetic versatility of white makes it a suitable choice for various kitchen styles, promoting cleanliness and easy maintenance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: The Golden State Warriors’ improbable comeback from a 3-1 series deficit in the Western Conference finals Monday night gripped basketball fans everywhere. But it left three distinct groups feeling especially overjoyed. One was the Warriors themselves, who found a way to keep their record-breaking season alive. The second was the NBA, which is all but guaranteed sky-high ratings for Golden State’s Finals rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The third was a collection of NBA fans more than 600 miles from the site of Monday night’s game, who were openly and enthusiastically rooting for the Oklahoma City Thunder to lose: the people of the scorned basketball city of Seattle. “If they had gotten swept, sure, we would’ve liked that they lost,” said Paul Rogers, an editor and senior writer with Sonics Rising, a blog dedicated to bringing the NBA back to Seattle. “But the fact that they were up 3-1, then lost? It will sound petty, but to me, it’s almost better that way,” For fans of the Seattle SuperSonics, who lost their franchise when it relocated to Oklahoma City in 2008, the feelings of anger and resentment haven’t dimmed much with the passing of time. For some, they may have only gotten stronger. Rogers, who is 47 years old, didn’t try to hide his satisfaction at the Thunder’s season-ending loss. In fact, he acknowledged that he’d only really begun to pay attention to the Western Conference finals once Oklahoma City lost control of its commanding 3-1 lead in the series. He wasn’t alone in feeling that way. On Saturday, Mariners fans at Safeco Field saved their loudest cheers of the night for when the final score from the Thunder’s Game 6 loss flashed on the jumbotron. Monday night at Stout, a bar in Seattle’s Capitol Hill where 33-year-old salesman Miles DeCaro watched Game 7, about two-thirds of the 300 patrons were wearing Sonics or Warriors gear. “There might’ve been one person in the room cheering for the Thunder,” DeCaro said. “More than anything, we all just feel relieved. I’m happy the Warriors succeeded—and the Thunder did not.” All of which underlines that many Seattle fans are far from over the franchise’s abrupt relocation to Oklahoma, which followed the sale of the team in 2006 to Oklahoma City businessman Clayton Bennett, who subsequently failed to secure the public funding necessary to build a new stadium for the Sonics. For eight years, a rabidly passionate fan base here has been without a franchise, leaving a legion of former Sonics followers in the NBA wilderness. Rachel Engrissei, a 33-year-old recruiter for a staffing agency, said the city’s basketball fans face a dilemma: They want a team to replace the Sonics, but they don’t want it to come at the expense of another city that would have to endure a similar heartache. “The situation came up in Sacramento a couple years ago, and we had a chance to get another team,” said Engrissei, whose father stopped watching the NBA after the Sonics vanished. “Everyone wants another team, but I didn’t want to take that away from them, because I know how that feels. They’d view us the same way we view Oklahoma City now.” Golden State’s victory derailed what would’ve been a matchup between a pair of cities that have lived through the consequences of relocation. While Oklahoma City got the Thunder from Seattle in 2008, Cleveland lost its NFL team, the Browns, to Baltimore 20 years ago, in 1996. Both situations were especially tough for the vacated cities because of how quickly the teams found success after moving. The Ravens won the Super Bowl five seasons after leaving Cleveland—a city that hasn’t won a major championship since 1964—while Oklahoma City has become a perennial NBA power with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook on the roster, reaching the Finals just four seasons after relocating. Seattle’s feelings about Durant, who won Rookie of the Year during the Sonics’ final season in Seattle, are complicated. Fans seem to like and root for him personally, though those sentiments are generally overridden by a stronger desire to see the Thunder lose by any means necessary. “When I see disappointment in his face, I’m not happy about it, because we like Kevin. He even came back here a few years ago to play in a charity basketball game,” said Rogers, the Sonics Rising editor. “It’s just really hard to separate him from Oklahoma City. That’s why we’d like to see him move to another team, so we can cheer for him again.” This ambivalence isn’t reserved for Durant. Engrissei says she essentially refused to talk about the Thunder with a cousin who lived in Oklahoma because the issue remains such a sore spot for her. DeCaro says he still won’t buy Starbucks because he resents the company’s chief executive, Howard Schultz, for selling the team to Bennett in 2006. He once turned down a free ticket to watch a playoff game in Oklahoma City in 2012 because of his feelings about the move, though he did buy a ticket to Game 2 of the Warriors-Thunder series and posed for photos wearing Sonics gear in the crowd. The Thunder’s collapse from 3-1 up in the series meant Seattle fans were saved the pain of 2012, when they had to watch their former team reach the Finals just four years after leaving. But the fact that Seattleites continue to cringe each time Oklahoma City—or Choklahoma City, as it’s known here—makes a deep playoff run shows how much some people still care. Spencer Hawes is a perfect example.

Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species A, the adult individuals had high body mass on average. In the second species, species B, the adult individuals had low body mass on average.  Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.

I wish they would have taken more time on this movie. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light.  The step-by-step thought process is as follows: 1. We must first understand the user's request, which is to analyze a product review and determine whether it presents the product in a flattering or an unflattering way.  2. The user shared a review of a movie. The title mentions that it is \\"Not very intriguing\\", which is negative in nature. 3. After reading the review's content, we can see they mention \\"Trailer tricked me\\". This indicates dissatisfaction as the movie didn't meet the expectations set by the trailer. 4. The review also said \\"Movie was vague\\" which means the viewer found the plot unclear or confusing, which is generally not a positive point in most contexts. 5. The phrase \\"There were no scary parts really\\" suggests the movie could be from the horror genre. The reviewer felt that the movie didn't fulfill the genre's fundamental requirement of delivering scares effectively.  6. Finally, the sentence \\"I wish they would have taken more time on this movie\\" implies the user thinks the movie was rushed and could have been executed better. 7. All these points suggest negative feedback towards the product (the movie).  Based on these interpretations, we can safely say that the review portrays the product in an unflattering light."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A look at one minority leadership strategy—partisan opposition—may suggest why it might be employed in specific circumstances.

By stalling action on the majority party's agenda, the minority leader may be able to launch a campaign against a \\"do-nothing Congress\\" and convince enough voters to put his party back in charge of the House.

Step 1: Understand the given text The given text informs us about the emotions and self-esteem of two characters, Patricia and Jessica. Patricia feels unlovable, and Jessica feels loved. The text needs to be continued, exploring the reasons behind their distinct self-esteem levels. Step 2: Consider the OPT statement The OPT statement suggests that both Patricia and Jessica have very high self-esteem, but it doesn't seamlessly fit the context since Patricia feels unlovable. Instead, we can use the idea of self-esteem and adapt it to more appropriately explain their feelings. Step 3: Develop the continuation of the text To continue the text, we can focus on the factors that contributed to their self-esteem levels and give more insight into their individual experiences. Continuation:  Patricia had always struggled with low self-esteem due to her troubled upbringing and constant comparison to her high-achieving siblings. She would often find herself questioning her worth and doubting her ability to be loved by others. This persistent self-criticism had a significant impact on her relationships and overall happiness.

Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus.

After the end of World War II, the three go for different lives: Nicola in Nocera Inferiore (southern Italy), Antonio in Rome and Gianni in Pavia. Later, both Antonio and Gianni fall in love with young Luciana (Sandrelli), and through their relationships go back to the history of post-war Italy, along with the related hopes and disappointments. Gianni, now a lawyer's assistant, moves to Rome and arranges to marry the semi-illiterate daughter of a construction tycoon with questionable fame, a former fascist who managed to get good connections with the pro-American conservative Christian democratic party dominating public life (and building licenses) in post-war Italy. His wife, resenting her inadequacy, tries to turn into the woman he longs for but ultimately fails and dies in a car accident. Antonio, worker in a hospital, has instead remained loyal to the ideals of their youth, and is now a fervent communist activist. Nicola, the most intellectual of the trio, leaves Nocera and his family and moves to Rome, too, to try win a fortune on the famous TV quiz Lascia o raddoppia.

Irish Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Emerald Fury\\" --- - Act I: Set in the bustling streets of Dublin, Ireland, the film begins with an introduction to our protagonist, Sean Gallagher (played by Colin Farrell), an ex-member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who has since left the organization and embraced a peaceful farmer's life. Sean, with his wife, Maura, and their young daughter, Aoife, struggles to make ends meet by managing their small family farm. Meanwhile, The Black Organization, a sinister and secretive international crime syndicate, has established a strong foothold in Ireland. The group consists of members from various criminal backgrounds, controlled by the enigmatic and ruthless leader, Viktor Salazar (played by Javier Bardem). They traffic in illegal arms, drugs, and human smuggling, causing devastating damage throughout the city. One night, Sean and Maura attend a traditional Irish music concert at a local pub. Unbeknownst to them, The Black Organization learns about the event and decides to teach the Irish a lesson about who is in charge now. Equipped with a deadly machine gun, the syndicate's henchmen storm into the pub and open fire on the unsuspecting crowd, causing mass casualties and chaos. - Act II: Sean, who narrowly escapes the bloodbath with Maura, vows to seek justice for the innocent lives lost and bring down The Black Organization. He teams up with Siobhan O'Rourke (played by Saoirse Ronan), a tough-as-nails detective from An Garda Síochána, the Irish police force, who has her own vendetta against the crime syndicate. Together, they must navigate the dangerous criminal underworld to uncover the organization's power structure and disrupt its operations. To infiltrate the ranks of The Black Organization, Sean and Siobhan devise a plan to become valuable assets by offering intelligence on IRA operations. Their cunning ploy gathers the attention of Salazar, who sends his trusted subordinates, James and Killian (played by Cillian Murphy and Liam Cunningham), to test Sean and Siobhan's loyalty. Sean and Siobhan are tasked with assassinating a high-ranking IRA leader, which will not only push them deeper into the criminal world but complicate Sean's ties with his former comrades. Despite the moral dilemma, they must complete the mission to gain Salazar's trust and uncover the inner workings of The Black Organization. - Act III: Success in their mission earns Sean and Siobhan access to Salazar's inner circle. With time running out before the syndicate executes a massive attack, our protagonists race against the clock to gather vital information. Along the way, they discover shocking connections between The Black Organization and corrupt Irish politicians, uncovering a larger conspiracy at play. As they prepare their evidence for the authorities, Sean and Siobhan are discovered as double agents and captured by Salazar's henchmen. In a suspenseful standoff, the two manage to break free, and a high-octane chase ensues, culminating in an intense final showdown between Sean and Salazar. Using his military experience and cunning wit, Sean is able to outsmart Salazar and subdue the villain, presenting the gathered evidence to the authorities. With Salazar's defeat, The Black Organization crumbles, and the criminal underworld in Ireland is impacted significantly. - Epilogue: The film ends with Sean, Maura, and Aoife visiting the grave of Siobhan, who sacrificed her life during the final standoff ensuring Salazar's defeat. Reflecting on the fruits of their labor, Sean is a changed man, discovering that real power lies not in violence but in the courage, compassion, and dedication to protecting his loved ones and community. \\"Emerald Fury\\" is a thrilling, action-packed tale of resilience, love, and the unbreakable spirit of Ireland. With an all-star cast and masterful storytelling, the film promises to be a box office sensation and a fitting tribute to the strength and determination of the Irish people."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her. Pilar dies before Manuel can embark on his journey, but with the aid of traitorous smuggler Carlos (Raymond Pelligrin) Captain Vinolas keeps up the pretence that she still lives so that he can lure Manuel back to Spain and ambush him. Although a sympathetic priest (Omar Sharif) advises Manuel that he's being tricked, Manuel determines to return at all costs. Aware of the trap that's been set for him, Manuel engages the police in a fire fight, wounding Vinolas, killing Carlos and dying himself in the process.In 1966, Behold a Pale Horse was scheduled to be telecast on a major American network, but was cancelled at the last minute, reportedly at the behest of the Spanish government.

Washington (CNN) -- One of the most famous veterans of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" has joined the ranks of recently injured members of the military at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Former Sen. Bob Dole was so badly wounded 65 years ago that he almost didn't make it off the battlefield. Now, he is recovering from surgery alongside troops injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"I'm just sort of one of the group. We show up at 10 o'clock and do our stuff,\\" Dole said as he pedaled a stationary bike during a morning physical therapy session. Dole, who turns 87 this month, is at Walter Reed for rehabilitation connected to knee replacement surgery. A bout with pneumonia lengthened his post-op recuperation, so he's been with the young troops since they arrived from the battlefield. \\"If they're wounded on one day, they can be in OPTIONS: - Afghanistan the third day. - Bob Dole the third day. - CNN the third day. - Dole the third day. - Greatest Generation the third day. - Iraq the third day. - Walter Reed the third day. - Walter Reed Army Medical Center the third day. - Washington the third day. - World War II the third day.","output":"The most plausible ending to the sentence considering the context would be: \\"If they're wounded on one day, they can be in Walter Reed the third day.\\" This choice fits the context as it refers to the military members who are wounded and would potentially require medical attention at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the institution already discussed throughout the report. The other options may be relevant to parts of the text, but they do not logically complete the specific sentence in question. For example, saying they may be in \\"Afghanistan\\" or \\"Iraq\\" on the third day would not make sense if they were wounded and require medical attention. The location mentioned must relate to a place of healing or recovery, hence Walter Reed being the most suitable option. This highlights how Bob Dole is recovering alongside young troops who are also being treated and rehabilitated at the same facility, adding to the inclusive sense of camaraderie and shared experience emphasized in the text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: (I) yes (II) it is not possible to tell (III) no","output":"(I) Yes The statement \\"An old man is sitting on a stoop while people walk towards him with groceries.\\" clearly illustrates the situation in which an old man is seated, presumably on the steps of a building, and people are approaching him carrying groceries. From the information provided, we can gather that there are multiple individuals (people), they are walking, and they are carrying groceries. Additionally, the object of their approach is specified as the old man. Now, let's examine the alternate statement: \\"People walk towards an old man who is sitting down.\\" This statement also describes a scenario where people are walking in the direction of an old man, who happens to be in a seated position. The emphasis here is on the fact that they are moving towards the old man, and it is mentioned that he is sitting down. Although it doesn't explicitly mention the presence of a stoop or the people carrying groceries, the crux of the situation remains the same: people are walking towards an old man who is seated. Based on the information given in both statements, it can be concluded that they are logically connected and describe essentially the same situation. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the answer is (I) yes. The latter statement, although slightly less detailed than the former, still captures the primary aspects of the scene: people walking towards a seated old man."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process:  - Coal is burned - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic -   suppose wind energy becomes less viable happens, how will it affect MORE acid rain.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If wind energy becomes less viable, it will indirectly impact a step of the process that leads to the formation of acid rain.  Wind energy is a clean and renewable energy source that does not contribute to the production of greenhouse gases or pollutants during operation. If wind energy becomes less viable, the overall share of clean energy in the energy mix would decrease. Consequently, there might be an increased dependence on fossil fuels, such as coal, for meeting the energy demand. As mentioned in the question, coal is burned during the electricity generation process, and sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides, which are then released into the atmosphere. These reactions ultimately contribute to the formation of sulfuric acid, causing acid rain. By relying more on coal and other fossil fuels, the emissions of sulfur oxides would increase, leading to a higher concentration of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, thus resulting in more intense or frequent acid rain events. In this case, the reduction in wind energy viability does not directly impact any step of the process that causes acid rain. However, it indirectly contributes to an increase in acid rain by potentially leading to a higher reliance on coal and other fossil fuels as energy sources, intensifying the overall process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen.  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break.

Write a text based on this summary: migrant workers in india s northeast block road with bodies to protest attacks Text:","output":"In Northeast India, a group of migrant workers took a drastic measure to voice their grievances by blocking a major road with the corpses of their deceased colleagues. This act of protest was performed as a response to the ongoing violence and attacks targeted towards them in the region. Migrant laborers have been facing numerous difficulties in India's northeast, including discrimination, social exclusion, and the constant threat of brutal assaults. The recent series of attacks on these vulnerable individuals has led to a growing sense of insecurity and fear among the migrant worker community. As a desperate measure to draw attention to their plight, these workers chose to use the bodies of their fallen comrades to obstruct the road, causing significant disruptions to traffic. By resorting to such a shocking and provocative method, they hoped to bring the issue of their safety and wellbeing to the forefront of public consciousness. The protest did not go unnoticed, as local authorities were forced to address the situation. The unfolding events have since sparked discussions on the matter, urging for the proper authorities to take action and guarantee the protection of migrant laborers in the region. Many human rights activists are now joining the call for justice, emphasizing the need to address the systemic issues faced by migrants and establish proper avenues to hold the perpetrators accountable. Moreover, this incident sheds light on the broader implications of the difficulties faced by migrant workers not only in Northeast India but across the nation. It highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of their vulnerability, such as the lack of legal protections, secure jobs, and social inclusion. In conclusion, the act of blocking a road with the bodies of deceased colleagues showcases the desperation and frustration of migrant workers in Northeast India. Their act of protest is a plea for safety and an end to the violence they face daily. It serves as a reminder to society and government institutions of the urgent need to provide effective solutions and safeguards to ensure the dignity and security of this marginalized group."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods.

Given the two facts above, what do most salamanders use to find a mate? A:","output":"Given the two facts presented above, most salamanders predominantly rely on their olfaction, or sense of smell, to locate and identify suitable mates for reproduction. This particular sense plays a crucial role in the courtship and mating behaviors of these amphibians, serving as a primary means of communication between individuals within the same species. Salamanders, being members of the class Amphibia, exhibit diverse methods of mate selection and reproduction depending on the species. Olfaction becomes particularly important in the process, as these animals need to find and recognize potential mates among their often densely-populated natural habitats. In the wild, chemical cues, commonly referred to as pheromones, are secreted by the animals, providing essential information to their conspecifics (individuals within the same species). Pheromones can convey essential details about the individual secreting them, including their species, sex, and reproductive status—whether they are sexually mature or receptive to mating. As salamanders use their olfaction to detect these chemicals in their surroundings, they can gather the necessary information during mate selection. This information is critical for ensuring the continuation of their species, by maximizing the chances of successful mating encounters and avoiding potential threats or conflicts. In addition to using their sense of smell for mate recognition and selection, salamanders also employ olfaction for other essential purposes. These might include foraging for food, perceiving predators in the environment, or navigating through their often complex habitats. As a result, the olfactory system of salamanders is highly evolved and specialized, enabling them to detect even the most subtle chemical cues present in their surroundings. To summarize, most salamanders use their olfaction or sense of smell, to locate and identify suitable mates for reproduction. By detecting and interpreting chemical cues (pheromones) in their environment, they are able to gather critical information about prospective partners, ultimately facilitating crucial reproductive behaviors and ensuring the continuation of their species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mike (Michael Simpson) and King Gizmo (John King), famous for their sample-based music in the 1980s and 1990s, and specifically for their work on the albums \\"Paul's Boutique\\" by the Beastie Boys, \\"Odelay\\" by Beck, the soundtrack to the film \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"MMMBop\\" by Hanson.  - DGC Records (an acronym for David Geffen Company) is an American record label that currently operates as a division of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, which is owned by Vivendi S.A..  - \`\` Debra '' is a song by Beck . He had originally attempted to record \`\` Debra '' with the Dust Brothers for Odelay , but he thought that it was too tongue - in - cheek . It was debuted main - stream in 1996 , and , as Beck noted , \`\` it became the centerpiece of the whole set . It was the song that people would react to more than the songs that they 'd heard on the radio . So we kept playing it and playing it . '' The song finally made it on to Midnite Vultures in 1999 . The song maintains a cult following . The song was covered by German industrial artist Kompressor . Kompressor 's version is called \`\` Kompressor Want To Get With You . ''  - \\"MMMBop\\" is a song written and performed by the American pop rock band Hanson from their 1997 album \\"Middle of Nowhere\\". The song was nominated for two Grammys at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1998, and is the band's most successful single to date. \\"MMMBop\\" was phenomenally successful, especially for a debut single, reaching number one in 27 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Mexico. In the United Kingdom, the song sold 710,000 copies and stayed at number one for 3 weeks.  - Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known mononymously as Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and multi-instrumentalist. He is mostly known for his musical composition, as well as a palette of sonic genres.  - Midnite Vultures is the fourth official studio album and seventh overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, released in November 1999 by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying musical styles, \\"Midnite Vultures\\" didn't achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough, \\"Odelay\\", though it was still critically and commercially well received.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A soundtrack, also written sound track, can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film or TV show; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound.  - Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records. Featuring production by the Dust Brothers, the album was recorded in Matt Dike's apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, and mixed at the Record Plant. Subsequent remixes were done at the Manhattan-based Record Plant Studios. The album is noted for being almost completely composed of samples, excluding the group's vocal output.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar).  - Odelay is the second official studio album and fifth overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, originally released on June 18, 1996, by DGC Records.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).

Says Its Chief Has Resigned OTTAWA — The Sino-Forest Corporation, a Chinese company that is the focus of a Canadian securities investigation, said on Sunday that its chairman and chief executive, Allen T.Y. Chan, had resigned. The announcement came after the Ontario Securities Commission halted trading in the company, which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, on Friday after finding that Sino-Forest might have inflated its revenue and exaggerated the value of its timberlands. In brief statement on Sunday, Sino-Forest said three other employees had been put on “administrative leave” and that the duties of a fourth employee had been restricted. The securities commission, which is Canada’s most significant market regulator, initially on Friday ordered Mr. Chan and four other Sino-Forest employees to resign. It withdrew that portion of its order, however, after concluding that such a step could not be taken without a hearing. Through a representative, Sino-Forest said that Mr. Chan had submitted his resignation to the board “within the past week” and that the four employees were the people named earlier by the securities commission. The value of Sino-Forest’s shares fell significantly in June after Muddy Waters Research issued an extensive report by a short-seller that called the forestry company an “established institutional fraud.” In Sunday’s announcement, Sino-Forest said that Mr. Chan had also stepped down as a director but added that he would assume the title of founding chairman emeritus. Mr. Chan will continue to assist a special committee of directors with their investigation into the Muddy Waters accusations, the statement said. As the company has previously suggested, the special committee’s inquiries have not been going smoothly over the last 10 weeks. “The company’s business is complex, the scope of the review is significant and there are enormous amounts of data that have been marshaled and are under review,” the announcement said. “In these circumstances, the independent committee has not yet reached any conclusions.” Earlier this summer, Sino-Forest dismissed the Muddy Waters findings as well as a lengthy report in The Globe and Mail newspaper that reached similar conclusions, if in a less inflammatory manner. On Sunday, Sino-Forest said the accusations by the securities regulator, “while unproven, are of a serious nature.” Mr. Chan has been succeeded by William E. Ardell, a director who is also leading the independent committee. Mr. Ardell was formerly the president and chief executive of Southam, once Canada’s largest newspaper publisher. After a holding company controlled by Conrad M. Black completed a gradual takeover of Southam in 1996, Mr. Black fired Mr. Ardell and assumed operating control of the newspaper chain. Southam has since changed hands two more times and no longer exists in its previous corporate form. Sino-Forest is one of several Chinese companies that came to be listed in Toronto by taking over a dormant Canadian company trading on the exchange. Such reverse-merger companies have become a subject of increasing concern for regulators in both Canada and the United States.","output":"Sino-Forest Corporation is a Chinese company that is being looked at by Canadian people who check if companies are following rules. The boss of the company, Allen Chan, has quit his job. This happened after some people in Canada stopped others from buying and selling the company's shares because they think Sino-Forest might have made their money and their land worth more than it really was. Some other workers in the company have also been asked to take a break or do different jobs for now. Mr. Chan is going to help the company with special work to find out if the information is true or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

(b). positive.","output":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be best understood by breaking down its components and examining the context of the message. Tweet: \\"@Pura_Candela awwww my poor babie still aint got better yet???\\" Here, \\"@\\" represents a mention that tags a user, in this case, \\"Pura_Candela\\". The user expressing the tweet is addressing them directly. Now, we examine the main components of the tweet: 1. \\"awwww\\": This is an expression of sympathy or affection, and it usually indicates a kind or caring sentiment towards someone or something. 2. \\"my poor babie\\": The user is showing concern or empathy for Pura_Candela, using the term \\"babie\\" as a term of endearment. 3. \\"still aint got better yet??\\": This indicates that the user is aware that Pura_Candela has not yet improved from their current situation (possibly regarding their health or well-being). Considering these elements, the tweet presents a mix of emotions. On one hand, the user demonstrates a caring and empathetic attitude towards Pura_Candela, which may indicate a positive sentiment. On the other hand, the tweet also acknowledges the unfortunate current state of Pura_Candela (not yet getting better), which introduces a negative sentiment. However, the user's primary intent seems to be to express concern and sympathy, which can be interpreted as positive rather than negative. As such, the sentiment can be categorized as: (b). positive. In summary, the tweet's sentiment can be identified as positive due to the user's empathy and genuine concern for Pura_Candela and their situation. Though it addresses an unfortunate circumstance, the message's central focus is the author's consideration and affection towards the mentioned user, which conveys a positive connotation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Polabian Slavs (Wends) settled in parts of England (Danelaw), apparently as Danish allies. Polabian-Pomeranian Slavs are also known to have even settled on Norse age Iceland. Saqaliba refers to the Slavic mercenaries and slaves in the medieval Arab world in North Africa, Sicily and Al-Andalus. Saqaliba served as caliph's guards. In the 12th century, there was intensification of Slavic piracy in the Baltics. The Wendish Crusade was started against the Polabian Slavs in 1147, as a part of the Northern Crusades. Niklot, pagan chief of the Slavic Obodrites, began his open resistance when Lothar III, Holy Roman Emperor, invaded Slavic lands. In August 1160 Niklot was killed and German colonization (Ostsiedlung) of the Elbe-Oder region began. In Hanoverian Wendland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Lusatia invaders started germanization. Early forms of germanization were described by German monks: Helmold in the manuscript Chronicon Slavorum and Adam of Bremen in Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. The Polabian language survived until the beginning of the 19th century in what is now the German state of Lower Saxony. In Eastern Germany, around 20% of Germans have Slavic paternal ancestry.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve -16*r - 15*r = -8*r for r, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the left-hand side of the equation. -16*r and -15*r are like terms, so you can add them together. (-16*r) + (-15*r) = -31*r Now the equation is -31*r = -8*r. Step 2: To isolate r, you need to get rid of the coefficients -31 and -8. To do this, add 8*r to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -8*r term. (-31*r) + (8*r) = (-8*r) + (8*r) This simplifies to: -23*r = 0 Step 3: Now, to isolate r, divide both sides by -23.

Let me help provide more context and break down the elements of the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"For a different vision of Old China, spend a few quiet moments in the classic Lou Lim Ieoc Garden.\\" This statement indicates that Lou Lim Ieoc Garden is a place associated with Old China and concerned with providing visitors quiet moments and classic experiences. Hypothesis: \\"The Lou Lim Ieoc Garden is full of wild dinosaurs.\\" This statement suggests that the Lou Lim Ieoc Garden is a place inhabited by wild dinosaurs. Now, let's analyze these statements and their relationship. 1. The premise provides information about the atmosphere and historic nature of the Lou Lim Ieoc Garden. It describes it as a place to experience Old China's essence in a tranquil setting. 2. The hypothesis claims that the garden is filled with wild dinosaurs. This statement is far-fetched and contradicts the premise describing the garden as a quiet, peaceful site. Based on this analysis, we cannot conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The fact that Lou Lim Ieoc Garden offers a unique vision of Old China and means to experience it in a serene environment does not imply the presence of wild dinosaurs.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was a revered institution in the caliphate? Context: The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).

Police didn't provide further details about the suspect's identity.      The latest arrest came as around 1,000 supporters of a far-right group marched through central London protesting the killing, clashing with a smaller group of anti-fascist demonstrators.      Police have already taken nine other suspects into custody, including the two main ones who were shot and wounded by officers at the scene of Wednesday's killing. Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, remain under armed guard in separate London hospitals. Four other men remain in custody at a London police station.      Witnesses say Rigby, who had served in Afghanistan, was walking near his barracks in southeast London's Woolwich area when he was run over by a vehicle and repeatedly stabbed with knives and meat cleavers.      The gruesome scene was recorded on witnesses' cellphones, and a video picked up by British media showed one of the two main suspects, holding a bloody knife and cleaver, making political statements and warning of more violence. Hard-line Muslim leaders have identified the man in the video as Adebolajo.      Kenyan officials have confirmed that Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya in 2010 with five others near the country's border with Somalia. Police believed Adebolajo was going to work with Somali militant group al-Shabab.      The killing in London has fed a spike in anti-Muslim sentiment in Britain, with police and activists reporting a surge in hate crimes, including violence and vandalism.      A mosque in the northern England town of Grimsby was firebombed Sunday night, according to the mosque's chairman, Diler Gharib, who told a local newspaper he was discussing how to thank his neighbors for the support they had shown his community in the past days when the building was hit with gasoline bombs.      Police said they arrested two people in connection with the incident.

Does the word \\"tone\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"tone\\" is used to convey similar, yet somewhat different meanings related to the manner or way a person is speaking. In the first sentence, \\"He spoke in a nervous tone of voice,\\" the word \\"tone\\" is used to describe the characteristics of the person's voice – in this case, nervousness. This might suggest that the person's voice was shaky, unsteady, or even soft, reflecting their emotional state. Here, \\"tone\\" specifically refers to the audible qualities of the voice that indicate the speaker's feelings or emotions. In the second sentence, \\"He began in a conversational tone,\\" the word \\"tone\\" is used to describe the approach or style of the person's speech. The phrase \\"conversational tone\\" implies that the speaker was attempting to engage in a casual, informal, friendly, or easygoing manner of speaking. In this context, \\"tone\\" refers more broadly to the speaker's attitude or demeanor, which encompasses not only the sound of their voice but also the choice of words, pacing, and other elements that could contribute to the overall communicative intent. In summary, while the word \\"tone\\" is used to describe certain aspects of a person's speech in both instances, it has a slightly different emphasis in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"tone\\" pertains to the emotional quality of the voice, whereas, in the second sentence, it relates to the style or manner of speech. Nonetheless, in both cases, \\"tone\\" contributes to a better understanding of how the speaker delivers their message, helping the listener to interpret the meaning and intent behind the words."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was born on May 19, 1991, in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania, and her journey of winning the show was not only full of hopes and impressions but also surrounded by lots of controversies and dramatic moments, which made the season quite memorable for the viewers. Brittani, a 19-year-old college student during her time on the show, was known for her unique, edgy look and intense emotional connection with the camera. The judges often raved about her pictures, pointing out their high-fashion, editorial quality. Throughout the competition, she consistently produced strong photographs and was once awarded with the first call-out — meaning her photograph was deemed the best of the week — in the competition's fourth week. Nonetheless, Brittani's time on America's Next Top Model was also marked by turmoil. She had a highly-publicized and dramatic altercation with another contestant, Alexandria Everett, during a challenge. This led to a heated confrontation with Tyra Banks, the show’s host and lead judge, who reprimanded her for acting unprofessionally. Strikingly, this episode became one of the season's most talked-about moments. Despite this scandal, Kline managed to make a comeback by apologizing sincerely for her behaviour and focusing on the competition. In the final episode, where Brittani Kline went head-to-head with Hannah Jones in a CoverGirl commercial shoot and a high-fashion runway show in Morocco, she stood out. Despite suffering a panic attack and initially struggling with her lines during the commercial shoot, she eventually overcame her nerves and delivered a wonderful performance. The judges were impressed with her resilience and determination. Even when walking on the runway for a high-fashion brand, she managed to maintain her grace and poise, all of which helped her secure her ultimate win.  Apart from a modeling contract with IMG Models (one of the biggest agencies in the world), a spread in Vogue Italia and a cover and spread in Beauty in Vogue, winning America's Next Top Model also gave Brittani Kline the opportunity to be a CoverGirl Cosmetics ambassador, earning a 100,000 contract with the renowned beauty brand. She continued to model after the show and found considerable success. Kline's victory in America's Next Top Model Season 16 is a testament to her splendid performance, dedication, and sheer talent in the modeling industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the faster movement would cause more friction and stress between the plates, leading to a greater build-up of energy.

Wright Electric said by removing the need for jet fuel, the price of travel could drop dramatically. British low-cost airline Easyjet has expressed its interest in the technology. \\"Easyjet has had discussions with Wright Electric and is actively providing an airline operator's perspective on the development of this exciting technology,\\" the airline told the BBC. However, significant hurdles need to be overcome if Wright Electric is to make the Wright One, pictured above, a reality. The company is relying heavily on innovation in battery technology continuing to improve at its current rate. If not, the firm will not be able to build in enough power to give the plane the range it needs. Industry experts are wary of the company's claims. Graham Warwick, technology editor of Aviation Weekly, said such technology was a \\"long way away\\". \\"The battery technology is not there yet,\\" he told the BBC. \\"It's projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon. And there's all the [safety] certification  - those rules are yet to be created, and that takes time.\\" The company is yet to produce a plane of its own and is instead working alongside American inventor Chip Yates, whose own electric aircraft, the Long-ESA, holds the world record for fastest electric aircraft. Wright Electric's competitors include aviation giant Airbus, which has been developing its electric two-seater plane E-Fan since 2014, and has stated plans to create its own short-haul electric aeroplane seating 70 to 90 passengers. Wright Electric is backed by Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's most highly-regarded start-up incubator programme. Alumni of the scheme include companies such as AirBnB, file storage company Dropbox and HR management software firm Zenefits. Wright Electric's goal, detailed in a presentation given to potential investors on Tuesday, is to make all short-haul flights electric-powered within the next 20 years, which would be about 30% of all flights made globally. The company said that as well as lower fuel costs for the airlines, the technology could have a major added benefit for the public. \\"Depending on how it's designed, you can have an electric plane that's substantially less loud than a fuel plane,\\" said Jeff Engler, Wright Electric's co-founder. Batteries would be charged separately, he said, meaning planes would not have to sit on the tarmac while power is replenished. \\"The way we've designed our plane is to have modular battery packs for quick swap using the same cargo container that's in a regular airplane,\\" Mr Engler said. \\"We want it to be as fast as possible, so airlines can keep their planes in the air as long as possible and cover their costs.\\" Other technology start-ups are seeking to innovate within the aviation industry.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai.

What is the US term for an area of land 160 acres (half a mile) square? What is the answer?","output":"In the United States, the term used for an area of land measuring 160 acres, or half a mile square, is a \\"quarter section.\\" This term comes from the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), which was established in 1785 to facilitate the organization and sale of public lands in the United States. The PLSS divides land into a grid of townships and sections. A township is typically a six by six-mile square, consisting of 36 sections, and each section is one square mile (640 acres) in size. A quarter section, as the name suggests, is a subdivision of a section, further dividing it into four equal parts of 160 acres each. These quarter sections are often used as a basis for land descriptions and property boundaries in rural areas, particularly in the Midwest and Western United States. The use of the quarter section as a land measurement unit facilitated the distribution of land to settlers and the eventual settling of the American frontier. The Homestead Act of 1862, for example, granted settlers up to 160 acres of land (a quarter section) if they met certain requirements, such as building a dwelling, cultivating crops, and residing on the land for a specific length of time. In conclusion, the US term for an area of land that is 160 acres or half a square mile in size is a \\"quarter section,\\" and it has its origins in the Public Land Survey System which was implemented to simplify land distribution and organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that died on October 17th? is inside the article: De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt.

Q:I have a new situation: Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match. Both have different preferences for the type of ball used. Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. Thomas, on the other hand, prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more.  But I can use this background: The balls used in squash are small rubber balls that can differ in terms of diameter, weight and softness. These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4]  What is an answer for this question: Which player enjoys the speed of game less as it progresses? A:","output":"Joseph enjoys the speed of the game less as it progresses. The main reason for this lies in their individual preferences for squash ball properties and how the game changes over time.  Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly, which typically means he enjoys playing with a softer squash ball. As the game progresses and players continuously hit the ball, it warms up and thus bounces more. This increase in bounce can result in a faster game, which deviates from Joseph's preference for a slower pace. In colder climates and earlier stages of the game before the ball is adequately warmed up, Joseph would enjoy the game more since the ball would travel slowly and have less bounce. On the other hand, Thomas prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more. His preference aligns well with the natural progression of a typical squash game. As the ball warms up and starts bouncing more (and traveling more quickly), the game speed increases, which goes hand in hand with Thomas's preference. Therefore, as the game progresses and the ball warms up, Joseph enjoys the speed of the game less, as it moves away from his preferred slower playstyle with less bounce. Thomas, conversely, experiences increased enjoyment due to the game becoming faster and more aligned with his preferences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Commit to being yourself instead of trying to change your personality for him. If he doesn’t appreciate your genuine personality, he’s definitely not worth your time.  Make a list of all your strengths, and read it daily to give yourself a confidence boost.  When you’re feeling unsure, stop for a moment and remember a time when you felt super confident. Try to recall the sights, sounds, and smells of that moment. Bringing yourself back to a moment of high confidence can help you feel more confident in the present.  Listen to some confidence-boosting jams! You can even make a “confidence playlist” to psych yourself up. Part of being silly is being completely present. Instead of worrying about being funny or saying the right thing, focus on having a great time with your boyfriend.  If you feel yourself starting to worry, focus on your breathing. Then, bring your attention to what you see, feel and hear around you.  Notice your boyfriend’s smile, the feeling of his hand in yours, and the sound of his laugh. If you feel the urge to do something silly, do it right away. After all, being silly is about letting go. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to hold back. Try channeling your goofy inner child who doesn’t care what others think.  If you’re sitting by the lake, start a splashing war! Propose an impromptu game of hide-and-seek or tag. While there’s definitely a time for seriousness, there’s also a time to laugh and be goofy. Not every conversation with your boyfriend needs to be deep and emotional. Having silly, lighthearted interactions is important for a strong relationship, too. Don’t take yourself too seriously, either. It’s ok to act like a fool sometimes. In fact, it can actually be pretty fun!

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A convicted rapist seeking to prove his innocence with a new DNA test lost his appeal Thursday at the Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court case involved a crime in which post-conviction DNA testing was available. The justices ruled 5-4 that inmates cannot use a federal civil rights law to press for advanced DNA testing that was unavailable at the time of the crime. Forty-four states and the federal government have laws allowing post-conviction access to biological evidence for such testing, but that number does not include Alaska, where William Osborne was sentenced 15 years ago for a vicious attack on an Anchorage woman.","output":"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday, in a 5-4 decision, that inmates cannot use a federal civil rights law to press for advanced DNA testing that was unavailable at the time of the crime. This case involves William Osborne, who was convicted of a brutal attack on an Anchorage woman 15 years ago and was seeking to prove his innocence through post-conviction DNA testing. The ruling is significant because it affects the rights of inmates applying for DNA testing in an attempt to establish their innocence in states where there are no specific laws providing access to biological evidence for such tests. At the time of Osborne's conviction, the available DNA testing methods were less sophisticated than the ones currently in use. He requested a more advanced DNA test, which potentially could exonerate him. However, the state of Alaska is one of six states that do not have specific laws allowing post-conviction access to biological evidence for DNA testing (the other 44 states and the federal government do have such laws). The Supreme Court's decision effectively prevents inmates like Osborne from seeking relief through federal civil rights laws, barring them from accessing more advanced DNA testing techniques to reexamine the biological evidence. The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, argued that granting requests for advanced DNA testing could undermine the states' interest in the finality of their criminal judgments and overwhelm state courts with requests for DNA testing. Furthermore, the majority argued that leaving the decision to the states to establish their laws regarding DNA testing would promote the best result due to the variations in methodology, costs, and limitations of the technology. On the other hand, the dissenting opinion, written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer, argued that denying the opportunity for potentially decisive DNA evidence to be retested would lead to a grave injustice and an erosion of public confidence in the criminal justice system. They emphasized that DNA evidence has been crucial in exonerating innocent individuals who had been wrongfully convicted. This Supreme Court decision highlights the ongoing debate over the role of DNA testing in the criminal justice system and the extent to which it should be available to those seeking to establish their innocence. It also underscores the importance of state-level legislation in determining the rights of inmates to access such technology. By denying inmates the ability to utilize federal civil rights laws to push for advanced DNA testing, the Court places the onus on individual states to establish their laws on the matter. In conclusion, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in this case significantly impacts the rights of inmates to access advanced DNA testing that was unavailable at the time of their crimes. In states like Alaska, where there is no law granting post-conviction access to biological evidence for DNA testing, inmates seeking to prove their innocence will not be able to rely on federal civil rights laws as a means to access this potentially crucial evidence. The decision highlights the importance of state-level legislation in ensuring inmates' rights to DNA testing, underscoring the ongoing debate over the role of such testing in the criminal justice system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  Peter visited two mountain ranges last summer. The Ozarks in Missouri, and the  more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more.  Which mountains have a larger percent of sedimentary rock? The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine which mountain range has a larger percentage of sedimentary rock, we should start by researching information about the geological composition of each range. Step 1: Research the geology of the Ozarks and the Colorado Rockies - The Ozarks are a region of plateaus, comprised of mostly limestone and dolomite, which are sedimentary rocks.  - The Colorado Rockies are composed of various rock types, including sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks.  Step 2: Determine the percentage of sedimentary rock in each mountain range - The Ozarks have a high percentage of sedimentary rock, as they are predominantly composed of limestone and dolomite. - The Colorado Rockies have a mix of different rock types, with sedimentary rocks being just one of the various types present. Based on this information, the mountain range with a larger percentage of sedimentary rock is the Ozarks in Missouri.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Sullana Province is a landlocked province in the Piura Region in northwestern Peru. It is the northernmost province in the Piura Region.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Manuel Arturo Odría Amoretti (November 26, 1896  February 18, 1974) was the President of Peru from 1948 to 1956, essentially ruling as a military dictator.  - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona.  - The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela.  - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river.  - Miguel Checa District is one of eight districts of the province Sullana in Peru . It was created by law on 10 November 1950 by the government of President Manuel A. Odría . The administrative center of the district is the village of Sojo which is approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) west of the town of Sullana on the Paita Highway . Of interest in Miguel Checa District are the archaeological site and huaca \`\` La Mariposa '' , and the colonial mansion \`\` Casa de Sojo '' . The district was named after Miguel Checa who built the \`\` Casa de Sojo '' in 1910 .  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Sullana is the name of the capital of the Sullana Province, in the north-western coastal plains of Peru on the Chira valley.  - Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as \\"Republic of the Equator\\"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland.  - The Amazon River (or ; Spanish and ) in South America is the largest river by discharge of water in the world, and according to some experts, the longest in length. The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazons most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the Mantaro River in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac confluence, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn confluences with the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters at Manaus, the river's largest city.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) Diuretics are drugs that can increase water loss by interfering with the recapture of solutes and water from the forming urine. They are often prescribed to lower blood pressure. Coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages are familiar diuretics. ADH, a 9-amino acid peptide released by the posterior pituitary, works to do the exact opposite. It promotes the recovery of water, decreases urine volume, and maintains plasma osmolarity and blood pressure. It does so by stimulating the movement of aquaporin proteins into the apical cell membrane of principal cells of the collecting ducts to form water channels, allowing the transcellular movement of water from the lumen of the collecting duct into the interstitial space in the medulla of the kidney by osmosis. From there, it enters the vasa recta capillaries to return to the circulation. Water is attracted by the high osmotic environment of the deep kidney medulla.   Choices:  - sedatives  - disassociates  - hallucinogens  - diuretics   A: Answer:","output":"Diuretics"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

The prisoners are Crawford (Jake Curran), a car thief, Floyd (Gil Kolirin), a neo-Nazi serial killer, Brandon (Tom McKay), who was wrongly convicted of murder, Chavez (Tamer Hassan), the leader of a crime organization and Willy (Christian Contreras), an undercover agent who is posing as a prisoner in order to get information from Chavez. While driving, their bus is rammed by Three Finger's truck and crashes in the woods of West Virginia, forcing them to continue on foot. Walter is badly injured, but Nate manages to rescue him from the truck before it explodes. They begin to follow Alex, and on the way, they find an abandoned armored truck. Chavez tells Nate to check the cab of the truck. Nate finds a set of keys and a gun. He secretly gives the gun to Walter, after handing the keys over to Chavez. Chavez uses the keys to open the back of the truck, and finds several bags of money. He intends to steal the money and demands that everyone carry two bags, but Walter refuses because of his injury. In a last-ditch effort to regain control of the situation, Walter pulls out the gun and tries to shoot Chavez. Unfortunately, the gun is not loaded and Chavez shoots and kills Walter. Chavez forces those left alive to carry the money and they continue on foot. Along the trail, they stumble upon a trap, set by Three Toes, Three Finger's son. They...

Let's break down the two sentences to further understand the similarities and differences between them: 1. He was born in Titograd (today Podgorica) in a family of musicians and grew up there. 2. He was born and grew up in Titograd (now Podgorica) in a family of musicians. Both sentences provide the following information: - The subject (a person, denoted by \\"He\\") was born in Titograd, which is now known as Podgorica. - The subject comes from a family of musicians. - The subject grew up in the same place where they were born, i.e., Titograd/Podgorica. The differences between the two sentences lie in the way they're structured and the words used to convey the same information. In the first sentence, the information about the change in the city's name is given within parentheses using the phrase \\"today Podgorica.\\" The sentence then directly states that the subject grew up in the same city by adding \\"and grew up there\\" to the end of the sentence. In the second sentence, the change in the city's name is mentioned in parentheses with the phrase \\"now Podgorica,\\" and the birth and growing up information are combined into one phrase: \\"He was born and grew up in Titograd (now Podgorica).\\" This slightly changes the sentence structure, but the overall meaning remains the same. In conclusion, both sentences mean the same and provide identical information about the subject.

For much of the past decade, Iran's nuclear weapons development program has been one of the top national security concerns for the United States. Even as we fought wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and hunted down al Qaeda's leaders, American intelligence officers, military and top diplomats have been working round the clock to prevent Iran from developing the bomb.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What allowed the language to be a factor?\\"  Context: \\"In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of Joe Pasternak. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler's increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The language became a factor in Universal's Deutsche Universal-Film AG productions due to several reasons: 1. Expansion to international markets: In 1926, Universal started producing films in Germany, later migrating to Hungary and Austria, reflecting their ambition to establish a presence in European markets. Producing films in local languages, such as German, Hungarian, or Polish, allowed the company to appeal to a wider audience in these regions and increase market share. 2. Advent of sound technology: The introduction of sound in films brought about a new challenge for global distribution as language barriers became more evident. Previously, silent films could be easily adapted for different markets using translated title cards. However, with the advent of sound, it became important for films to be produced in local languages to avoid alienating non-English speaking audiences, making language a significant factor in film production. 3. Independent distribution: In the US, Universal Pictures did not distribute Deutsche Universal-Film AG's productions, but some of these films were exhibited through other independent foreign-language film distributors based in New York without English subtitles. This limited their accessibility to American audiences but likely helped to cement their success in the target European markets, where English subtitles or dubbing would not have been necessary. 4. Political climate: The increasing domination of central Europe by Adolf Hitler in the 1930s had a significant impact on the film industry, including the operations of Deutsche Universal-Film AG. The unit's decision to produce films in languages other than English perhaps worked as a strategy to navigate the hostile political environment, with language serving as a tool to maintain a distinct identity and focus on catering to non-English speaking regions. In summary, the language became a factor in the productions of Deutsche Universal-Film AG due to the need to cater to international markets, the advent of sound technology, the responsibility of independent distributors to handle foreign-language films, and the tumultuous political climate in Europe at the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How you feel is controlled by many things. Your emotions can be affected by your personality, by the actions of others and by events around you. Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well. People often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy. In fact, sunlight makes us feel good. When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals   which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains   and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special \\"sunrooms\\" with artificial   lights have been built. People can go there and get \\"sunlight\\" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot.

Most units in this list are assigned to Air Force Materiel Command, however, a few reside in other Major Commands of the United States Air Force. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Most of the units go to the Air Force Materiel Command.","output":"Yes, from the provided paragraph, it can be concluded that the sentence \\"Most of the units go to the Air Force Materiel Command\\" is true. According to the text, \\"Most units in this list are assigned to Air Force Materiel Command...\\" The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is a major command of the United States Air Force (USAF). AFMC was created in 1992 through the amalgamation of the former Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and the former Air Force Systems Command (AFSC). The command conducts research, development, test and evaluation, and provides the acquisition and life cycle management services and logistics support necessary to keep Air Force weapon systems ready for war. Test squadrons, as implied by the paragraph, are a critical part of this system. They carry out the testing of new, experimental, or modified aircraft or aircraft systems to ensure their safety, efficiency, and effectiveness in the field. This may include extensive evaluations of flight capabilities, weapon systems, navigational systems, and other key equipment.  Being part of the Air Force Materiel Command indicates that these units are largely tasked with these kinds of operations: testing, evaluating, and improving Air Force equipment and systems. It suggests that these squadrons form an essential part of the USAF's infrastructure, allowing it to maintain its technological edge and operational readiness. However, the text also clarifies that \\"a few reside in other Major Commands of the United States Air Force\\". The Major Commands, or MAJCOMs, are the highest level of command in the USAF, just below the Air Staff. Each MAJCOM is given a specific mission and resources to carry out that mission. Therefore, some test squadrons may be assigned to commands that focus on different or specialized areas within the Air Force's broad mandate. While the specifics aren’t given as to what exactly these different commands are, it points to the diversity of roles and responsibilities within the Air Force's structure.

Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally.

The difference in wording between \\"in the TV series\\" and \\"on the television series\\" does not change the intended meaning of the sentences. Both phrases are commonly used to convey the same message: that Conlan Carter appeared in the mentioned television shows. Step 5: Conclude whether the sentences mean the same thing. Since the difference in wording does not alter the intended meaning of the sentences, I can conclude that these sentences indeed mean the same thing.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Range shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward. The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes, reptiles, and mammals. Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. The rate of warming appears to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt seals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears. A trend to decreasing sea ice coverage has occurred since observations began in the mid-twentieth century. The rate of decline observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted by climate models. Finally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water. Shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will disappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation.

Context: The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal. Question: How did the scientists put Keta into clinical death? - By putting her to sleep, lowering her temperature and draining her blood. - By surrounding her body with ice-bags and draining her blood. - By lowing her blood pressure and stopping her heart from beating. - By draining her blood, lowering her blood pressure and stopping her breathing. A:","output":"The scientists put Keta into clinical death by first putting her to sleep with a narcotic, then surrounding her body with ice-bags to lower her temperature, and finally draining her blood which led to a decrease in blood pressure, eventually causing her heart and breathing to stop.

The starting point was high on Cerro Grande, a 10,200-foot (3110-m) summit on the rim of the Valles Caldera not far north of New Mexico State Road 4, the main highway through Los Alamos County. Like many mountains in the Jemez, Cerro Grande was mainly covered with coniferous forest, composed largely of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, and aspen trees, with a characteristic rincon (meadow) on its southern slopes near the summit. This grassy area also represented the headwaters of Frijoles Creek (Rito de los Frijoles), which flows southeast into Frijoles Canyon and on to the Rio Grande, passing en route the main tourist areas at Bandelier.

But when the time came to leave the girls couldn't bear to be parted with their creation - so dad Nick helped them dismantle it, roll it into his van, and transported it back home. Snowy has now taken pride of place at the end of the family driveway, leaving other residents baffled because there is no snow for miles around. Mother Joanne, 42, said: 'They built a snowman and brought the snowman home by dismantling him and rolling him into their dad’s van. Joy: The girls constructed Snowy on Sunday using planks of wood, gloves, stones, sunglasses a scarf and hardhat, but when it came time for them to leave him behind they couldn't bare to do it. Far from home: Mr Reynolds helped the girls to carefully dismantle the snowman, roll it into the back of his van, and then drove it an hour home before reassembling it at the end of their drive. Freezing: While there has been no snow in Poppleton, the sub-zero temperatures of recent days have meant the snowman lives on, much to the bemusement of passers-by. 'We could not believe the response. People have been coming taking photographs. People have been going out of their way to see it.' Mr Reynolds, who helps to run a landscaping business with his wife, had promised his daughters they would go sledging once the snow came. But when the wet weather didn't make it to them, he said he would take them to the snow instead, and they drove off in search of some on Sunday. Job well done: Mrs Reynolds said that Snowy has brought joy to the village of Poppleton, with people diverting from miles around to come and see him and take pictures. Standing out: Residents have been left scratching their heads by the snowman which has appeared in the centre of Poppleton despite there being no snow for miles around. Since bringing him back to his new home on their front lawn, passers-by have been scratching their heads wondering where he came from. Mrs Reynolds added: 'One woman asked if it was real snow. We have just had comments galore. It’s just brought a lot of joy to Poppleton.' She added: 'There are lots of school children that go past and they just stop and stare.'

The user wants me to explain this situation in more detail. My goal will be to provide an accurate and understandable explanation that builds on the information that the user has already provided. Here's the step I'm going to take: 1) I'll pick up where the user left off, where the spacecraft needs to perform a braking maneuver which involves shedding some of its kinetic energy. 2) I will connect this to the previous reference about 'shell strength,' and discuss how it might relate to their ability to handle the forces involved in such a maneuver. 3) I will draw from physics and potentially aeronautics knowledge to provide a clear and accurate explanation, keeping the language relatively layman-friendly so as to keep it accessible. 4) Finally, I will suggest potential solutions based on the given scenario, emphasizing the necessity of the right 'shell strength'. Here's the continuation: \\"Kinetic energy, for the purpose of this explanation, can be thought of as 'motion energy', the more a spacecraft has, the faster it goes. By conducting a braking maneuver, we'd essentially want to decrease this kinetic energy, slowing down the spacecraft.  But this brings us to the issue of 'shell strength'. You see, any braking maneuver will subject the spacecraft to numerous forces like friction and stress on its structure, both internal and external, from the sudden change in momentum. If the shell of the spacecraft isn't strong enough to handle these forces, it could cause substantial damage and personal risk to the pilots. Therefore, having sufficient shell strength is critical to safely perform such maneuvers. Without it, even if our pilots were willing, we'd potentially be asking them to risk more than we'd have a right to ask. For future designs, we must look for materials that can increase the shell strength to make such manoeuvres possible and safe\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(2) For scalar fluctuations , Formula 9 is referred to as the scalar spectral index , with the formula 10 corresponding to scalar invariant fluctuations . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially mean the same thing. Both sentences discuss two specific formulas (formula 9 and formula 10) related to scalar fluctuations. However, there are slight differences in the way the information is presented, which can cause mild confusion. In both sentences, formula 9 is referred to as the 'scalar spectral index.' This term is consistent and implies that formula 9 is used to describe the behavior of scalar fluctuations, such as their amplitude and scale dependence. The difference between the two sentences lies in the description of formula 10. In the first sentence, formula 10 is defined as corresponding to 'scale invariant fluctuations.' On the other hand, the second sentence mentions formula 10 as corresponding to 'scalar invariant fluctuations.' From the context, we can deduce that both sentences are trying to convey the same idea. Formula 10 likely deals with scalar fluctuations that are invariant or constant across different scales. However, the first sentence (with 'scale invariant fluctuations') focuses more on the invariance across scales, whereas the second sentence (with 'scalar invariant fluctuations') emphasizes the fact that these are scalar fluctuations. But fundamentally, they are referring to the same concept. In summary, yes, both sentences mean the same thing, with only slight variations in the wording. Both sentences convey the idea that formula 9 is the scalar spectral index and that formula 10 corresponds to fluctuations that are invariant across different scales (specifically for scalar fluctuations)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Almost two centuries before Columbus, Ibn Battuta set off for Mecca, returning home three decades later as one of history's great travelers. Driven by curiosity, he journeyed to remote comers of the Islamic world, traveling through 44 modern countries, three times as far as Marco Polo. Little celebrated in the West, his name is well known among Arabs. In his hometown of Tangier, a square, a hotel, a cafe, a ferry boat, and even a hamburger are named after him. Ibn Battuta stayed in Mecca as a student for several years, but the urge to travel soon took over. In one adventure, he traveled to India seeking profitable employment with the sultan of Delhi.On the way, he described his group being attacked in the open country by 80 men on foot, and two horsemen. \\"We fought... killing one of their horsemen and about twelve of the foot soldiers...

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What were the first names of the three members that came from Rage Against the Machine? is inside the article: Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band, as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell, cemented the supergroup's permanent demise.

Please answer the following question: -  Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process after the turbine spins is the conversion of the mechanical energy produced by the spinning turbine into electrical energy through the use of an electric generator and distributing it to the power grid. In more detail, the spinning turbine is connected to a shaft, which is connected to the rotor of an electric generator. The rotor is composed of tightly wound coils of wire and, when rotated, generates a magnetic field. This field interacts with the magnetic fields produced by the stator, an array of stationary wire coils located around the rotor. As the rotor spins, the changing magnetic fields induce an electric current in the stator coils through a process called electromagnetic induction. The electric current generated in the stator coils is alternating current (AC), as the magnetic fields periodically change direction due to the rotation of the rotor. This AC power generated by the electric generator is then stepped up to a higher voltage using a transformer, which makes it more efficient for transportation over long distances. Finally, the transformed electrical energy is fed into the power grid for distribution to various consumers, such as residential areas, commercial establishments, and industrial facilities. The power grid network connects power plants to the end-users, ensuring a continuous supply of electricity to meet the demands of society. To maintain the balance between power generation and consumption, grid operators continuously monitor the electricity flow and adjust the power generation from various sources accordingly."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Instructions: Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage. Input: A rock under enough stress will fracture. There may or may not be movement along the fracture. If there is no movement on either side of a fracture, the fracture is called a joint. The rocks below show horizontal and vertical jointing. These joints formed when the confining stress was removed from the rocks as shown in (Figure If the blocks of rock on one or both sides of a fracture move, the fracture is called a fault (Figure 1.2). Stresses along faults cause rocks to break and move suddenly. The energy released is an earthquake. How do you know theres a fault in this rock? Try to line up the same type of rock on either side of the lines that cut across them. One side moved relative to the other side, so you know the lines are a fault. Slip is the distance rocks move along a fault. Slip can be up or down the fault plane. Slip is relative, because there is usually no way to know whether both sides moved or only one. Faults lie at an angle to the horizontal surface of the Earth. That angle is called the faults dip. The dip defines which of two basic types a fault is. If the faults dip is inclined relative to the horizontal, the fault is a dip-slip fault (Figure 1.3). There are two types of dip-slip faults. In a normal fault, the hanging wall drops down relative to the footwall. In a reverse fault, the footwall drops down relative to the hanging wall. This diagram illustrates the two types of dip-slip faults: normal faults and reverse faults. Imagine miners extracting a re- source along a fault. The hanging wall is where miners would have hung their lanterns. The footwall is where they would have walked. A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault in which the fault plane angle is nearly horizontal. Rocks can slip many miles along thrust faults (Figure 1.4). At Chief Mountain in Montana, the upper rocks at the Lewis Overthrust are more than 1 billion years older than the lower rocks. How could this happen? Normal faults can be huge. They are responsible for uplifting mountain ranges in regions experiencing tensional stress. A strike-slip fault is a dip-slip fault in which the dip of the fault plane is vertical. Strike-slip faults result from shear stresses. Imagine placing one foot on either side of a strike-slip fault. One block moves toward you. If that block moves toward your right foot, the fault is a right-lateral strike-slip fault; if that block moves toward your left foot, the fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault (Figure 1.5). Californias San Andreas Fault is the worlds most famous strike-slip fault. It is a right-lateral strike slip fault (See opening image).

Q:-  A bird picks a spot high spot, often in a tree - The bird collects bits of sticks and grass - The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches - Leaves, mud and spider webs are added to the sticks - The mud, leaves and webs glue the sticks together  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process for a bird building its nest would likely involve creating a comfortable and secure inner lining for the nest. This is an essential part of nest construction, as it provides insulation and a cozy environment for the bird and its future offspring. Here's a detailed description of the final stage: 1. Selecting appropriate materials: The bird would search for soft and insulating materials to line the interior of the nest. Such materials may include feathers, animal fur, moss, lichen, fine grasses, and plant down. Some birds, like hummingbirds, are known to use cotton, tree bark, or even small strips of paper they find in the environment. 2. Transporting the materials: Once the bird has collected sufficient materials for the inner lining, it would carry them to the nest location, either in its beak or wedged between its body and wings, depending on the size of the materials. 3. Arranging and weaving the materials: Upon reaching the nest, the bird would carefully arrange the soft materials in the interior of the nest. It may use its beak and feet to weave and tuck the materials into place, forming a snug and well-insulated cup-like structure. The bird would also ensure the materials are tightly secured so that they do not get dislodged by strong winds or movement within the nest. 4. Customizing the nest to fit the bird and its species' needs: Different bird species require specific nest dimensions and features. For example, some birds, like owls, may require a deeper cup to safely hold their eggs, while others, like doves, would benefit from a flatter construction. The bird would add or remove materials as needed to create the perfect living space for its species and size. 5. Final adjustments and readiness for use: Once the interior lining is firmly in place, the bird may make any last-minute adjustments to ensure the nest is stable, comfortable, and suitable for laying eggs. Some birds may test the nest by sitting inside it and making additional modifications if required. In conclusion, the last step of the nest-building process would involve the bird lining the interior of the nest with soft, insulating materials to create a comfortable and well-insulated space for itself and its future offspring. This stage is crucial for the bird's nesting success, as it ensures optimum conditions for the survival and development of its eggs and chicks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which European country has the oldest Parliament???","output":"The European country with the oldest Parliament is Iceland, which has a legislative assembly known as the Althing (Alþingi in Icelandic). Established in the year 930 AD, it is considered one of the oldest, continuously functioning parliaments in the world. The Althing was initially established as an outdoor assembly at a place called Þingvellir, which lies approximately 45 kilometers east of the modern capital, Reykjavík. This location was chosen because of its availability of natural resources and its position in the heart of the Icelandic territory. The assembly gathered annually and acted as a forum for both political and legal affairs, enabling chieftains and high-ranking figures to discuss and arbitrate on matters concerning the Icelandic Commonwealth. During the early days, Althing functioned as a legislative, executive, and judiciary body, but it did not have a formally structured administrative system. The country's laws were orally preserved and recited by the Lawspeaker (lögsögumaður), who also played the role of a mediator between disputing parties. The Althing underwent significant changes over the centuries. In 1262, Iceland entered into a union with the Kingdom of Norway, later becoming a part of the Kalmar Union under the Danish Crown in 1380. This caused a reduction in the Althing’s political influence. However, it still maintained its role as a judiciary body. In 1800, due to the order of the Danish King, the Althing was disbanded, and its administrative functions were transferred to Reykjavík. However, the desire for a national assembly never vanished. Icelandic nationalists sought to restore the Althing, and they finally succeeded in 1843 when the Danish King allowed the establishment of a consultative body. Eventually, internal and external pressures led to the Danish-Icelandic Act of Union in 1918, granting Iceland its autonomy and sovereignty while remaining under the Danish Crown. On June 17, 1944, following a public referendum, Iceland finally declared itself a fully independent republic, and the Althing became the national parliament in its modern form. Today, the Althing consists of 63 members who are elected every four years to represent the Icelandic population. The Althing now functions as a modern parliamentary democracy with a clear separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In summary, Iceland boasts the oldest Parliament in Europe in the form of its national legislative assembly, the Althing. Established in 930 AD, it has faced numerous changes throughout history, but it remains a symbol of Icelandic national identity and an essential element of their democratic system."},{"instruction":"Question: Who terminates the lizard in a fiery explosion?

Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel.

A key feature of the vehicles was a unique design of epicyclic gearbox in the rear axle . Chambers Motors employed around 75 people and built approximately 500 vehicles in 25 years of operation .  - A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. Depending on the type of van it can be bigger or smaller than a truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, minivans, are commonly used for transporting people from a family. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.

In response to ongoing conflicts and security challenges in the Balkans, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has deployed an international peacekeeping force, known as the Kosovo Force (KFOR). KFOR has been present in the region since June 1999, following the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. The primary objective of this mission is to provide a secure environment and maintain public order in Kosovo, ensuring the protection of all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic background. KFOR is composed of troops from various NATO member and partner countries, with the United States, Germany, Italy, and Turkey being the largest contributors. The overall force is organized into multinational task forces, with each task force responsible for a specific sector of Kosovo. KFOR's responsibilities also include monitoring and verification duties in the region, as well as providing support for humanitarian organizations and local authorities. Over the years, the number of NATO troops stationed in Kosovo has fluctuated based on the evolving security situation and political developments. At its peak, there were close to 50,000 troops involved in the KFOR mission. However, as the security situation improved, the number of troops was gradually reduced. The current strength of KFOR is approximately 16,000 soldiers, although this number is subject to change based on the ongoing situation on the ground.

News article: Marie Henein, Jian Ghomeshi's lawyer, denies she has betrayed women Marie Henein, the lawyer who successfully represented former CBC Radio host Jian Ghomeshi, is rejecting any accusations that she has betrayed women by taking on the high-­profile sexual assault case, insisting that justice was served in the trial. \\"I'm thrilled with the result,\\" said Henein in an exclusive interview with CBC's chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge on The National. \\"Obviously I think it is the correct result. It was a principled result in a case where people were agitating, I think perhaps not being as measured as we would like.\\" Henein spoke publicly for the first time since her client was acquitted by an Ontario Court of Justice judge on four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking to overcome resistance. Henein would not go into the details of the case as it is still within the 30­-day appeals period. Ghomeshi had pleaded not guilty to all the charges, which were related to assaults alleged to have taken place against three women from 2002 to 2003. Ghomeshi's acquittal sparked protests and triggered outrage among many, including women's groups that felt the complainants were the ones put on trial. Much of that outrage was expressed through social media, and public figures including politicians from all levels of government expressed their thoughts. Many upset with the acquittal embedded #IBelieveSurvivors in their tweets. \\"Hashtag I believe is not a legal principle, nor should it ever be,\\" said Henein. \\"On a personal level if somebody wants to express their support [to a complainant], that's their choice,\\" she added. \\"When a politician weighs in, that's a little more concerning to me because you're a person who's engaged and should be more knowledgeable about what you're going on.\\" Ghomeshi chose not to testify during the trial, which is his right. Mansbridge asked Henein how she feels when women say that she has betrayed them. \\"I respect their right to say it. I don't respect their opinion or agree with it,\\" she said. Henein said she doesn't believe the same things are said about male lawyers and that when men have opposing opinions, one isn't accused of betraying his gender. \\"You're viewed as people who disagree,\\" she said. Henein said to characterize her role in such a way that implies she is against women is \\"a fundamental misconception of what we do in the justice system.\\" \\"I mean female judges adjudicate all sorts of cases, including sexual assault cases. They are not traitors to the gender when they acquit and they're not supporters of the gender when they convict. They're doing their job. As am I.\\" She told Mansbridge she took the case despite its high ­profile nature, not because of it. \\"This one is like any other one. There's nothing unusual about it for me. It would be one of many cases in this office of this nature,\\" she said. The high­ profile aspect of the case \\"would influence it for me not to take it,\\" she said. Many critics believed the judge's ruling revealed a significant flaw in the legal system involving sexual assault cases. Mansbridge said some argue the system isn't fair, since the accused is under no obligation to testify, meaning the defendant's credibility doesn't face the same scrutiny as the complainants. But Henein said the defendant's right not to take the witness box is integral to the presumption of innocence in requiring the state to prove its case. \\"The legal system is premised on our fundamental belief that if you are going to a accuse me of a crime you will have to prove it, \\" she said. Henein said a sexual assault case shouldn't be treated any differently than any other crime \\"in the sense that the presumption of innocence is set aside or reasonable doubt is thrown out the window.\\" Henein cited other sexual assault cases that have resulted in wrongful convictions. \\"That doesn't mean that everybody is lying. It means that we know as a matter of human nature, some people tell the truth, some people don't,\\" Henein said. \\"I think justice was served. I think it is pretty significant that in one of the highest profile cases, in one of the cases where everybody had an opinion ... that you knew, that you could walk into court and that there would be an impartial person that would decide on the evidence that is heard.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about a lawyer named Marie Henein, who defended a man named Jian Ghomeshi in a high-profile sexual assault case.

Options: - new york - state park - underwater - dead body - michigan Answer:","output":"Billy lived alone by a lake, enjoying the serenity and peacefulness of his surroundings. However, he was informed that he had to move because people weren't allowed to live in that specific area. Based on the given options, the most suitable choice for the restricted location would be a state park. State parks are protected areas managed by the government and are created for the purpose of preserving the natural beauty, cultural heritage, wildlife, and providing recreational opportunities to the public. They serve as important sources of income for the government through tourism, as well as functioning as ecological or environmental reserves, ensuring the health and sustainability of ecosystems. When people like Billy choose to live in state parks, it can lead to several issues. First and foremost, it compromises the objectives of these parks in preserving the natural surroundings. The presence of people can negatively impact the pristine habitat, leading to pollution, deforestation, and disturbance of wildlife. Secondly, unauthorized human settlements can exacerbate the already considerable challenge of managing these parks. Park rangers and other staff members must continuously monitor the entire area and discourage any unauthorized activities. By living in a state park, Billy would be jeopardizing the conservation efforts that the park was meant to champion. Alternatively, living in a state park would present various challenges to Billy. Access to essential services such as electricity, clean water, and healthcare may be limited or nonexistent. Additionally, state parks generally have restricted hours of operation, making it difficult for Billy to maintain social connections or earn a livelihood. In contrast, the other options provided—New York, underwater, a dead body, and Michigan—do not seem to match the context of why someone couldn't live in a specific location. While there might be varying degrees of viability associated with each option, none of these areas embody the same rationale as to why living there would be strictly forbidden. In conclusion, a state park is the most suitable choice to answer the question due to the crucial role state parks play in environmental conservation and the direct conflicts that arise when people attempt to live within their boundaries. Evacuating residents like Billy from state parks allows these valuable areas to continue serving their purpose in protecting natural and cultural resources, and providing safe, enjoyable recreational spaces for visitors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans, who fervently pound the podium against the deficit, didn't blink Friday at passing a whopping 287 billion business tax cut measure with no effort to pay for or offset that amount. GOP lawmakers argued the bill helps the economy, but budget-watching organizations outside Congress proclaimed it an irresponsible move. The 258-160 vote marked one of the largest unpaid-for measures passed by the House in years, but was also the latest sign that tax cuts are at the center of the Republican universe and the ballyhooed deficit fight is not on the same level as a priority. \\"I want to say how appalling it is for OPTIONS: - Boehner to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - CNN to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - Congress to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - GOP to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - House to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - House Republicans to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - Republican to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - Senate to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" - Washington to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\"","output":"\\"I want to say how appalling it is for House Republicans to come forward and say 'let's (push 287 billion) unpaid for.'\\" This sentence fits the context of the paragraph, as it directly addresses the actions of House Republicans in passing the 287 billion business tax cut measure without any efforts to offset the cost.

The adventurous senator took a vacation from Capitol Hill and went on a fourday Robinson Crusoe style holiday with his two teenage sons to a remote, deserted island in the North Pacific Ocean. The senator and his sons, 15yearold Tanner and 13yearold Dallin, traveled 5,200 miles from Phoenix, Arizona to the island of Biggarenn. They didn't carry any food or water. The island is part of the Marshall Islands. It offered no basic supplies, so the Flakes had to catch and cook their own food and purify their water. Their diet was made up of coconuts, crabs and fish. They caught the crab and fish themselves and cooked the food over an open fire started with a magnifying glass  . The Flakes brought along a lobster trap   in the hope of having some delicious treats, but lost it within the first few hours after it was attacked by a shark. They also carried two pumps to remove salt from ocean water. It took them hours each night to pump for just a few gallons of fresh water. One of the most memorable moments of the trip, the father said, was when he and his 15yearold son were almost caught by sharks after spearing   a fish in the ocean. Still, it was quite an enjoyable holiday for them. \\"For a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no disturbance, no texting,\\" Flake recalled.

Answer the following question: Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.

Are \\"it\\" and \\"The sculpture\\" the same?","output":"To determine if \\"it\\" and \\"The sculpture\\" are the same in this sentence, let's analyze the sentence step-by-step: 1. Read the sentence and identify the subject and object: In this sentence, \\"The sculpture\\" is the subject, and \\"the shelf\\" is the object affected by the action of the sculpture. 2. Look for pronouns and their antecedents: The pronoun \\"it\\" is used in the sentence. The antecedent is the word or phrase that the pronoun refers to. In this case, \\"it\\" likely refers to a noun mentioned earlier in the sentence. 3. Establish the connection between the pronoun and its antecedent based on context: In this case, \\"it\\" appears after the mention of \\"The sculpture\\" and is part of an explanation for why the sculpture rolled off the shelf (because it wasn't anchored). In the context of the sentence, it makes logical sense that \\"it\\" refers to \\"The sculpture.\\" Based on this analysis, we can conclude that \\"it\\" and \\"The sculpture\\" are the same thing in this sentence, as \\"it\\" refers to \\"The sculpture\\" as its antecedent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair. And he was doing just fine until it was time to go to his second shift at 1-0 Computer Associates, where he had been working on a program for the management of empty space in staff lockers in telecommunications companies. Question: Christopher probably lived this way for === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"It is impossible to determine the exact duration that Christopher Warm lived this way for, as the story does not provide that information. However, one can infer that Christopher likely lived this way for a significant amount of time, given his sedentary lifestyle and apparently successful efforts at managing his physical fusion with the chair. In both his professional and personal life, Christopher seemed to have found ways to adjust and cope with his peculiar situation. At work, he was still able to perform his job as a software specialist effectively, even with the physical limitation of being fused to a chair. This suggests that his colleagues and superiors were content with his performance and may not have seen a pressing need to resolve or address his condition, as long as he continued to do his job.  Furthermore, the incident of fusion appears to have become a normalized part of conversations and interactions at work, with people discussing it during cigarette breaks and perhaps even incorporating it into their perception of Christopher as \\"Office Desk\\". Similarly, Christopher may have adapted to his new reality by pretending to ignore the fusion and focusing on his tasks at hand, which would have allowed him to maintain some semblance of normalcy and productivity. Outside of work, the story states that Christopher spent most of his time behind a desk as well, which implies that he generally led a sedentary lifestyle and did not participate in many activities that would have required movement or physical exertion. It is likely that this lifestyle further enabled Christopher's fusion with the chair to persist, as he may not have experienced significant challenges that urged him to seek a solution or change his circumstances. In conclusion, while the story does not explicitly state how long Christopher lived this way, it is evident that his sedentary lifestyle and adaptive measures enabled him to continue with his daily life for an extended period. The fact that he was able to balance two separate jobs, work on various computer programs, and maintain a sense of normalcy suggests that he may have lived this way for quite a long time, even if it was not an ideal situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While multi-millionaire Tom Mullen and his wife Kate attend a science fair, their son Sean is kidnapped. Sean is taken to an apartment by Maris, a caterer for the Mullens, along with criminals Clark, Cubby and Miles, and Detective Jimmy Shaker, Maris's boyfriend and the mastermind behind the kidnapping. Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding 2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping.Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the ransom. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby. He dies before he can reveal Sean's location. Shaker later arranges another drop off. While Tom initially agrees to take the money alone, he realizes there is no guarantee Sean will be returned alive and instead appears on television to offer the ransom as a bounty on the kidnappers' heads, promising to withdraw the bounty and drop all charges if the kidnappers return his son alive and unharmed.Despite the pleadings of Kate and FBI Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Tom sticks to his plan, believing it is the best chance of having Sean returned. Shaker lures Kate to a meeting where he tells her to pay the ransom or Sean will die. Tom responds by increasing the bounty to 4,000,000. Shaker calls Tom and demands to be paid, but Tom still refuses, and Shaker fires a gunshot after Tom hears Sean scream for help, leading Tom and Kate to believe their son is dead. Clark and Miles attempt to abandon the plan and flee, but Shaker calls in the NYPD to request backup and kills both of his men while making it look like Miles shot first, and kills Maris after she shoots him in the arm from behind. The NYPD arrive and find Shaker with Sean, believing Shaker found and rescued the boy. Hawkins informs Tom and Kate and they are reunited with their son while Shaker is hospitalized. Tom also recognizes Maris.Shaker later pays Tom a visit to claim the reward and leave the country before investigators discover his connection with Maris. Tom and Sean, however, recognize Shaker as the kidnapper, and Shaker realizes this. Though his initial plan is to kill everyone in the apartment, Tom persuades him to accompany him to the bank to gain the money and leave peacefully. On the way, however, Tom discreetly alerts Hawkins and the police and FBI converge on Tom and Shaker outside the bank. A chase ensues in which Tom and Shaker grapple furiously before falling through a shop window, severely injuring both and impaling Shaker through the neck.

Solve 0 = 4*g - 52 + 48 for g.","output":"To solve the given equation for 'g', you need to isolate 'g' on one side of the equation. Let's go through this step-by-step. The original equation is: 0 = 4*g - 52 + 48 First, deal with the constants (the numbers without variables attached) by summing them up. In this case, -52 and +48 are like terms and can be summed. 0 = 4*g + (-52 + 48) The result is: 0 = 4*g - 4 The next step is to isolate 'g' on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to get rid of the '-4' attached to '4*g'. This can be done by adding 4 to both sides of the equation. Remember, the additive inverse (opposite) of any number \\"n\\" is \\"-n\\", meaning that adding n and -n gives 0. So, when we add 4 to the left side of the equation, it 'cancels out' the -4 on the right side: 0 + 4 = 4*g - 4 + 4 This simplifies to: 4 = 4*g Finally, to completely isolate 'g', divide every term in the equation by 4, which is the coefficient on 'g'. Remember that any non-zero number divided by itself is 1. Hence, when you divide 4*g by 4, you get 'g': 4/4 = (4*g)/4 This simplifies to: 1 = g So, the solution to the equation 0 = 4*g - 52 + 48 is g = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Given the two facts above, a flashlight performs the function of converting one form of energy into another, specifically chemical energy into light energy, through the process of work.  The flashlight functions in the following manner: The chemical energy is stored in the batteries as potential energy. When the flashlight is switched on, a closed circuit is formed, and the stored chemical energy in the batteries starts to transform into electrical energy. The electrical energy then flows through the flashlight, reaching the bulb or the LED (light-emitting diode) inside the flashlight.  At this point, the bulb or the LED converts electrical energy into light energy, which is then emitted as visible light. This entire process is a series of energy conversions, where chemical energy is converted into electrical energy and then into light energy.

In the town of Red Rock, gun salesman Steve Farrell demonstrates the new Colt .45 repeating pistols to the sheriff who is impressed that the United States government just ordered two thousand of these powerful weapons for the army. The demonstration is interrupted when men arrive to transfer one of the prisoners to another jail. As he's being led away, prisoner Jason Brett grabs the pistols, shoots the sheriff, and escapes, pretending that Farrell was his partner. Convinced that Farrell was involved in the escape, the townspeople arrest the innocent gun salesman. In the coming days, Brett initiates a campaign of robberies and cold blooded murder, with regular guns being no match for his Colt .45 pistols. Four months later, Farrell is released from jail due to a lack of evidence. The new sheriff offers him a letter clearing him of the charges if he reveals Brett's whereabouts. Reasserting his innocence, Farrell vows to go after Brett to retrieve his guns.

Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack.

New York (CNN) -- Three defendants pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to conspiring to defraud a Holocaust reparations organization out of 57.3 million, according to court documents. Genrikh Kolontyrskiy, Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher, all of Brooklyn, helped produce and process some of the thousands of fraudulent applications for the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany that are under investigation. The organization, also known as the Claims Conference, distributes more than 400 million a year from funds provided by the German government to victims of the Holocaust. \\"Our efforts to hold to account all of the individuals who participated in defrauding an organization that exists solely for the purpose of aiding victims of Nazi atrocities continues,\\" said Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. The defendants aided in defrauding two funds managed by the Claims Conference, the Article 2 Fund and the Hardship Fund, of 45 million and 12.3 million, respectively, according to court documents. The Article 2 Fund makes monthly payments of around 400 to survivors of Nazi persecution who make less than 16,000 per year \\"and either lived in hiding or under a false identity for at least 18 months,\\" according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's office. The Hardship Fund pays a one-time payment of 3,500 to \\"victims of Nazi persecution who evacuated the cities in which they lived and were forced to become refugees.\\" Kolontyrskiy, 80, knowingly processed fraudulent applications for payment while employed with the Article 2 Fund, according to court documents. Moysey Kucher, 66, and Dora Kucher, 58, recruited individuals to provide identification documents that were used to prepare fraudulent applications for both funds, in exchange for money paid out to the false applicants, according to court documents. Jesse Siegel, Kolontyrskiy's attorney, said his client was by no means a major instigator, but he takes responsibility for his actions.  After reading the above, is \\"The Article 4 Fund and the Work Fund\\" the correct answer to the question \\"When Genrikh Kolontyrskiy, Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher submitted applications fraudulently, what two organizations did their money come from?\\"?

Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Movie title: Vexille Context: By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror â the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine.

The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité, while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The institution placed in the Palais Royal that does not judge constitutionality of laws is the Conseil d'État. It is important to differentiate between the roles and responsibilities of each of the highest courts in France, which are located in Paris, to understand their specific functions. As mentioned in the context, the Court of Cassation is the highest court in the judicial order and reviews criminal and civil cases. It is lodged in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité. Its primary role is to ensure the correct application of law in civil and criminal cases, as well as to unify jurisprudence throughout the French legal system. It does not, however, judge the constitutionality of laws. The Conseil d'État, on the other hand, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. It mainly serves two functions: providing legal advice to the executive branch (i.e., the President and the Government) and acting as the highest court in the administrative order, ruling on cases involving litigation against public bodies. While the Conseil d'État is an essential part of the French legal system and has the authority to review the legality of administrative acts and decisions, it is not responsible for judging the constitutionality of laws. The Constitutional Council has the specific role of determining the constitutionality of laws and government decrees. It is an independent body that ensures the conformity of legislation with the principles and rules enshrined in the French Constitution. The Council also plays a vital role in overseeing the electoral process for parliamentary, presidential, and referenda elections, as well as examining disputes related to these elections. The Constitutional Council convenes in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal, thereby completing the trio of high-level judicial institutions housed in these historic settings. In conclusion, the institution placed in the Palais Royal that does not judge constitutionality of laws is the Conseil d'État, whose main functions are providing legal advice to the executive and acting as the highest court for administrative litigation. The responsibility of assessing the constitutionality of laws lies with the Constitutional Council, which also resides within the Palais Royal complex."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick a simple vase that matches the color of another accessory in your living room, like the throw pillows on your couch. Alternatively, create visual interest by choosing a vase with cutout designs. When set near a lamp, a cutout vase will cast appealing shadows along the top of your side table. Pick a style of glass that appeals to you; both opaque and clear glass work as side table decorations. Color is most important for decorating with glass bottles. Try to pick glass bottles in colors that are not identical, but work well together (like violet, pink, and magenta or teal, mint green, and ocean blue). You can also place flowers or sand inside the bottles for an extra touch. Purchase an item that really catches your eye, whether it be a plant, sculpture, decorative box, lamp, or something similar. Place it in the middle of the side table on its own so it can take center stage. This decorative choice is simple, but will prove effective at drawing the eyes of your guests. Small coffee table books can be set on top of your side tables. Try to pick books with the most appealing designs. Vibrantly designed books make the best choices. Watch out for interesting lettering and color schemes. Try to pick books of different thicknesses as well for further visual interest. If you want to make your decorating a bit more personal, try to pick books that focus on subject matter you enjoy, such as photos of kittens or gorgeous cityscapes. Your theme could be anything that appeals to you or hearken back to a favorite memory. For instance, if you’re a lover of the outdoors, decorate your side table with flowers, plants, and stones. If you recently traveled to an amazing city, place souvenirs (such as a mini Eiffel Tower or tiny Kyoto shrine gates) and travel photos from that city on your side table. While you can use plain jars, decorative glass jars make a stronger impression. Pick jars with gorgeous etchings or your favorite saying scrawled on the sides. If you want, fill your jar with glass beads or your favorite type of candy. Houseplants are a classic decor item and are perfect for side tables. Make a potted plant a standalone centerpiece on your side table, or group it with other items, such as decorative jars and a stack of books. Mini ferns and succulents (like cacti and aloe) are great plants to decorate with; succulents also have the advantage of being easy to care for. If you don’t want to care for a live plant, purchase a fake plant to decorate with. Your flowers can be real or artificial, and of any color or species you like. If you’d prefer real flowers, consider using flowers from your home garden or buy flowers from your grocery store’s florist section, and replace them as they wilt. Alternatively, use dried flowers. You can keep your flowers in a vase or bundle them and lay them across the table. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, attractive decorative vases, glass bottles, eye-catching accessories, coffee table books, personalized themes, decorative glass jars, houseplants, and flowers are excellent options for side table decorations. When choosing these items, consider color, style, and visual interest to create a cohesive and compelling display. Whether selecting a single centerpiece or grouping various elements together, these decorating ideas can be tailored to personal preferences and themes to create an inviting and attractive living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who conspires the suicide attack? Title: Black Sunday Movie plot: Michael Lander is a pilot who flies the Goodyear Blimp over National Football League games to film them for network television. Secretly deranged by years of torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he had a bitter court martial on his return and a failed marriage. He longs to commit suicide and to take with him as many as possible of the cheerful, carefree American civilians he sees from his blimp each weekend. Lander conspires with Dahlia Iyad, an operative from the Palestinian terrorist group Black September, to launch a suicide attack using a bomb composed of plastique and a quarter million steel flechettes, housed on the underside of the gondola of the blimp, which they will detonate over the Miami Orange Bowl during Super Bowl X. Dahlia and Black September, in turn, intend the attack as a wake-up call for the American people, to turn their attention and the world's to the plight of the Palestinians. American and Israeli intelligence, led by Mossad agent David Kabakov and Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Sam Corley, race to prevent the catastrophe. After discovering the recording Dahlia made, meant to be played after the attack, they piece together the path of the explosives into the country, and Dahlia's own movements. The bomb-carrying blimp is chased by police helicopters as it approaches the stadium. Kabakov kills Lander and Iyad, but not before Lander lights the fuse to the blimp's bomb. Kabakov lowers himself from the helicopter to the blimp, hooks it up and hauls it out of the stadium and over the ocean where it blows up.     Goodyear Blimp Spirit of Innovation. 20+ years after the film, Goodyear started using the blue and yellow livery after Black Sunday was made, accounting for the blimp's different appearance in the film.

After the steam is condensed back into water in the condenser, this water is then returned to the boiler to be reheated, converted into steam again, and used to turn the turbine. This cycle repeats as long as the power plant is in operation. In a more detailed explanation, the water is first treated to remove impurities before it is pumped back into the boiler. The pressure is then gradually increased to force the water back into the boiler where heat from the furnace once again turns it into steam. This process is critical in maintaining the efficiency and longevity of the steam cycle in the power plant.  Moreover, this cycle is an example of a Rankine cycle, which describes the process of heat conversion into work. This is a critical principle that underlies the operation of many different power plants, from coal-fired plants to nuclear power stations. The recycling of the water allows, not only the conservation of water, a precious resource, but also the continuous generation of electricity, thus optimizing the production process. Furthermore, it is important to understand that every stage in the power generation process is interconnected, with each stage directly influencing the other. Any interruption or inefficiency in one step can affect the overall operation, therefore, regular maintenance, monitoring, and optimization of all components including the boiler, turbine, generator, and condenser are vital.  In conclusion, the last step in the process, where steam is condensed back into water and then reused in the boiler, is crucial for maintaining an efficient, operational power plant. This step embodies the concept of a circular system, an incredibly important component of power generation, highlighting the importance of water recycling and heat management in generating electricity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Here's a question: The city's community garden was demolished for yet another what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - wasteland - ocean - desert - parking lot - flowers  I believe the correct choice is \\"parking lot\\", here's why: A:","output":"I agree with you that the correct answer is \\"parking lot\\". Here's a step-by-step justification for this choice: 1. Analyze the given context: The city's community garden was demolished. This implies that the area was turned into something else after its demolition.  2. Evaluating the options:   a. Wasteland - This is unlikely, as demolishing a garden would not typically result in an area being converted to a wasteland. Urban development projects usually aim to improve or repurpose an area, not degrade it.   b. Ocean - This is not plausible, as an ocean cannot be created by demolishing a garden in a city.   c. Desert - Similar to the wasteland scenario, converting a garden into a desert would not make sense within an urban development context.   d. Parking lot - This option seems logical, as parking lots are often built in urban areas to accommodate the growing need for parking spaces. Demolishing a community garden to make room for a parking lot may be a practical decision to serve the city's needs.   e. Flowers - This does not make sense, as demolishing a garden for flowers would not require the destruction of the original community garden. 3. Based on the evaluation, the correct choice is \\"parking lot\\". This is because it is the most plausible and logical option, given the context of the question. Development projects in cities often involve repurposing land to meet various needs, and parking lots are a common feature in urban areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In diesem Bericht wird festgestellt, dass die finanziellen Auswirkungen von Unregelmäßigkeiten, die im Jahr 2008 ermittelt wurden, im Vergleich zum Vorjahr um etwa 23,5% gesunken sind. Diese Verbesserung der finanziellen Situation ist auf die Verringerung der Unregelmäßigkeiten in fast allen Ausgabenbereichen, mit Ausnahme der Direktausgaben und Vorbeitrittsmittel, zurückzuführen. Zu den Bereichen, in denen Rückgänge der Unregelmäßigkeiten verzeichnet wurden, gehören insbesondere die Strukturfonds, die Landwirtschaft und die Beitrittsländer. Dies zeigt, dass die Bemühungen der Europäischen Union zur Bekämpfung von Betrug und Unregelmäßigkeiten in den verschiedenen Politikbereichen erfolgreich waren. Trotz dieser positiven Ergebnisse ist es wichtig, weiterhin wachsam zu bleiben und Anstrengungen zur Verbesserung der Kontroll- und Präventionsmaßnahmen fortzusetzen.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The oddly-named Vera-Ellen was to movie dancing what Sonja Henie was to movie ice-skating: blonde, girlish, always delightful to watch, but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material. When I watch Vera-Ellen's sexy apache dance with Gene Kelly in 'Words and Music', I can't help noticing that her blouse (yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes) seems to be made out of the South Vietnam flag. For some reason, the very American Vera-Ellen starred in *two* musicals (made several years apart) set in Edinburgh, a city not noted for its tap-dancers: 'Let's Be Happy' and 'Happy Go Lovely'. In the latter, Cesar Romero plays an American impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in Edinburgh. There's a vague attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival, which is nonsense: the Festival is not a showcase for splashy leg-shows. We also see a couple of stock shots of the Royal Mile: apart from a few Highland accents, there's absolutely no attempt to convey Scottish atmosphere in this movie. The funniest gag occurs at the very beginning, when we learn that the title of Romero's show is 'Frolics to You': this is a cheeky pun that Britons will get and Yanks won't. Vera-Ellen is, as usual, cute and appealing and an impressive dancer, but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad. The plot -- mistaken identity between magnate David Niven and reporter Gordon Jackson -- is brainless, though no more so than the plots of several dozen Hollywood musicals. Romero is less annoying than usual here, probably because (for once) he isn't required to convince us that he's interested in bedding the heroine. The single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of Bobby Howes. The father of Sally Ann Howes was a major star of West End stage musicals; his wistful rendition of \\"She's My Lovely\\" was a big hit in Britain in 1937. Here, he shows up in several scenes as Romero's dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number, nor even any real comedy. It's absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word 'Lovely', sure to evoke Howes's greatest hit -- would cast a major British musical star but give him nothing to do! The delightful character actress Ambrosine Phillpotts (whom I worked with once) shines in one restaurant sequence, and there's a glimpse of the doomed beauty Kay Kendall. As Vera-Ellen's confidante, somebody named Diane Hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard: it sounds like an attempt to imitate Joan Greenwood and Glynis Johns both at the same go, but doesn't match either. Val Guest has a story credit, but this movie doesn't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies. The colour photography is wretched, though I realise that postwar Britain could not afford Hollywood's process work.

Question: How many small spacecraft did the alien mothership deploy? Movie title: Independence Day Movie plot: On July 2, 1996, an enormous alien mothership that has one fourth the mass of the Moon enters orbit around Earth, deploying 36 smaller spacecraft, each 15 miles (24Â km) wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, Levinson, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Whitmore orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the ships activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others, narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the ships are positioned. On July 3, international military leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces attack destroyer ships positioned above the ruins of the cities, but they are protected by force fields. Each destroyer launches a swarm of attack fighters, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with VMFA-314, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to nearby Area 51 where Whitmore's group has landed.

Context_1 : Augustinian nuns are named after Saint Augustine of Hippo (died AD 430) and exist in the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. In the Roman Catholic Church there are both enclosed monastic orders of women living according to a guide to religious life known as the \\"Rule of St Augustine\\", and also other independent Augustinian congregations living in the spirit of this rule (see Augustinian nuns). In the Anglican Communion, there is no single \\"Order of St Augustine\\", but a number of Augustinian congregations of sisters living according to the \\"Rule of St Augustine\\". Context_2 : The term Augustinians, named after Augustine of Hippo (354–430), applies to two distinct types of Catholic religious orders and some Anglican religious orders. Within Anglicanism the Rule of St. Augustine is followed only by women, who form several different communities of Augustinian nuns in the Anglican Communion. Within Roman Catholicism Augustinians may be members of either one of two separate and distinct types of Order: Context_3 : Campsey Priory was a priory of Augustinian nuns located some 1.5 miles (2.5 km) south west of Wickham Market in Suffolk, England. Founded by a charitable bequest shortly after the year 1195, it was in effect confiscated by the crown in 1536. Context_4 : The Church of the Santuccio or chiesa del Santuccio is a small, renaissance-style, Roman Catholic church on via Roma 69 in Siena, Italy, which once was part of the adjacent monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, which was occupied since 1362 by Augustinian nuns. Context_5 : Augustine of Hippo ( or ; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430) was an early North African Christian theologian and philosopher whose writings influenced the development of Western Christianity and Western philosophy. He was the bishop of Hippo Regius in north Africa and is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers in Western Christianity for his writings in the Patristic Era. Among his most important works are \\"The City of God\\" and \\"Confessions.\\" Context_6 : Le Eremite is a small Catholic church in the Dorsoduro area of Venice, Italy. It was built at the end of the 17th century for Augustinian nuns. It formed part of a larger complex which included a convent and schools run by the nuns. The schools ran until the middle of the last century and taught children of all ages - from infants to high school. The church is dedicated to Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Construction was completed in 1694. Context_7 : Asmild Abbey was a house of Augustinian nuns with a close connection to the Augustinian canons at Viborg Cathedral in north central Jutland, Denmark. Context_8 : Burnham Abbey is a house of Anglican nuns near Burnham in Buckinghamshire, England. It was founded as a house of Augustinian nuns, by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. The medieval community consisted of around twenty nuns at the outset, but was never especially wealthy and by the time of its dissolution in 1539 there were only ten. Context_9 : Augustinian nuns are the most ancient and continuous segment of the Roman Catholic Augustinian religious order under the canons of contemporary historical method. The Augustinian nuns, named after Saint Augustine of Hippo (died AD 430), are several Roman Catholic enclosed monastic orders of women living according to a guide to religious life known as the Rule of St. Augustine. Prominent Augustinian nuns include Italian composer Vittoria Aleotti, Italian mystic St. Clare of Montefalco, German mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich and St. Rita of Cascia. Context_10 : Cornworthy Priory was a priory in Devon, England. It was founded in the early thirteenth century, for Augustinian nuns, and existed until 1536. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the lands passed to the Harris family, and remained in the family until the 1640s. fact_1 : The term Augustinians, named after Augustine of Hippo (354–430), applies to two distinct types of Catholic religious orders and some Anglican religious orders. Within Anglicanism the Rule of St. Augustine is followed only by women, who form several different communities of Augustinian nuns in the Anglican Communion. fact_2 : Augustine of Hippo ( or ; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430) was an early North African Christian theologian and philosopher whose writings influenced the development of Western Christianity and Western philosophy.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was not much influenced by new developments in music? ?  The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

Article: China's Jade Rabbit moon rover  has \\" woken up\\" since it entered the lunar night two weeks ago. The moon rover, known as Yutu in Mandarin Chinese, and the Chang'e-3 lander were restarted by the Beijing Aerospace Control Center (BACC), China's Xinhua news agency said. It had been set to sleep for two weeks to ride out extreme climatic conditions and will finally undertake its scientific mission. The Jade Rabbit was \\" put to sleep\\" on 26 December at the onset of the first lunar night of the mission. One night on the moon lasts for around two weeks on Earth and during this time, temperatures fall to -180degC ---conditions too cold for the equipment to function in. There is also no sunlight to power the Jade Rabbit's solar panels. Zhou Jianliang, chief engineer with the BACC, explained: \\" During the lunar night, the lander and the rover were in a power-off condition and the communication with Earth was cut off. \\" When the night ends, they will be started up with the power provided by sunlight and resume operation and communication according to preset programmes. He added that the Jade Rabbit surviving the lunar night showed Chinese technology had proved successful. The Jade Rabbit and the lander compose Chang'e-3 landed on the moon on 14 December. With the landing, China became one of only three nations to soft-land on the moon, and the first to do so in more than three decades. Scientists said the mission was designed to test new technologies and build the country's expertise of space exploration. The Jade Rabbit will gather scientific data and capture images from the Moon. China was planning further missions planned to collect lunar soil samples and it is thought officials are looking to conduct manned lunar landings if they prove successful.

Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held with the most significant terrorism suspects in U.S. custody, has apparently gained extensive knowledge of western pop culture in Guantanamo's Camp 7. An inmate who is imprisoned alongside 'high value' terrorism suspects in the most secretive of Guantanamo Bay camps has somehow learned about Gangnam Style, his lawyer has revealed. Mohammed Rahim al-Afghani, an Afghan man who became the last prisoner sent to Guantanamo after he was accused of helping Osama bin Laden elude capture five years ago, has written a series of letters to lawyer Carlos Warner, revealing a startling knowledge about western culture. Across the letters, he refers to Howard Stern, Fox News and the global video hit of South Korean singer PSY - hardly what you'd expect from a middle-age Afghan who has never been to the U.S. 'Dear Mr. Warner,' he wrote. 'I like. this new song Gangnam Style. I want to do the dance for you but cannot. because of my shackles.' In another letter, the multilingual Rahim. shows some familiarity with American slang. He tells his lawyer, most. likely in jest, that he has adopted a banana rat, a rodent commonly. spotted around the U.S. base in Cuba. 'Tell the guards to leave my. friend alone. They need to chillax.' South Korean rapper Psy has become a global phenomenon with his signature song and dance, 'Gangnam Style' The letters come as a surprise as little has been heard about Rahim since his capture. He was interrogated at an undisclosed location then locked away in Guantanamo's Camp 7, a  prison unit shrouded in secrecy that holds about 15 men who have been designated 'high value' detainees. The letters suggest that the prisoners in Camp 7, a group that includes five charged with aiding and orchestrating the September 11 terror attack, are not completely isolated from the outside world. To Warner, a federal public defender for the Northern District of Ohio, the letters humanize a man who he contends has been demonized by U.S. authorities, who allege he worked as a translator and assistant to bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders. The lawyer says the letters demonstrate a surprising amount of resilience. 'It shows he's different and he's intelligent,' Warner said. 'Just think that he's doing this under all the restrictions that's he's under down there. He has an incredibly good sense of humor.' There have been letters released to the media in the past from other detainees at Guantanamo, often providing valuable information about the prison. Muhammed Rahim al-Afghan said that he cannot do Psy's signature moves because of his shackles. The Justice Department document says Rahim began helping the Taliban in the 1990s and that job morphed into working for al-Qaida. It cites two other prisoners and an undisclosed source identifying Rahim as a close associate of bin Laden. Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 and turned over to the CIA, in whose custody he was subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation. He was transferred to Guantanamo in March 2008. In photos taken by the Red Cross at Camp 7, and obtained by the AP from the prisoner's family in Afghanistan, Rahim has a long flowing beard. In one, he smiles broadly at the camera. It is unclear how the prisoner learned so much of Western pop culture from Cell 7 in Guantanamo, located in Cuba. The first letters from Rahim released by Warner were in June, including one in which he disclosed that Majid Khan, a former Maryland resident who pleaded guilty to aiding al-Qaida, had acquired a cat at Camp 7, which AP reported at the time. The Pentagon and prison officials declined comment and said they could not discuss conditions of confinement for high-value detainees, although they added that prisoners are not permitted to have pets. Rahim al-Afghan was accused of helping the late Osama bin Laden go into hiding; here, bin Laden's house in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The rest of the letters came during or after subsequent visits by Warner, who had them cleared by the military before releasing them to the AP. None are more than a few sentences, and contain many typographical errors, which have been corrected for this story for the sake of clarity. In one, Rahim returns to the theme of his fellow prisoner's alleged cat. 'I want a dog,' he writes. 'I will train my dog to chase Majid Khan's cat.' Osama bin Laden was killed in his home on May 1, 2011. In separate notes, he asks Warner to appeal for help from radio personality Howard Stern. 'If he is the 'King of All Media' he can help me.' In another, he criticizes Fox News' 'Fair and Balanced' slogan, writing that if that were true the channel 'would not have to say it every five minutes.' How he came by this information is not clear. A prison spokesman, Navy Capt. Robert Durand, won't discuss life in Camp 7 but he says that \\"where satellite television and radio is available for detainees,\\" they have access to a wide variety of channels in Arabic, Farsi, English, Russian, Spanish and other languages. The line-up, however, apparently does not include Howard Stern or Fox. With no Internet access, he could have picked up such information from other shows or through Warner, who has spent hours with him and delivered magazines such as Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated and The Economist. The U.S. military will not say when or if Rahim will be charged. His name does not appear on the list of detainees who have been cleared for release from Guantanamo and his name was not among those mentioned as possible candidates for an exchange with the Taliban as part of a peace deal. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article discusses how Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay prisoner held with high-value terrorism suspects, has seemingly gained extensive knowledge of Western pop culture while in Camp 7.

Context: The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.  and the situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.  Answer the following question: In which case the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In case A, the Bt toxin does not need to be digested by the insects. This is because the transgenic crop plants contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it is immediately affected by the active Bt toxin, which binds to its gut wall, causing the insect to stop feeding and eventually die. In contrast, in case B, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state when used as a spray and requires digestion by the insect to become active and have any effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: In late 2000, an American military pathologist orders his Korean assistant to dump 200 bottles of formaldehyde down a drain leading into the Han River. Over the next few years, there are sightings of a strange amphibious creature in the waterway, and the fish in the river die off. A suicidal man, just before jumping into the river, sees something dark moving in the water.In 2006, a slow-witted young man named Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) runs a small snack-bar in a park near the River with his father, Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong). Other family members are Gang-du's daughter, Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung); his sister Nam-joo (Bae Doona), a national medalist archer; and his brother, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), an alcoholic college graduate and former political activist.While Gang-du is delivering food to some customers, a huge creature emerges from the Han River and begins attacking people. Gang-du sees his daughter in the crowd and tries to grab her and run. As he realizes he grabbed on the wrong girl, he sees the creature snatching Hyun-seo and diving back into the river. After a mass funeral for the victims, government representatives and the American military arrive and quarantine people who had contact with the creature, including Gang-du and his family. It is announced that the creature is not only a direct danger, but also the host of a deadly, unknown virus.Gang-du is in a hospital when he receives a phone call from Hyun-seo. She is trapped somewhere in the sewers with the creature. Gang-du tries to explain this to others, but his claims go ignored by all except his family. The four of them escape the hospital. Hee-bong buys a truck, weapons, and a map of the sewers to look for Hyun-seo. They find a snack bar, have a meal and rest. Upon waking up, they encounter the creature. Soon, they discover their gun only serves to anger it, and Hee-bong gets himself killed buying time for his children to escape. Gang-du is captured by the Army. Nam-il and Nam-joo escape but are separated from each other.Two homeless boys, Se-jin and Se-joo, are searching for food when they are attacked and swallowed by the creature. It returns to its sleeping area in the sewer, a large hole, and regurgitates them. Only Se-Joo is alive. Hyun-seo helps Se-Joo hide in a spot the creature cannot reach.Nam-il meets an old friend to trace the location of Hyun-seo's call. He learns that the government has placed a bounty on his family. The friend tries to capture Nam-il, but he manages to escape after obtaining Hyun-seo's general location. He texts the location to Nam-joo and Gang-du. He meets a homeless man (Yoon Je-moon) who knows about the quarantine but decided to stay in the city. After learning of Nam-il's intentions, the man decides to help him. The scientists lobotomize Gang-du to silence him. As he wakes up, he hears the scientists discussing the fact that there is no virus; it is all made up to distract people from the creature's origin. Gang-du escapes by taking one of the nurses hostage and continues searching for his daughter.Back in the sewers, while the creature is sleeping, Hyun-seo makes a rope from old clothes and uses it to get out of the hole. She realizes too late that the creature only feigns sleep to lure her out of her hiding spot. Hyun-seo and Se-joo are swallowed by the creature.The government announces the plan to release a chemical called Agent Yellow into the river and the surrounding area, hoping it will kill the creature. Gang-du finds the creature's sleeping spot but sees no one there. As Gang-du climbs down to the hole, the monster passes over him. He sees Hyun-seo's arm hanging out of its mouth and gives chase, meeting Nam-joo on the way. The creature makes its way to the location where Agent Yellow is released and a large crowd has formed in protest.As the creature attacks the crowd, Agent Yellow is released, which appears to stun the creature. Gang-du pulls Hyun-seo out of its mouth and sees her still clutching Se-joo. The boy is still alive, but Hyun-seo is already dead.As the creature wakes up, Gang-du starts to attack it but is knocked to the ground. Nam-il and the homeless man come to Gang-du's aid. While Nam-il throws Molotov cocktails at the creature, the homeless man pours gasoline onto it. Nam-il accidentally drops his last bottle. Nam-joo picks up the flaming cloth from the bottle with one of her arrows and fires it at the creature, setting it on fire. Before the creature can escape into the water, Gang-du impales it with a metal pole, finally killing it. As Nam-il and Nam-joo hold Hyun-seo, mourning her death, Gang-du picks up Se-joo and takes him to safety.In the final scene, Gang-du has adopted Se-joo. The two live in his food stand, and he still watches over the river.

Jeremy Shu-How Lin, who was born in California, 1988, world-famous now,is the first Chinese-American professional basketball player with the New York Knicks of NBA.  It hasn't been an easy road for Lin. After high school, Lin sent his resume and a DVD of highlights to all the Ivy League schools, and his dream schools Stanford and UCLA. Harvard and Brown were the only schools that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships.  After graduating from Harvard University, Lin went undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft . Lin spent his first season with his hometown the Golden State Warriors. He saw limited minutes with the Warriors, but was cheered in arenas around the country, particularly in cities with large Asian communities, as fans came out in crowds to cheer their homegrown star. In late 2011, Lin spent less than two weeks with the Houston Rockets, moving to the New York Knicks at the very end of the year.  He has made several trips to the NBA's Development League, a minor league for players who show promise but need seasoning before they can compete at the highest level. It appears to have paid off. In February 2012, after keying the Knicks victory over New Jersey, Lin was named the starter for the Utah game, a position he appears to have a hold on in the short term, as Baron Davis, who signed in December to play the position, stays on the disabled list. Lin will likely get stronger the more minutes he plays, and even if Davis returns, spelling the older, recovering player could be productive for Lin: a proven good student who can learn a lot from practicing against a veteran.  Without the services of All-Stars Carmelo and Amare, Lin led New York to a 4-0 record last week. He became the first player in NBA history to record at least 20 points and seven assists in each of his first four starts, which generated a global following known as Linsanity.

Pick the right time to talk to them.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Effective Communication: Anticipate, Identify, and Pick the Right Time Introduction Effective communication is the lifeblood of all interpersonal relationships. It fosters understanding, helps in resolving conflicts, and strengthens connections between individuals. However, engaging in meaningful, productive conversations isn't always easy. In many cases, misunderstandings or insecurities can lead to disagreements, creating a barrier in communication. In this article, we will explore three essential steps in enhancing communication with others: anticipating the outcome, identifying your feelings, and picking the right time to talk. Step 1: Anticipate the Outcome Before initiating any conversation, it's essential to prepare yourself mentally and predict the possible outcomes. Considering the potential repercussions of your words can help you avoid unintentional conflicts and misunderstandings. Actions: 1. Consider the person's perspective: Empathize and understand the person you'll be speaking with, which will result in more effective communication. This will help you build a rapport and mitigate potential negative consequences. 2. Choose your words wisely: Be mindful of the tone, clarity, and selection of your words, ensuring that your point comes across respectfully and effectively. 3. Determine your goals: Reflect on what you hope to achieve from the conversation. Having a clear goal will guide you in tailoring the conversation and maintaining focus on the intended outcome. Step 2: Identify How You Are Feeling Acknowledging and understanding your emotional state is a vital step in effective communication. Emotions can distort our thoughts and heavily influence our behavior, so identifying your emotions will help you control your reactions during the conversation. Actions: 1. Recognize your emotions: Take a moment to pause and truly understand how the situation makes you feel (angry, sad, anxious, etc.). 2. Analyze your emotions: Reflect on why you feel the way you do, and consider if your emotions are linked to any past experiences or underlying assumptions. This will allow you to view the situation more objectively. 3. Manage your emotions: Once you have a clear understanding of your emotions, employ techniques such as deep-breathing or visualization to gather your thoughts and calm your nerves before the conversation. Step 3: Pick the Right Time to Talk Choosing a suitable time to initiate a conversation is crucial in ensuring that the other person is receptive, and the discussion is productive. Picking an inappropriate moment could lead to unnecessary friction or emotional backlash. Actions: 1. Gauge the emotional state of the other person: Ensure that the other individual is in a frame of mind where they can engage in a productive conversation. 2. Consider the environment: Choose a quiet and comfortable setting conducive to a constructive discussion, free from distractions or external stressors. 3. Assess timing: Make sure that both you and the other party have an adequate amount of time to engage fully in the conversation, as rushing through can lead to miscommunication or unresolved issues. Conclusion By implementing the steps of anticipating the outcome, identifying your feelings, and picking the right time, you can significantly improve your communication skills and enhance your relationships, both personal and professional. Practicing these techniques will lead to more profound, more rewarding connections with others, fostering understanding, empathy, and mutual respect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You should approach this conversation almost like you are preparing to give an important speech. You want to write out how you want the conversation to go. Visualize it going well. Practice saying all your reasons out loud to yourself in the mirror or to a friend. You want to get your parent's full attention as you convince them to help you in switching schools.  Say something like, “Hey, Mom and Dad! Can we all sit down at the table together? I have something I’d like to talk about with you, and I’d really love to hear what you think.” You want to let your parents know that this is important to you and that you appreciate them listening to your thoughts. Even if your parents don’t respond at first, you don’t want to come across as whiney because this will make it less likely that your parents will support you in switching schools. At the same time, be honest.  You want them to know how much staying in your current situation will hurt you. Make your statements sincere and to-the-point.   If you’re being bullied, don’t be too embarrassed to show them how much it’s affecting your performance at school and how much it hurts you. Say something like, “There is a group of kids in my class that writes mean notes to me every day and steal things out of my desk. They call me names, and it makes me sad. I’ve asked them to stop, and I’ve talked to the teacher, but they still do it behind her back. I have a hard time enjoying school or focusing because I can’t stop thinking about it.” If you think you need a school with more academic attention say something like, “I’ve been having a hard time finishing my work in school because I don’t understand it. There are so many kids in my class that the teacher usually doesn’t have time to help me.” Or, if you want more of a challenge, say, “I get all A’s at school because the work is too easy. I finish all my work first, and I end up just sitting there in class. My teacher doesn’t have time to make special assignments for me.” These are the reasons that changing would improve your overall life. Some examples of positive reasons to practice might be:  “I’m really interested in learning to play music. Jackson Middle School has the best band program in the state, and it’s only ten minutes away. I’d really get to work on my skills there.” “St. John’s School only has 10 students in each class. If I went there, I’d be able to get more help with my work, and my grades would get better.” “Central Middle School has a lot of science and math classes I could take. They even have a Physics class. I want to be an engineer one day, and it’s never too early to start learning.” You don’t want your parents to have to decide right then whether you can change. That pressure will make them more likely to say “no” out of convenience. End the conversation with a statement like: “Thanks for listening to me. Take some time to think about what I said, and let me know what you think. I really hope you’ll think about letting me change schools” Summary:","output":"The article provides guidance on how to have a thoughtful and persuasive conversation with parents about considering switching schools, emphasizing the importance of preparation, honest communication, and providing valid reasons for the change."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Set your oven to convection and make some room on the center rack. Let it begin warming up as you assemble the nachos. A lower cooking temperature will allow everything to heat evenly throughout without burning the chips. Melted cheese and other temperamental ingredients can stick and harden on an ungreased cooking surface if you're not careful. A quick spritz of cooking spray will prevent that from happening, even with the cheesiest nachos.  Nonstick cookware can be cleaned with a simple wipe, saving you a lot of messy cleanup. Choose a deep pan or casserole dish that will contain all the ingredients you'll be heaping onto your nachos. Distribute the chips out to the edges of the dish. Make sure they're lying as flat as possible. This way, they'll be able to hold toppings better and won't be as likely to break.  Use a hearty style of tortilla chip that will hold up to heavier toppings.  Try to overlap the edges of the chips so there are no open spaces between them. Distribute the cheese evenly over the top of the tortilla chips. Use as much as you please—for smaller portions, a couple handfuls should be enough, while you may need to use an entire package for party-sized platters.  Freshly grated cheese tends to melt better than bagged shredded varieties.  Put down two layers of chips and cheese to achieve just the right ratio of crunch to creaminess. With your first layer complete, you can now pile on any and all of your other favorite nacho toppers. Fresh tomatoes, diced red onion, black olives, refried beans, jalapeño peppers, corn and black beans are all popular options. Once again, aim for even coverage with your ingredients.  Sprinkle a little more cheese on top to help tie it all together. Get creative with your nacho toppings. Try bacon-bleu cheese nachos with sliced scallions, or serve them fajita style with caramelized bell peppers and onions.","output":"First, warm up your oven and make space on the middle rack. Use a low temperature to heat the nachos evenly without burning the chips. Spray the cooking surface with cooking spray so the cheese won't stick. Use a big dish to hold all the nacho ingredients. Lay the chips flat and use strong chips so they don't break. Add cheese on top of the chips; freshly grated cheese melts better. Make two layers of chips and cheese for a nice balance. Add other toppings like tomatoes, onions, and beans, spreading them evenly.

Here is an article: Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez announced that no charges will be filed against Officer Hernandez in connection with the Oct. 2014 shooting death of Ronald Johnson. The attorney's office also showed dashboard camera footage from the incident. (Reuters) Prosecutors in Chicago will not file criminal charges against a police officer who shot and killed a black man last year, an incident that occurred a week before a different fatal shooting that brought national scrutiny to Chicago’s police force, officials said Monday. The decision was announced by Anita Alvarez, the state’s attorney for Cook County, Ill., and came on the heels of the Justice Department announcing plans for a broad civil-rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department. Alvarez held a lengthy news conference Monday to announce the decision, going over details of the investigation, what police and witnesses said and playing a dashboard camera video that captured a portion of the incident. George Hernandez, a Chicago police officer, shot and killed Ronald Johnson III in October 2014, the week before a different officer shot and killed Laquan McDonald, a black 17-year-old. The fatal shooting of McDonald was captured in a graphic dashboard camera video that was released last month, drawing attention to Chicago at a time of intense national focus on how police officers use deadly force. [Why the Justice Department is investigating the Chicago police] Johnson had left a party with three other people when someone opened fire on their car, so they eventually parked and got out of the car, Alvarez said. No one was hurt, but the bullets shattered the rear windshield and damaged the car. These officers saw that Johnson was carrying a gun and ordered him to drop the weapon, but he instead ran away while holding the gun, Alvarez said. He encountered other officers and, prosecutors say, there was a physical struggle between Johnson and an officer who wound up knocked to the ground while Johnson ran away. Hernandez was with two other officers getting out of an unmarked police car when Johnson ran behind their car. Hernandez fired five shots, striking Johnson twice. “Based upon an objective review of the evidence and the law, we have determined that the prosecution could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the actions of Officer Hernandez were not reasonable and permissible under the laws of the state of Illinois,” she said. On Monday, authorities played video footage of the incident recorded by a police dashboard camera and then replayed it in slow-motion. The video shows Johnson running behind the car and across the street, and just after as he leaves the frame, Hernandez is seen firing his gun. During the news conference, authorities also showed a still image of Johnson that appears to show something in his hand while he was running. Prosecutors say a 9mm pistol was recovered from Johnson’s body. In addition, they played portions of 911 calls from people in that area reporting gunfire, calls that prompted responding to the scene encountered some of the men who were in the car with Johnson at the time, Alvarez said. Attorneys for Johnson’s family have accused the city and the police force of covering up what happened in the shooting, insisting that Johnson was unarmed when he was shot. Alvarez said that “all of the evidence points to the fact” that Johnson had a gun when he was shot, including accounts from other people in the car with him the night he was killed. She also said that prosecutors had to carefully examine the fact that Johnson was shot in the back. Even though he was fleeing, she said he was running toward a public park and could have fired as he ran or stopped, turned and open fire. Police officers have considerable leeway when it comes to using lethal force. In 1985, the Supreme Court ruled in Tennessee v. Garner that while police could not shoot at a fleeing suspect just to prevent their escape, they are allowed to shoot if they believe the person is violent and poses a significant danger. Earlier Monday, the Justice Department said it was launching a broad investigation into the Chicago Police Department to look at the way officers use force and to see if their actions are unconstitutional. That federal probe followed protests and unrest in Chicago over the way authorities handled the shooting of McDonald, a teenager who was holding a knife when an officer fired more than a dozen shots at him last year. The city released video footage of McDonald’s death last month after being ordered to do so by a judge. The same day, Alvarez announced murder charges against Jason Van Dyke, the officer who killed McDonald. [Why did authorities say Laquan McDonald lunged at Chicago police officers?] Less than a week after Van Dyke was charged and the video released, Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) dismissed the head of his police department. He also announced a new task force that would look at ways to improve police accountability. Alvarez said that the dashboard video of Ronald Johnson’s shooting was shown to the FBI, who said they were not going to participate in the investigation. This post has been updated.

Today we're going to talk about a special type of cookware called cast iron cookery. You might have seen your mom or dad using a big, heavy pan while cooking. That's probably a cast iron skillet! They're great for cooking yummy food, but they need some extra love to keep them in good shape. So, let's learn how to take care of these special pans so they can keep making tasty meals for a long, long time! 1. Don't Use Soap or Detergents: When it's time to clean up after dinner, we usually use soap to make our dishes sparkly clean, right? But for cast iron pans, we need to do something different. Soap can take away the pan's special coating, called \\"seasoning,\\" that keeps food from sticking. So, instead of using soap, just use warm water and a sponge or soft cloth to gently clean the pan. 2. Keep the Dishwasher Away: You might have seen a big machine in the kitchen called a dishwasher. It washes dishes all by itself – pretty cool, huh? But, remember not to put your cast iron pan in the dishwasher. The strong soap, hot water, and harsh scrubbing can damage the pan's special coating. So, always clean your cast iron pan by hand to keep it safe and sound. 3. Be Gentle with Scrubbing: Sometimes, food can stick to the pan and be tough to clean off. It might be tempting to use something rough like steel wool to scrub it clean, but that can scratch the pan's surface. Only use steel wool when you really, really need to get something off the pan. Otherwise, try using a soft sponge or a special cast iron pan brush to gently clean it. By following these simple tips, you can help keep your cast iron cookery in great shape for many years. So next time you see your mom or dad using a cast iron pan, you can share these tips with them and show off how much you know about taking care of special dishes!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
