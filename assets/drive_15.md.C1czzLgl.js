The","output":"first thing she did was to research the benefits of granite countertops and the various color options available. She discovered that granite is an extremely durable material that resists scratches, heat, and stains, making it a perfect choice for a high-traffic area like the kitchen. Additionally, granite is bacteria-resistant, which would make cleaning and maintaining the countertops much easier. Excited about the possibilities, Jane began searching for local suppliers that could offer her the best quality granite at a reasonable price. She compared several quotes from different companies and finally settled on one that offered a wide range of colors and finishes for her to choose from. To make sure she made the right decision, Jane also looked at reviews from previous customers and found that the supplier had a solid reputation for quality and craftsmanship. Before proceeding with the installation process, Jane had to carefully measure the dimensions of her kitchen counters to ensure a proper fit. She sketched a layout of her kitchen and noted where the sink, cooktop, and other appliances were located. Jane then discussed her preferences and requirements with the chosen supplier, who sent a technician to her home to take accurate measurements and double-check the layout. With all the measurements in hand, the supplier began cutting and fabricating the granite countertops according to Jane's specifications. During this time, Jane started preparing her kitchen for the installation. She removed all items from the counters, detached the sink and faucets, and cleared out space under the cabinets, making it easier for the installers to work. The entire process took a few days, as the fabricators had to carefully polish the edges of the granite slabs and create cutouts for the undermount sink and cooktop. When the granite countertops were ready, the installers arrived at Jane's home and began the process of removing the existing wood countertops. They carefully detached them from the cabinets and disposed of the old counters according to local regulations. Next, they leveled the cabinets to provide a stable, even surface for the new granite countertops.  Installing the granite countertops required caution and precision, as the slabs were heavy and could potentially break if mishandled. The installers carefully maneuvered the slabs into place, making sure they aligned perfectly with the cabinets and walls. They secured the slabs with a combination of adhesive and brackets, ensuring that the countertops would remain in place for years to come. Once the granite countertops were in place, the installers reinstalled the sink, faucet, and cooktop, sealing the edges and seams between the granite and appliances to prevent water damage and create a watertight seal. After the job was completed, Jane marveled at her kitchen's transformation. The new granite countertops provided a sophisticated and modern look that brightened up the entire space. The diverse patterns and colors in the granite added depth and visual interest, making the countertops the focal point of her kitchen. Taking care of her new granite countertops would require a bit more maintenance than her previous wood counters but, Jane knew that the benefits and beauty of her new granite counters were well worth the effort. Following the supplier's recommendations, she sealed the countertops with a high-quality sealer which would preserve their appearance and protect them from potential stains, and regularly cleaned them with a gentle cleaner designed for natural stone surfaces. As time passed, Jane's investment in high-quality granite countertops continued to reward her with its durability, functionality, and undeniable elegance. Her kitchen was now not only a place for her to prepare delicious meals but also a space that showcased her personal style and refined taste."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity.

Answer the following question: Information:  - An intelligence agency is a government agency responsible for the collection, analysis, and exploitation of information and intelligence in support of law enforcement, national security, military, and foreign policy objectives.  - A civil servant or public servant is a person in the public sector employed for a government department or agency. The extent of civil servants of a state as part of the \\"civil service\\" varies from country to country. In the United Kingdom, for instance, only Crown (national government) employees are referred to as civil servants whereas county or city employees are not.  - A government or state agency, often an appointed commission, is a permanent or semi-permanent organization in the machinery of government that is responsible for the oversight and administration of specific functions, such as an intelligence agency. There is a notable variety of agency types. Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department or ministry, and other types of public body established by government. The functions of an agency are normally executive in character, since different types of organizations (\\"such as commissions\\") are most often constituted in an advisory rolethis distinction is often blurred in practice however.  - The Machinery of Government (sometimes MoG) means the interconnected structures and processes of government, such as the functions and accountability of departments in the executive branch of government. The term is used particularly in the context of changes to established systems of public administration where different elements of machinery are created.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style.

Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\"?

Those behind Morsy's ouster, the message states, wanted a \\"secular, pro-American president to rule Egypt so they can continue with their plotting -- along with the Americans and Zionists -- to divide Egypt, just like what happened in Sudan.\\" The 62-year-old Al-Zawahiri is no stranger to Egypt or its politics. A member of a distinguished Egyptian family, he is a surgeon who with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad tried to overthrow President Anwar Sadat and establish an Islamic state. After Sadat's assassination, al-Zawahiri was arrested and convicted on weapons charges. He met Osama bin Laden in the late 1980s and, in about a decade later, merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's boss asserts himself. The message posted Friday comes three days days after another message purportedly from al-Zawahiri appeared online, although it was believed to be recorded June 5. In that message, the voice purportedly of al-Zawahiri denounced U.S. treatment of hunger-striking detainees at its Guantanamo Bay military prison and pledged to free them. He also urged Muslims -- as he and other al Qaeda leaders have many times before -- to unite and fight. \\"Every Muslim in every spot on Earth must work to defend the blood of Muslims that is being shed by America and its allies, and their sanctities that they are violating, and their villages and homes that they are destroying, and their wealth that they are stealing,\\" he said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about a message from Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al Qaeda. He is not happy that Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy was removed from power. He wants Muslims to work together and prevent Egypt from being divided. The message was posted on the internet, but we cannot be sure if it is really from him. Ayman al-Zawahiri is an important person in Egypt and has been involved in politics for a long time. He has joined forces with other groups like al Qaeda and wants Muslims to unite and fight against people they think are hurting them."},{"instruction":"Mr. White's family decided to repair their house. Mr. White bought the house two and a half years ago. Since his kids were growing up, he and his wife wanted to make some changes to the house. They decided to knock down their living room wall to open up the space. When the wooden walls were moved, they were shocked to find a lizard   stuck in the small space between the walls. The lizard's foot was stuck by a nail   which was knocked into the wall from the other side several months ago. However, they wondered how the lizard had _ so long without moving from that place. The family decided to wait for a while and see how the lizard survived several months without moving. While they were doing other things, they kept an eye on the lizard. The son, Ray, suddenly shouted, \\"Dad, look here!\\" Another lizard appeared, carrying food to the stuck lizard's mouth. That was a real surprise!

Sesli haber: Kosovalı Sırpların ikramiyeleri kesilecek Which language is this?","output":"The language in your text, \\"Sesli haber: Kosovalı Sırpların ikramiyeleri kesilecek,\\" is Turkish. Turkish is a Turkic language spoken mainly in Turkey, Cyprus, and surrounding regions. It's one of the most prominent Turkic languages and is known for its distinctive characteristics like vowel harmony and agglutination. \\"Sesli haber\\" translates to \\"Voice news\\" or \\"Audio news\\" in English, depending on the context. \\"Kosovalı Sırpların ikramiyeleri kesilecek\\" translates to \\"The bonuses of the Serbs of Kosovo will be cut\\". Therefore, it seems like the sentence is a headline or a piece of news item about how the bonuses of Serbian people living in Kosovo are set to be cut. Turkish language is different from most Indo-European languages in that it is agglutinative and possesses a subject-object-verb word order. This means that instead of using prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs that English and other Western languages typically use, Turkish prefers to stick grammatical markers onto the ends or beginnings of words. Moreover, Turkish utilizes vowel harmony which means that the vowels within a word need to be from the same class, enhancing the fluidity and consistency in the language. The Turkish alphabet is Latin-based, devised by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1928 as part of his initiatives to modernize Turkey. While the Turkish language might seem quite complex at first glance, due to its unexpected structure for those familiar with Indo-European languages, its consistency in applying grammatical rules and regular spelling actually make it a very logical language. Once learners understand the central logic revolving around the Turkish language, their fluency improves substantially."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He feels trapped in his career, always dreaming of doing something more meaningful with his life. During his time at the bar, he notices a mysterious man in a dark corner. This man is Samuel Morris, a reclusive writer who just moved to town, struggling to finish his soon-to-be groundbreaking novel. One night, after having a few drinks, Meyers approaches Morris out of curiosity and strikes up a conversation. The two men quickly form an unlikely friendship as they share stories and connect over their mutual love for cinema. Meyers, in particular, is astonished to find out that Morris had a brief but successful career as a screenwriter in the past. Over time, Meyers becomes increasingly intrigued by Morris's unfinished novel, which Morris describes as his magnum opus and the story he's always been destined to tell. However, as time goes on, Meyers notices that Morris is tormented by his past, specifically his estranged relationship with his daughter and the death of his wife. Seeing a chance to help his new friend and escape his mundane life as an accountant, Meyers proposes a challenge: finish the novel in 30 days, and they will pitch it together as a screenplay to a well-known film producer. Morris hesitantly agrees, seeing it as a possible way to reach out to his daughter, whom he knows is now a successful actress. As the 30 days progress, Meyers and Morris become inseparable. They help each other face their deepest fears and regrets, providing emotional support throughout the writing process. Upon finishing the novel, the two head to Hollywood to pitch their screenplay, but the journey is filled with obstacles, from a ruthless rival screenwriter to egotistical producers, and even a dash of dangerous intrigue. In a dramatic conclusion, Meyers and Morris successfully present their screenplay to a renowned film studio. However, it becomes clear that their friendship and growth throughout their journey was far more significant than the potential success of their screenplay. Ultimately, Morris is reunited with his daughter, and Meyers finds renewed purpose in his life, finally escaping the monotony of accounting.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Determine the sentiment: The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - garnering footage from the Chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint, his American counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, the drunken Americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in New Orleans.  The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor. I have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them. I just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact American indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world.

Tone: The tone of the text is mostly serious and somber with a hint of sarcasm. 2. Content: The text describes the exploitation of Chinese workers, the unashamed attitude of business owners, and the impact of American consumerism on these workers. It also mentions a glimmer of hope when some Americans show outrage about the unfair wages and the possibility of workers escaping the harsh conditions. 3. Emotions conveyed: The text shows empathy and concern for the exploited workers, disapproval of the business owners and drunken Americans, and appreciation for the film that sheds light on these issues. Overall, the sentiment of the text can be characterized as a mix of negative and positive emotions. The negative sentiment is mainly directed towards the exploitation of workers and the indifferent attitudes of business owners and consumers, while the positive sentiment emerges from the hope that change is possible and the commendation for the film exposing this issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years. Can we infer the following? Pibul was a young leader.","output":"Yes, we can infer that Pibul was a young leader from the given information. The statement specifies that the coup was led by two young leaders, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang. Both of them were educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, which consequently played a significant role in shaping their political views and leadership. Plaek Phibun Songgram, also known as Pibul, was a Thai military officer and political leader who played a crucial role in the development of modern Thailand. Born in 1897, he pursued higher education in France, where he studied the French language, civil and military law, and military strategy. His exposure to European culture and ideas further influenced his outlook and leadership ambitions. Pibul's co-leader, Pridi Phanomyang, was also a key figure in Thai politics. Born in 1900, Pridi was known for his intellectual prowess, progressive ideas, and interest in Western-style democracy. He studied law in France, where he developed strong connections with fellow Thai students and future political collaborators, including Pibul. Together, Pibul and Pridi played pivotal roles in the Siamese coup of 1932, which effectively ended the absolute monarchy in Thailand and introduced a constitutional monarchy system. Their partnership was marked by contrasting political styles, with Pibul leaning towards militarism and nationalism, while Pridi favored a more democratic and liberal approach to governance. Despite their differences, the two young leaders managed to steer Thailand through a period of intense political change and modernization. Their European education and exposure to Western ideas helped shape the nation's transformation during the 1930s and 1940s, while their youthfulness provided them with the energy and ambition required to challenge traditional power structures and introduce new political concepts. In conclusion, the information provided allows us to infer that Pibul was indeed a young leader during the time of the coup in Thailand, and his leadership, in partnership with Pridi Phanomyang, had a profound impact on the country's political landscape and its transition towards a more modern and progressive nation. Their Western education and shared experiences in Europe played an essential role in shaping their political outlook and the policies they would implement as leaders in Thailand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They both like meteorology. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere.  and a hint : The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with  altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height.  Please answer this question : Which student learned more about temperature inversion? Answer:","output":"Jane learned more about temperature inversion. In the given information, it states that \\"The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion.\\" and \\"This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere\\". Since Jane studies the stratosphere, she would be more familiar with and have a better understanding of the temperature inversion phenomena. Barbara, on the other hand, focuses on the ozone layer formation, which doesn't specifically cover temperature inversion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. a). size b). shape c). color d). ph level Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: Temperature and what other environmental factor are important in the activity of an enzyme?   A: Answer:","output":"Temperature and pH level are the two main environmental factors that are important in the activity of an enzyme. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They play a crucial role in various biological processes, including digestion, metabolism, and cellular respiration. To function optimally, enzymes require specific conditions in their environment, such as a particular temperature and pH level. The activity of an enzyme is highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Each enzyme has a specific temperature range within which it performs its function most efficiently. This optimal temperature usually corresponds to the temperature at which the organism lives or operates. For instance, human enzymes generally have an optimal temperature of around 37°C (98.6°F), which is the average body temperature. As the temperature moves further away from the optimal range, the enzyme's activity decreases. Extremely high or low temperatures can even cause enzymes to denature, meaning they lose their structure and functionality, thereby becoming inactive. In addition to temperature, pH level is another crucial environmental factor affecting enzyme activity. Similar to temperature, each enzyme has a specific pH range within which it performs optimally. This optimal pH level depends on the specific enzyme and the environment of its activity within the organism. For example, pepsin, an enzyme involved in digestion, works best within the acidic environment of the stomach, which has a pH level of around 1.5-3.0. On the other hand, trypsin, another digestive enzyme, functions best in the slightly alkaline environment of the small intestine, with a pH level of around 7.5-8.5. Changes in pH levels can disrupt the enzyme's structure, leading to reduced activity or denaturation. Hence, maintaining the appropriate pH level is critical for enzyme function. In summary, temperature and pH level are the two main environmental factors that significantly affect the activity of an enzyme. Both factors have specific optimal ranges for different enzymes, and maintaining these conditions is essential to ensure the proper functioning of enzymes in living organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The increase in the number of butterflies in the environment could lead to less caterpillar growth due to the following perturbation: indirectly impacting a step of the process. This can be explained in more detail as follows: When the number of butterflies in the environment increases, several factors can indirectly impact the growth and development of caterpillars. These factors include: 1. Availability of food: As the number of butterflies increases, the availability of food resources for caterpillars may decrease. Butterflies and caterpillars usually compete for the same food sources, such as leaves and plants. As a result, with more butterflies present, there might be fewer resources left for caterpillars to consume, leading to slower growth and potentially a reduction in caterpillar population. 2. Predation: An increase in the butterfly population can attract more predators, such as birds, spiders, and other insects, to the area. This may cause an increase in predation pressure on both butterflies and caterpillars. As the predators search for butterflies, they may also come across caterpillars, leading to a decrease in the caterpillar population. 3. Parasitism: Butterflies and caterpillars can be hosts to various parasites, such as parasitic wasps and flies. An increased butterfly population may attract more parasites to the area, which may cause a higher number of infections in both butterfly and caterpillar populations. This can lead to a decrease in caterpillar growth and overall population. 4. Changes in the ecosystem: The increased butterfly population can also cause changes in the ecosystem that indirectly affect caterpillar growth. For example, a large number of butterflies feeding on a particular type of plant can cause an imbalance in the plant population, leading to less food for caterpillars. Moreover, this can cause other species in the ecosystem to respond differently, which can indirectly impact the availability of resources and habitat for caterpillars. 5. Competition: With more butterflies in the environment, there might be an increase in competition for shelter, food, and mates among both butterflies and caterpillars. This competition can lead to reduced growth and survival rates for caterpillars, possibly resulting in a decreased caterpillar population. In conclusion, the perturbation of the increased butterfly population in the environment indirectly impacts a step of the process. This can lead to less caterpillar growth due to factors such as competition for food, availability of resources, predation, parasitism, and changes in the ecosystem. These indirect impacts may lead to a decrease in the caterpillar population, which highlights the complex and interconnected nature of ecological relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author?

Article: Correction: Earlier versions of this article included a credit line that incorrectly said that reporter Michael Birnbaum contributed from Manama.Also, this article cited the fact that the State Department has not recalled its ambassador as evidence of the Obama administration’s muted objections to Bahrain’s actions. The United States has not recalled any top diplomats because of the crackdown, but it currently has no ambassador in Bahrain; the last ambassador returned to the United States in January to take up a post at the State Department.      Two months after the eruption of mass protests in Bahrain, the kingdom has largely silenced the opposition, jailing hundreds of activists in a crackdown that has left the Obama administration vulnerable to charges that it is upholding democratic values in the Middle East selectively.      Bahrain’s monarchy, since calling in Saudi troops last month to help crush the protest movement, has been quietly dismantling the country’s Shiite-led opposition. On Friday, the Sunni government announced an investigation into the activities of Bahrain’s largest political party, the Shiite-dominated al-Wefaq, which could lead to its ban.      The Obama administration has repeatedly appealed to the Bahraini government for restraint, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton this week called for a political process that “advances the rights and aspirations of all the citizens of Bahrain.” But the administration has neither recalled its ambassador to Manama nor threatened the kinds of sanctions it imposed on Libya — a striking disparity that is fueling ­anti-U.S. sentiment among Bahraini opposition groups.      “Even though the American administration’s words are all about freedom and democracy and change, in Bahrain, the reality is that they’re basically a protection for the dictatorship,” said Zainab al-Khawaja, a prominent human-rights activist who began a hunger strike after her father, husband and brother-in-law were arrested at her apartment over the weekend.      U.S. officials privately acknowledge that the administration has been understated in its criticism of Bahrain, in part to avoid further strain in relations with Saudi Arabia, a vital U.S. ally and neighbor to the tiny island kingdom. The Saudis, fearing the rise of a pro-Iranian Shiite state on its eastern frontier, urged Bahrain to deal firmly with the throng of protesters that occupied a central square and blocked access to Manama’s main business district.      A month later, however, with Bahrain’s iron first tightening further, the White House is facing awkward questions from political allies as well as foes. A perceived U.S. double standard on Middle East democracy — a problem since the Arab spring movement began three months ago — could become more acute if Washington is seen to ignore widespread abuses, according to current and former diplomats and regional experts.      “We need to worry about the human-rights situation deteriorating there,” said Joel Rubin, a former Middle East specialist for the State Department and deputy director of the National Security Network, a Democratic-leaning foreign policy think tank. “It has a real impact on perceptions of American policy in the region.”      U.S. officials defend the administration’s ad hoc approach to Middle East democracy movements as prudent, saying each country requires a unique balancing of democratic ideals and compelling security interests.      “We don’t make decisions about questions like intervention based on consistency or precedent,” Denis R. McDonough, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, said recently in explaining why U.S. policy on Libya differs from that on Bahrain. “We make them based on how we can best advance our interests in the region.”      In the case of Bahrain, the United States has key military interests. The kingdom is home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet; it is also seen as a strategically important bulwark against Iranian power in the region. But even more vital is the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, a critical ally in the Middle East for half a century.      Saudi Arabia and the United States have fundamentally different views of what is happening in Bahrain, why it is happening and who is responsible for it. Saudi officials deny that Bahrain has cracked down on legitimate demonstrators, insisting that action has been taken only against radicals seeking to provoke the government. A senior U.S. official held the opposite view, saying: “The crackdown is a fact.”      Administration officials accept that Bahrain is the Saudi “back yard,” a point emphasized by a member of the Saudi legislative council, Majlis al-Shura, during a visit to Washington last week. “Bahrain is our Cuba,” said the official, who spoke at a forum organized by the New America Foundation.      “We don’t believe the uprising is real,” said another shura member. Most of Bahrain’s Shiites “are happy; a small minority is causing the problem,” he said. “Maybe some are oppressed, but 1 percent is causing the trouble.”      Whatever the makeup of the protest movement, the intensity of the crackdown stunned Bahraini opposition leaders as well as many Middle East experts, who are dismayed by the dismantling of reforms that had cemented the island’s reputation as progressive and Western-friendly. Until the crackdown on March 14, many of the thousands of protesters who jammed the capital’s Pearl Square were confident that the movement sweeping the region would bring new political freedoms and economic equality for the country’s majority Shiite population.      “Only a month ago, we had a feeling of change and respect for democracy and human rights. Now we feel as though we are all in a big prison,” said Mohammed al-Maskati, president of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights. “They want to attack everyone who was involved in the protests.”      In addition to jailing activists and banning Shiite-led opposition parties, Bahraini authorities fired civil servants and even professional athletes who participated in demonstrations.      The country’s only independent newspaper was taken over last week and its editor forced to resign. And on Monday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch alleged that at least three opposition figures had died in Bahraini prisons under suspicious circumstances. While Bahraini authorities attributed the deaths to natural causes, Human Rights Watch said in a report that one of the victims’ bodies bore “signs of horrific abuse.”      Some government opponents accuse the United States of failing to put enough pressure on Bahrain and the neighboring Persian Gulf kingdoms that supported the crackdown. One prominent human rights activist described Bahraini protesters as “very, very disappointed” by the mild American response.      Clinton defended the U.S. role in a speech this week at a meeting of the U.S.-Islamic World Forum, insisting that the United States’ “core interests and values have not changed, including our commitment to promote human rights.” But Clinton cited other goals, including the defeat of terrorism and the containment of Iran, as “mutual interests.”      “We know that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t make sense in such a diverse region at such a fluid time,” she said.      Clinton mentioned Bahrain only briefly, hailing what she called a “decades-long friendship with Bahrain that we expect to continue long into the future.” But, referring to the recent crackdown, she added that “violence is not and cannot be the answer.”      “We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so,” Clinton said.      Birnbaum reported from Berlin. Staff writer Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| When thousands of protesters spilled into Bahrain's streets in February, Dr. Mohammed Al-Muharraqi, a self-professed pessimist, thought his country might change for the better.Though most of the demonstrators gathering in the capital's Pearl Square roundabout were Shiite Muslims and he is a Sunni Muslim, Muharraqi was excited to hear them voice hopes he'd long shared.\\"When it started, we found it really, really cool,\\" Muharraqi said. \\"They wanted a more equal distribution of wealth, less unemployment, more parliamentary power. If those were the things the protests were about, then we felt, 'Go, roundabout!'\\"For an exhilarating moment, the protests united many Bahrainis.One of them was a young Shiite professional who had been apolitical all his life, and who was inspired to become an opposition blogger. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said he became convinced that the protest movement's peaceful tactics could bring change to Bahrain's monarchy.Another was Kefaya Almubarak, a social worker and mother of three, who saw a future with better jobs and pay.Now, their hopes have been dashed. The fate of authoritarian regimes in Libya and Yemen is still unclear, but in Bahrain, a key U.S. ally, the state has won, and life is worse for most people than it was before the heady early days in Pearl Square.The uprising deepened the divide between the majority Shiites and minority Sunnis in this Persian Gulf island-state.Many Sunnis, aligned with the government, welcome what they say is the restoration of law and order. Shiites inhabit an entirely different reality: a police state where checkpoints limit movement, the wounded avoid hospitals for fear of arrest and people simply disappear, with the unlucky ones turning up at the morgue.Only a clear sense of loss — loss of loved ones, of economic security, of easy coexistence — seems to unite Bahrainis today.\\"Before, we were talking about change,\\" the opposition blogger said. \\"But now, we just want the bleeding to stop.\\"At the end of a long day, Muharraqi needed a smoke at his favorite outdoor hookah cafe. His credentials at the island's main military hospital allowed him to get through the checkpoints that spring up after curfew so he could enjoy a night out. As he sipped juice and puffed on the hookah, he described his early excitement about the uprising, and his eventual disillusionment.After 20 years in Britain, Muharraqi said, he had returned to Bahrain hoping for a quiet life practicing plastic surgery and administering Botox shots.When the protests began Feb. 14, people asked for better economic opportunities, a constitutional monarchy and an end to discrimination against Shiites. Three days later, just before dawn, government forces with guns and tear gas raided Pearl Square , killing at least seven people.Soon afterward, Bahrain's more radical parties, which seek an end to the monarchy, began setting the agenda for the opposition.Sunni sympathy for the protest movement began to evaporate when some demonstrators last month tried to enter the Sunni area of Riffa to protest at the royal family's residences. Sunnis were further alienated, Muharraqi said, when protesters barricaded the financial district, disrupting the economy.\\"I felt the movement had grown horns and fangs and claws,\\" Muharraqi said. \\"I felt stuck in the middle. I didn't want a change in government; it hadn't done anything to me.\\"His anger intensified after a wounded man was brought into the emergency room at the military hospital. A YouTube video shows the man being run over twice by an SUV and then kicked and beaten with sticks. But the blurry video is subject to divergent interpretations.According to the government, the victim was a policeman and his assailants were protesters. According to the opposition, the man was a civilian and the attackers state security agents. The man died of his injuries. |||||Summary:","output":"The Bahraini government has largely silenced the opposition, jailing hundreds of activists and dismantling the country’s Shiite-led opposition.

Gaffe-prone Vice President Joe Biden has learned a thing or two during his 64 months in the Obama administration, including the need to avoid broadcasting F-bombs like the one he let loose on Mar 23, 2010. That was the day the president triumphantly announced the signing of the Affordable Care Act. But Biden unwittingly stole the spotlight by introducing Obama, embracing him and saying – loudly enough for the podium microphone to capture it – 'This is a big f***ing deal.' '[A] piece of advice about that \\"BFD\\" stuff:. Assume every microphone is on,' Biden told a crowd gathered on Monday at the starting line of the annual Ride 2 Recovery Memorial Challenge, a cycling event that raises money for wounded-veterans charities. Scroll down for video of the infamous moment. I didn't mean it: Biden insisted he never intentionally called the Obamacare signing 'a big f***ing deal,' but his words looking intentional on network video feeds. Gaffer-in-chief: Biden's famous moments have included asking a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge applause,and saying of the 2009 federal stimulus that there was 'a 30% chance we're going to get it wrong' Riders travel 325 miles from Washington, D.C. to Virginia Beach every year on Memorial Day for the event. 'I just want. you to know, I didn't intentionally say that,' he added, according to CNN. 'I actually turned and I said, \\"Mr. President,\\" and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips — not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips.' 'Thank God my mother was. gone or I'd have been one dead vice president.' His words, however, were clearly audible and went out on every broadcast network covering the event. The Associated Press reported at the time that 'Biden appeared to be offering that perspective to Obama privately.' Moments later, then-White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs tweeted, 'And yes, Mr. Vice President, you're right.' A Ride 2 Recovery coordinator who introduced Biden playfully warned the crowd that 'for those of you who don't know, Joe is famous for some of his one liners.' 'There was a bill signing at the White House ... and he said it was a \\"big f-ing deal.\\" And that was a quote ... If I may say, sir, Ride to Recovery is a big f-ing deal.' The introduction also included the prediction. that 'at some point in the future Joe is going to run for president. again.' In response, Biden was seen making a dramatic sign of the cross on his body. Biden's mouth often out-runs his brain, as he proved in 2010 with an open microphone and an F-bomb. Goofball: Biden mugged for a camera with Obama to launch his Instagram account, but was better-known for saying that in his home state of Delaware, 'you cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.' The vice president, who is mulling a White House run in 2016, also mentioned the controversy swirling around the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which is accused of using phony off-the-books waiting lists to mask its failure to provide timely health care to battle-tested servicemen and women. 'That is a sacred obligation, and we’re behind right now,' the he conceded. 'The VA is having problems, and we’ve got to get to the bottom of it.' 'This is a long-term commitment this nation has to make,' Biden said, 'so it seems to me on this day we as Americans have to recommit ourselves not just with words but with deeds.'

McCain settling in as Republican Party leader McCain settling in as Republican Party leader By Liz Sidoti, Associated Press WASHINGTON  John McCain, a longtime Republican Party agitator, is easing into the role of its newfound leader. He has met abroad with world leaders, intensified fundraising and taken control of the party apparatus. He is thinking about running mates and is introducing himself to the country. He's also made a few missteps and watched a challenging political terrain that favors Democrats grow more troublesome for the GOP. \\"We're making the kind of progress I think needs to be made,\\" the senator from Arizona said this week, expressing confidence — despite the private concerns of some Republicans — that his team is embracing the opportunity afforded him as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama continue to spar for the Democratic nod. \\"We've done a pretty good job of unifying our party. Now we've got to energize our party.\\" In the month since he clinched the GOP nomination and his White House campaign entered a new phase, McCain has moved forward on all fronts — from message to mechanics — to position himself for November's general election. His first stretch as the GOP's nominee-in-waiting, however, has not been without hiccups. McCain faced fallout from an endorsement by a televangelist who has made anti-Catholic comments and confronted questions about his ties to lobbyists. He invited criticism with a speech that derided aggressive federal intervention in the housing crisis but offered no immediate relief for homeowners threatened with foreclosure. And, he mistakenly said Iran was allowing al-Qaeda fighters into its country to be trained and returned to Iraq. At the same time, the landscape became more problematic for Republicans. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said this week for the first time that a recession is possible, and the government rescued investment house Bear Stearns from collapse as the housing and credit crises continue to roil Wall Street. The Iraq war entered its sixth year and U.S. troop deaths topped 4,000 amid renewed violence in the southern Shiite region and the shelling of the U.S.-controlled Green Zone in Baghdad. In spite of the hurdles, McCain said: \\"I'm glad to be where we are. We're going to keep working hard.\\" Polls show McCain would be in strong contention with either Clinton or Obama in a head-to-head matchup. Nonetheless, Democratic loyalists appear far more enthusiastic — and willing to donate — than the GOP rank-and-file, while President Bush's support remains low and most people say the country is on the wrong track amid the unpopular Iraq war and fragile economy. Still, McCain has had the luxury of focusing on the general election while his Democratic rivals remain embroiled in a tight contest. Each Democrat props up McCain daily, assailing him in hopes of appearing to be the strongest one to take him on in November. \\"John McCain wants to continue the war in Iraq. I want to end it,\\" Obama said this week. And, Clinton launched an ad in Pennsylvania that claims \\"John McCain just said the government shouldn't take any real action on the housing crisis, he'd let the phone keep ringing.\\" As Democrats bicker, McCain has focused on these areas: •Money: Fundraising is arguably his biggest weakness and, thus, highest priority. He raised only 11 million in February to a combined 80 million for Clinton and Obama, and has been slow to sign up many of Bush's big donors. Obama reported raising 40 million in March; Clinton said she raised 20 million. McCain is likely to surpass his February total but still trail his rivals. He held dozens of fundraisers last month and set up joint fundraising accounts with the Republican National Committee to encourage donations. •Unity: Trying to heal wounds from a divisive GOP primary was a high priority for a candidate who has spent decades bucking the party on issues that resonate with conservatives. In hopes of getting critics to swing behind him, McCain appeared with Bush in the White House Rose Garden and received Nancy Reagan's endorsement. He also campaigned with former GOP rival Mitt Romney to show solidarity. •Message: Speaking to a broader electorate, McCain, a former Navy pilot held prisoner during the Vietnam War, has cast himself as an experienced wartime commander in chief and statesman with his own vision, despite Democratic efforts to paint him as a Bush clone. McCain visited the Middle East, including Iraq, and Europe, where he met with allies. Stateside, he embarked on a week-long biographical tour and began an ad campaign. •Structure: McCain has dispatched four high-level allies to the RNC — Frank Donatelli, Lew Eisenberg, Carly Fiorina and Mike DuHaime — to meld its fundraising, get-out-the-vote and party-building operations with his own growing organization. His northern Virginia headquarters has hired more staffers and is creating offices in 10 regions of the country to decentralize the campaign. •Vice President: McCain has a list of some 20 names from which he could choose a running mate and says he's in the \\"embryonic stages\\" of selecting someone.

Juliette \\"Jules\\" Paxton (Keira Knightley) is the same age and the daughter of a native English family. Jess is infatuated with football, but because she's a woman, her family won't let her play. However, she sometimes plays in the park with boys including her best friend, Tony (Ameet Chana), a closet homosexual.Whilst on a jog through the park, Jules discovers Jess' skills, befriends her, and invites her to try out for the local women's football team, the Hounslow Harriers coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Jess is extremely happy and excited about the tryouts, even though Joe is skeptical about a new player joining the team. After seeing Jess' skills, Joe accepts her on the team and Jess lies to Joe about her parents being cool with the idea.Jess develops an attraction toward Joe, and when the team plays in Hamburg and goes out clubbing, they're caught about to kiss by Jules, who also has a crush on Joe, souring Jess and Jules' friendship, as Jules is adamant she'd told Jess about her crush. When Jess goes to Jules' house to try to patch up their friendship, Jules' mother (Juliet Stevenson) is misled and thinks they're hiding a lesbian relationship.Meanwhile, having discovered that Jess has been playing football behind their backs, Jess' parents (Anupam Kher) and (Shaheen Khan) become more strict and forbid Jess from playing any more matches. The elder Bhamras are also distracted by their elaborate wedding plans for Jess' older sister, Pinky (Archie Panjabi).Thanks to Jess and Jules' skills, the Harriers reach the finals of the league tournament. Unfortunately, the final and Pinky's wedding are on the same day. Joe pleads with Mr. Bhamra to allow Jess to play, but Mr. Bhamra refuses, revealing that he doesn't want Jess to suffer the same way he did when he was kicked out of the cricket club because of his being an Indian.Joe accepts that Jess isn't allowed to play, and the final begins without her.... Answer:","output":"How does Jess manage to balance her passion for football with her cultural and familial obligations, and what impact does her secret involvement with the Hounslow Harriers have on her relationship with her family and friends?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. According to the above context, answer the following question. The author probably believes that OPTIONS: [a].

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was in ever-present danger of relapse on drugs? , can you please find it?   Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: \\"We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.\\" By the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. \\"Throw Away Your Television,\\" while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other \\"experimental\\" tracks include the melodica-based \\"On Mercury.\\" \\"Cabron,\\" the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has distinctive Latin influences. \\"Tear\\" and \\"Warm Tape\\" were keyboard based more so than guitar or bass, the latter being completely written on the instrument.

Some states require that you belong to certain professions, such as law, accounting, medicine, engineering, or architecture. However, other states, such as New York, define \\"professional services\\" a little more broadly. Therefore, it is crucial to check your state's specific definition of \\"professional services\\" to determine whether your occupation qualifies for the formation of a PLLC. In addition to verifying your eligibility, it will also be vital to explore the benefits and obligations associated with forming a PLLC. Some common advantages of a PLLC include limited liability protection, which safeguards an individual's personal assets from the company's debts and liabilities, and potential tax advantages. On the other hand, associated obligations may include annual filings, taxes, and potential fees to maintain the entity's active status. Once you have familiarized yourself with your state's requirements and the nuances of a PLLC, you may begin compiling the necessary documentation for the registration process. Typically, this will involve drafting an Articles of Organization document, which outlines key information about your PLLC, such as its name, purpose, and members' names. Additionally, some states mandate the adoption of an operating agreement, which is an internal document detailing how the PLLC will be run and governed. When your paperwork is ready, submit your completed forms, along with the required filing fee, to your state's relevant regulatory agency. The processing time for PLLC registration may vary from state to state; however, once approved, your PLLC will officially be recognized as a legal business entity. As you commence operations, it would also be prudent to seek the advice of an attorney or a qualified business professional to ensure your PLLC remains compliant with all pertinent regulations moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? The meadows is home to a large number of tennis courts (16 to be precise) that are open for play throughout the year.  The system they operate here is that in peak times it will be staffed and you have to pay to get in, but in down times it will be open and free for use.  Needless to say the latter proves to be very popular though the former is enjoyed by many real tennis fans.  A court will cost u00a38 (u00a34.50 if under 18) or u00a36 with a card which to buy will set you back u00a315 if you are a student or young adult and u00a350 otherwise.  The hours when you will pay these fees vary through the year, but in April - June and September the courts are staffed and hence cost money from 16:00 - 21:00 Monday to Friday and 10:00 - 18:00 Saturday to Sunder.

Answer: OPT: (I). No (II). Yes Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, the user would likely not recommend this product. The user initially commented on the positive aspect of the product, stating that it looks good and stable. However, the user then proceeded to share their negative experiences with the product. Firstly, the user mentioned that they experienced water leakage from the drain during the first time use. This indicates that the product may have design or manufacturing issues, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, the user stated that after several uses, the product stopped working. A product that fails to function properly after a short period can be frustrating for the customer, and significantly impact their opinion of the product. The user also stated that it took 7 months for the product to completely fail, which further supports the conclusion that the user would not recommend this product. A good quality product is expected to last much longer than this time frame, leading one to believe that the user is unhappy with the product's durability. Regarding the user's question about using distilled water – it may or may not be related to the problem. Usage of distilled water is typically a good practice when using products that involve water, as it minimizes the risk of mineral buildup and potential damage. Therefore, it is unlikely that using distilled water would cause the issues experienced by the user. Hence, it would be safe to say that the problem lies with the product itself. In conclusion, based on the user's negative experiences, the water leakage, the product's failure within a relatively short period, and the fact that distilled water usage should not have contributed to these issues, it is highly likely that the user would not recommend this product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Olympus is to release a pair of 'techno-glasses' that put a computer display directly in front of your eyes - and can also make the world itself look cheerier by turning up the brightness. The MEG4.0 glasses work with a see-through display called a 'pupil division optical system', and displays information such as emails from a smartphone linked to the glasses via Bluetooth. Olympus is the latest tech giant to throw its weight behind 'techno-glasses' - both Apple and Google are now investigating the technology. Olympus's glasses link to a smartphone via Bluetooth to display information such as emails - they also have built-in GPS and an accelerometer to deliver mapping information. Olympus's glasses - at the prototype stage at present - are lightweight, battery-powered and last for a reported eight hours. The glasses have a GPS system and accelerometer built in, which could be used to deliver information about the local area direct to their 320x240 display. Tech site The Register said that momentum is gathering behind the idea of 'wearable computers.' 'With Olympus, Google and Apple involved in the area you can bet your last dollar other companies are looking into it too,' said the site's Chris Mellor. Apple filed a patent referring to, 'Methods. and apparatus, including computer program products, implementing and. using techniques for projecting a source image in a head-mounted display. apparatus for a user.'

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: With smart phones taking the world by Storm, a phone that can only send and receive voice calls and text messages may seem like a relic from a bygone age. Yet in East Africa,simple phones like these are changing the face of the economy, thanks to the mobile money services that are spreading across the region.     Using the text-messaging function built into the GSM system used by most cell phone networks, these services allow people without a bank account or credit card to use their phone as an electronic wallet that can be used to store. send or receive cash.      It works like this: you pay cash to your local agent who then tops up your mobile money account using a secure form of text messaging. That money can be transferred to another person by sending a message to their cell phone account.      For some the system is a lifeline. \\"If I didn't have my mobile phone. I would be very poor, \\"says Neyasse Neemur, a mother of four children who lives in northern Kenya. \\"Now I can sell fish.\\"      Neemur took up fishing in July last year, but making money from it was a little tricky, especially as Turkana people do not usually eat fish. A truck from Ethiopia to Tanzania passes through her village once a week, and she arranged to have the driver transport the fish several hundred kilometres south to market in Kisumu, where her  s sell the fish.     \\"I get the money transfer immediately.\\" says Neemur. \\"Then I can pay for my children to go to school and for vegetables and beans,\\" she adds, \\"so I don't need to eat fish.\\"     According to the Central Bank of Kenya, payments worth around l billion Kenyan shillings(13 million)per day were transferred through Kenya's mobile money systems in 2009, equaling the country's credit card transactions . The bank expects mobile money transfers to overtake credit cards in 2011. Question: What can we learn about the simple phones in East Africa?

You may feel too sad or tired to eat right, sleep well, and exercise, but all of these things will help you to recover as quickly as possible. Things like exercise will also give your brain the extra positivity it needs to get through this rough patch, since it produces the happiness chemical serotonin. Enlist the help of friends if you're having a hard time with self-care. Make dinner with people you're close to or go to the gym with someone who is into exercising consistently. Distracting yourself from your pain may seem like a good idea in the moment, but it will only increase the amount of time it takes you to process the breakup. This can make it more difficult not to bring your residual feelings into new relationships and other areas of your life.  Talking it out with a friend can give you a good way of reflecting on your feelings. Make sure it's someone you trust to be sensitive with your emotions and really listen to what you are saying. Avoid using alcohol or other substances to keep your feelings away. In the long run this will only hurt you. Focus on the positive aspects of the breakup. Writing will help you organize your thoughts and begin to process all of the difficult emotions that go along with a breakup. Specifically writing about what went right in the breakup is better for you than just venting.  Was he honest and straightforward when he told you he was into someone else? Did he let you know what was going on before it got serious with the new person? It's important to give yourself time to heal. Straining yourself too hard, like jumping straight into a new relationship, overworking yourself, or just pushing yourself to move on can make the situation worse. Emotional injuries, like physical injuries, require time to fully heal. Give yourself the space to rest and recover. Don't be afraid to say no if friends want you to go out and you don't feel like it. True friends will understand that you need time before you can return to your normal way of being. It's easy in our culture to buy into the idea of there being only one person for you, but in reality there are a lot of people in the world that you are compatible with. Avoid telling yourself stories about how this person was the only one for you, or that you'll never find anyone like him. In all likelihood you will find someone else, and he might be even better than this guy. You may eventually find an amazing fit with someone, but when that happens then neither of you will want to break up.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of self-care in the aftermath of a romantic breakup, as it helps in the recovery process. It advises maintaining a healthy lifestyle through proper eating, sleeping, and exercising, which can boost positivity by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Seeking support from friends and engaging in self-care activities with them can be helpful. Distracting oneself from the pain may seem appealing, but it can prolong the healing process, making it difficult to move on and maintain healthy future relationships. Instead, the article suggests talking to a trusted friend who will be sensitive and listen to one's emotions. It discourages resorting to alcohol or other substances as a coping mechanism, as it can cause long-term harm. Focusing on the positive aspects of the breakup, such as honesty and communication, can prove beneficial. Writing about these aspects can help process emotions and can be more effective than merely venting. The article cautions against rushing into new relationships or pushing oneself too hard, as emotional injuries require time to heal, just like physical injuries. Allowing oneself space to rest and recover is essential, and it's important to prioritize one's well-being, even if it means declining social invitations from friends. Lastly, the article addresses the widely-held belief that each individual has only one perfect match. Instead, it reassures readers that there are likely many people with whom they may be compatible. It encourages individuals to avoid focusing on the belief that their former partner was the only one for them or that they won't find a better match. The article concludes with the notion that finding the right partner means neither person would want to end the relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Do these mean the same? He played only one appearance in 2012 and then debuted 4 times the following year . He debuted in 2012 making only 1 appearance and then played 4 times the following year .","output":"While both sentences convey similar ideas regarding the individual's participation in the game, they do not mean exactly the same thing. Let's analyze them separately: 1. Sentence 1: \\"He played only one appearance in 2012 and then debuted 4 times the following year.\\" This sentence suggests that the individual played in 2012 with only one appearance (referring to just one game or match). However, the use of the term \\"debuted\\" in the latter part of the sentence, \\"debuted 4 times the following year,\\" is not accurate since a debut implies a first appearance or introduction. A player can only debut once, and the repetition mentioned in this sentence does not make sense in this context. 2. Sentence 2: \\"He debuted in 2012 making only 1 appearance and then played 4 times the following year.\\" This sentence is more coherent and clear. It explains that the individual debuted, or made their first appearance, in 2012, participating in only one game or match. The sentence then goes on to provide information about the following year, stating that the individual played four times. The use of \\"played\\" instead of \\"debuted\\" in the second half of the sentence is more appropriate in this context. In conclusion, while both sentences discuss the individual's participation over two years, they are not identical in meaning. The first sentence contains an improper use of the term \\"debuted,\\" while the second sentence is clearer and accurately describes the individual's participation in 2012 and the year that followed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the first name of the person who has released his most personal album to date?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Youssou N'Dour: I Bring What I Love is a music-driven film that explores one man's power to inspire global change. The film unfolds at a pivotal moment in the life of Youssou N'Dour—the best-selling African pop artist of all time. N'Dour has long been renowned for bringing people of diverse nations and backgrounds together through his collaborations with such musical superstars as Bono, Paul Simon, and Peter Gabriel. But when he releases his most personal and spiritual album yet, he instead alienates his Muslim fans in Africa. Although he garners accolades in the West, N'Dour must brave controversy and rejection at home as he sets out to win his audience back. Director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi tracks N'Dour's journey over two years – filming his life in Africa, Europe, and America. He initially releases his album Egypt in the hopes of promoting a more tolerant face of Islam. Yet, when his fellow Senegalese reject the album, and denounce it as blasphemous, he takes this as a challenge to go deeper, to reach out to those who would attack him, and to work even harder to use his songs to unite a divided world. The resulting portrait is not just of a musician, but also that of a world in which pop culture now has equal power to incite fury and invite new connections.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed alongside Nelson Mandela, said that Mr Zuma's resignation would end a \\"crisis of confidence\\" in the government. Mr Zuma said on Friday he would repay the money but would remain in his post. He has faced widespread calls for his resignation from South Africa's opposition. South Africa's highest court ruled that Mr Zuma had failed to uphold the constitution by ignoring instructions to repay some of the 16m in state funds spent on renovations at his private residence. In a televised address on Friday, Mr Zuma made no reference to the calls for his resignation. Can Zuma survive after apology? The leadership of Mr Zuma's party, the African National Congress, said it was united behind its leader, but the intervention of  86-year-old Mr Kathrada, a party veteran, may carry weight. Along with Mr Mandela, Mr Kathrada was among eight ANC activists sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of trying to overthrow the apartheid government during the 1963-1964 Rivonia Trial. In an open letter published in South African media, Mr Kathrada said: \\"In the face of such persistently widespread criticism, condemnation and demand, is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum, to consider stepping down? \\"I know that if I were in the president's shoes, I would step down with immediate effect.\\" The scandal is arguably the biggest yet to hit Mr Zuma, who has fended off accusations of corruption and cronyism since before he took office in 2009. The public protector, an anti-corruption body, ruled in 2014 that 23m of public money had been improperly spent on Mr Zuma's rural home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal province, and ordered him to reimburse part of the expense. South African papers are abuzz with reactions to President Jacob Zuma's apology for improper spending on his rural home, and speculation about what he will do next. The Johannesburg Star's Janet Smith says Mr Zuma must be observing events in Brazil , where there are growing calls for the resignation of President Dilma Rousseff over corruption charges. The Sowetan's report about Mr Zuma's apology is overshadowed by the ongoing saga involving the president and the Indian-born Gupta family, which has allegedly been allowed undue influence. The paper's front-page comment yesterday was headlined \\"It's official: he's a failed president\\" In the Mail and Guardian, Carien du Plessis foresees difficulties for the ruling ANC if Mr Zuma were to resign, saying: \\"In a party split down the middle in more or less equal factions... things are more likely to fall apart.\\" Business Day's reports about the apology includes opposition Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane's description of it as an insult, and ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe's efforts to discourage calls for the president to step down. The president claimed he had acted \\"in good faith\\" and \\"never knowingly and deliberately set out to violate the constitution\\". \\"Any action that has been found not to be in keeping with the constitution happened because of a different approach and different legal advice,\\" he said, before issuing an apology for the \\"frustration\\" caused. The case had been brought by two opposition parties, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Democratic Alliance (DA). They have launched impeachment proceedings against Mr Zuma, but these are unlikely to be successful because of the ANC's large majority in parliament. Summary:","output":"South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, faces criticism and calls for his resignation after it was discovered that he improperly spent public funds on his private residence; he has apologized and agreed to repay some of the money."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ralph Nader is entering the presidential race as an independent, he announced Sunday, saying it is time for a \\"Jeffersonian revolution.\\" Ralph Nader is running for president as an independent. \\"In the last few years, big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevent us from trying to improve our country.

Calling Nader's move \\"very unfortunate,\\" Sen.","output":"Dianne Feinstein expressed concern that Nader's candidacy could potentially draw votes away from the Democratic nominee and unintentionally bolster support for the Republican candidate. \\"Ralph Nader has a long history as an advocate, but this isn't the time for a third-party candidate to potentially divide the progressive vote,\\" she told CNN in a statement. Despite these concerns, Nader remained steadfast in his decision to run and quickly began forming his campaign team. He announced a platform that emphasized campaign finance reform, environmental protection, universal healthcare, and workers' rights, attracting a significant following among progressive voters who felt frustrated with the political establishment. The two major party nominees, Democratic candidate John Smith and Republican candidate Jane Doe, both acknowledged Nader's entry into the race and vowed to focus on engaging voters and outlining their policy proposals, rather than worrying about the impact of his candidacy. As the election season progressed, Nader's campaign continued to gain momentum – particularly in several key battleground states. Pundits debated the influence of Nader's campaign on the race, with some arguing that he was providing a necessary voice for disaffected voters and others asserting that he was damaging the chances of the Democratic nominee. In the end, the election proved to be one of the closest in US history. Some analysts theorized that Nader's presence in the race had played a role in dividing voter support among progressives, ultimately giving the Republican candidate a narrow advantage in several crucial states. In the aftermath of the election, Nader defended his decision to run, pointing out that his campaign had brought national attention to important issues such as corporate influence in politics and the need for significant environmental reforms. Despite the outcome, he vowed to continue his work as an advocate for the public and as a force for political change in the United States. The election's results fueled ongoing conversations about the role of third-party candidates in the American political system. The increased visibility of Nader's campaign and its impact on the race sparked renewed discussions about the importance of alternative voices in politics and the merits of potentially overhauling the nation's electoral process to accommodate them. Though Ralph Nader did not achieve his goal of becoming president, his campaign left a lasting impact on the American political landscape and served as a catalyst for further debate on the role of third-party and independent candidates in shaping the future of the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.  After reading the above, is \\"Dar el Ansar, which means house of the followers\\" the correct answer to the question \\"The four became somewhat of a sect meeting 3 to 4 times a week and what was it that Atta would write on the rent checks?\\"?

This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\\"Grandfather Vulture\\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \\"big chief\\" who \\"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\\" according to Miguel Orrego.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

Article: Dior was born in Normandy in 1905, and his family's original plans for him included a career in the diplomatic service, but by the time he was twenty-three, with his parents'money, he opened a small art gallery in Paris. By 1931, the money had been used up. Dior's friends in the art gallery, asked him to draw and he took his first step at designing and drawing. His first job was with Lucien Lelong from whom Dior learned his craft . In February,1947, Dior started the New Look in his first major Paris collection. He was backed by a famous textile producer, Boussac, who looked after the dollars, while Dior looked after the fashions. Dior knew nothing about cutting and sewing, but he was good at fashion design. The New Look started an entirely different look to costume, with a tiny waist, a rounded shoulder and a shapely bust , usually with a low-cut neckline and a long full skirt. To women who had lived through the war years, the femaleness of the New look was a great success, for people were tired of tile extremely plain, wartime restrictive fashions. It is said that dresses by Dior were \\"constructed like buildings\\", but young people were attracted to his design, and all over the western world, manufacturers plunged  into the production of his new style. Dior's revolutionary designs lighted up a whole cycle of fashion, rounded, gentle, feminine, a delight in elegance. A New Look House of Dior opened in 1948, followed by one in London. Considered as King of Couture(women's clothing)for years, the Dior empire grew until it covered every country in the western world, and included furs, hosiery, jewelry, perfumes, men's wear and on and on. More than 1,000 people worked at the Paris headquarters then. His sudden death in 1957 when he was 53 years old did not stop the growth of the House of Dior.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera.

He now meets Novak Djokovic - who beat him in last week's Madrid Open final - after the Serb defeated Kei Nishikori. In the women's singles, top seed Serena Williams will face Madison Keys on Sunday in an all-American final. World number three Murray, who will be 29 on Sunday, broke serve four times as he won in 59 minutes. The first semi-final was delayed by an hour because of heavy rain, and the players were forced off for 15 minutes during the first set. \\"I think it is the first time since I've been on Tour that I've not had a chance to hit balls before going on to the court,\\" said Murray. \\"It pretty much rained non-stop and then they flipped the schedule around so I didn't feel that comfortable coming on to court. \\"But he made a few mistakes and I served well to make it easy for myself.\\" In between the showers, Murray was at his ruthless best against world number 52 Pouille, playing his first ATP Masters semi-final. The 22-year-old looked nervous as he dropped serve from 40-0 in the fourth game and - after that brief rain delay - Murray broke again to clinch the set. It was a similar story in the second set, with Murray repeatedly drawing his opponent into the net and setting up the passing shot. Two more breaks of serve gave Murray the match and he left the Centrale Court in sunshine, having surpassed his best effort of reaching the last four in 2011. \\"A lot of the best players of all time have played, won and competed for the title here, so I'm very happy to get the chance to do that,\\" added Murray. \\"After 10 years of kind of struggling on the clay and especially this event maybe not playing my best, I'm happy to be there.\\" Murray completes his preparation for the French Open, which starts on 22 May, by facing world number one Djokovic in Sunday's final. The Serb, 28, needed to dig deep to beat Nishikori in the second semi-final, eventually prevailing 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-5) in a match lasting a minute over three hours. \\"Any time you get the chance to play the best players, especially right before a Slam, is great preparation,\\" said Murray, who has won just one of his past 13 matches against Djokovic. \\"Regardless of who I play in the final, I know I will be pushed hard. That's what you want.\\" Murray is bidding to win the third clay-court title of his career after finally succeeding on the surface in back-to-back tournaments last year. \\"Clay is not my most natural surface, but because of the wins I've had on it in the last few years, once I've played a few matches and had a bunch of practice sessions on it, I do start to feel much better,\\" said Murray, who reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros in 2011, 2014 and 2015. \\"I believe that I can compete with the best players on this surface now, because of the wins I've had in the last two years.\\" Williams reached her fourth Italian Open final with a 6-4 6-1 win over Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu.

Question: Given the background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  and the situation: Two teams of athletes were attending a competition. Brown team arrived in time and started their warm up, but Green team arrived late and skipped their warm up so they experienced some people getting injured.  Answer the following question: Which team experienced fewer muscle injuries? Answer:","output":"The Brown team experienced fewer muscle injuries because they arrived in time and properly performed their warm-up routine. Warming up helps increase blood flow to the muscles, increases the heart rate, and prepares muscles for physical activity, reducing the likelihood of injury.

Norovirus, which causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines, has been a recent issue on cruise ships, infecting hundreds of passengers and crew on certain voyages. Hepatitis A causes inflammation of the liver, which is treated with rest and diet changes. Parasites are tiny organisms that live inside another organism. Giardia is a parasite spread through water contaminated with the stools of people or animals who are infected. Food preparers who are infected with parasites can also contaminate food if they do not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom and before handling food.

If we strictly go by the numbers provided in the premise, it states that LSC grantees reported closing 1,038,662 million civil legal cases for the year 1999. This figure is significantly less than 10 million. However, it's important to note that there seems to be a typographical error in the data provided— \\"1,038,662 million” is an extremely large number that isn't logical in the given context. Assuming that the accurate figure is 1,038,662 (over one million cases), it still does not reach the 10 million mark stipulated in the hypothesis. Thus, we wouldn't be able to confirm or support the hypothesis that LSC grantees closed more than 10 million legal cases. We also need to consider the fact that this data is only for one year, 1999. If we were to consider the cumulative total of cases closed over multiple years, the number might potentially reach or even exceed 10 million cases.

Possible answers: surprised, fun loving, calm Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, Jan would most likely feel surprised as a result of Remy coming up behind her to scare her. Let's analyze the situation further to better understand why the other possible answers might not be as fitting. When somebody sneaks up behind another person with the intention to scare them, it usually means that the person approaching, in this case, Remy, wants to evoke an unexpected reaction, like sudden fear or a startle from the one being scared, in this case, Jan. Physiologically, this response can be attributed to the body's fight or flight reaction, affecting an individual's adrenaline levels and causing an instinctive, unforeseen reaction to a perceived threat. If we take a look at the other possible answers, we can see why they might not be as appropriate given the context: 1. Fun loving: While it is possible that Jan might consider Remy's attempt to scare her as something fun-loving or playful in retrospect, it is not the primary emotion that she is likely to feel at the moment she is being scared. Furthermore, Jan's experience of fun in this situation depends on her personality traits, the relationship she shares with Remy, and her personal preferences for such pranks or tricks. This makes \\"fun loving\\" a less certain response than the one of being surprised. 2. Calm: This emotional response might be one of the least likely in this context, as being scared usually triggers a sudden reaction, which implies that a person's calmness might be disrupted momentarily. Assuming that Jan didn't see Remy sneaking up behind her or was not anticipating this act, her composure would likely be disrupted when Remy scares her, making it difficult for her to remain calm in that specific moment. In conclusion, given the context and the nature of Remy's action, it is most reasonable to believe that Jan would feel surprised by this occurrence. Although it is possible that she might express additional or different emotions after the initial surprise based on her personality and relationship with Remy, these are more dependent on individual factors and less on the specific given context regarding Remy's attempt to scare Jan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei. Sarawak's coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban — Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers. (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities. ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony. Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore. In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803–1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei. He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit. In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier). He tried to halt the Dayaks' piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \\"morally acceptable\\" customs. His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted. His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border. Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula. In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles. More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life. He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace. Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was \\"rented\\" from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent. Dent was operating a royal charter for the British North Borneo Company — a charter similar to that of the EIC.

Donaldson was principal designer of the successful Detroit-based architectural firm Donaldson and Meier from 1880 onwards. Hypothesis: The architectural firm owned by Donaldson and Meier was very successful and was started after 1880.","output":"After reading the given paragraph, we can conclude that the hypothesis is partially true. It states that the architectural firm owned by Donaldson and Meier was very successful and was started after 1880.  Regarding the success of the architectural firm, the paragraph clearly indicates that Donaldson and Meier's Detroit-based firm was indeed successful. John M. Donaldson, an American architect and artist, was the principal designer of this successful firm. However, the information about the starting date of the firm should be amended. According to the paragraph, John M. Donaldson was the principal designer of the firm Donaldson and Meier from 1880 onwards. This means the firm was operational from 1880, not after 1880, as the hypothesis suggests.  Therefore, based on the given information, we can deduce that the architectural firm owned by Donaldson and Meier was very successful, but it started in 1880, not after that year. So, the hypothesis is partially accurate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Abstract: Successful generation of induced pluripotent stem cells entails a major metabolic switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis during the reprogramming process. The mechanism of this metabolic reprogramming, however, remains elusive. Here, our results suggest that an Atg5-independent autophagic process mediates mitochondrial clearance, a characteristic event involved in the metabolic switch. We found that blocking such autophagy, but not canonical autophagy, inhibits mitochondrial clearance, in turn, preventing iPSC induction. Furthermore, AMPK seems to be upstream of this autophagic pathway and can be targeted by small molecules to modulate mitochondrial clearance during metabolic reprogramming. Our work not only reveals that the Atg5-independent autophagy is crucial for establishing pluripotency, but it also suggests that iPSC generation and tumorigenesis share a similar metabolic switch..

Some fell to their knees, clutching the gritty stuff as though it were a long-lost child. Others lifted it to their lips to savor a taste of the home they left behind decades ago. Exiles -- who face never returning to Tibet as long as it is under Chinese rule -- stood on Tibetan soil this week, fulfilling a desire that has burned within since they fled westward across the Himalayas. Only, this week, they were able to do it in Dharamsala, the Indian hilltown that functions as the de facto capital of the refugee community. The display was the work of New York artist Tenzing Rigdol, 29, who clandestinely trucked in sacks containing 22 tons of dirt from Tibet to Dharamsala to construct his installation. He did not want to disclose details of the soil's journey, fearful of the repercussions of the act of smuggling. All he would say is that it was a \\"complicated process that took 17 months.\\" Rigdol then spread the dirt over a stage the size of a basketball court and called it \\"Our Land, Our People.\\" He invited Tibetans to walk on his dirt, write on it or pick up a microphone to express themselves. He knew it could never be the same as actually returning to Tibet, but perhaps, he thought, it would spark a sliver of that feeling. He thought of his father on Wednesday when the installation opened and people lined up, many overwhelmed with emotion. The only wish his father had was to see Tibet one more time. But he fell ill in 2007 and died. A father's unfulfilled wish drove his artist son to create something that would allow the displaced to be able to \\"return\\" home again. And others like him, who were born outside of Tibet, to finally feel native earth they have never had under their feet. \\"There are so many like my father who wanted to return,\\" Rigdol said. \\"And many more who have never been to Tibet.\\" Tenzin Dorjee, 31, remembers receiving cell phone texts at 4:30 in the morning when his excited friend first came up with his idea. The message was so long that it got broken into three. \\"He was saying he had this idea to transport a large amount of soil from Tibet,\\" Dorjee said. \\"I was blown away. My first reaction was: how is that possible?\\" But then Dorjee began visualizing the project and how much of an impact it was sure to have on Tibetan exiles. \\"The implications,\\" he said, \\"seemed historic.\\" Known as the \\"roof of the world,\\" Tibet is a remote Buddhist region governed by Communist China. Beijing claims its sovereignty over Tibet goes back centuries and views the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as a separatist. About 150,000 Tibetans live in exile, a majority of them in Dharamsala, according to their governing body. The Dalai Lama set up residence there after Chinese forces crushed a 1959 Tibetan uprising. The Dalai Lama summoned Rigdol to his residence after the opening of the installation Wednesday, Rigdol said. Rigdol carried with him some of the Tibetan dirt. Using his index finger, the Dalai Lama, wrote Tibet in the dirt and blessed the soil. Meanwhile, monks in their flowing maroon and saffron robes queued up, as did parents holding babies. \\"It was very exciting,\\" said Tenzing Geche, 22, a monk who was a baby when his family left Tibet. He touched the dirt and felt a connection like no other. \\"I felt I was back in my own country,\\" he said. Tenzing Tfuengue, 17, has never been to Tibet -- he was born and raised in India. He has longed to go to Tibet, feel the air there, drink the water, see the land that possesses his soul. \\"Today, (Rigdol) made it a little bit possible,\\" Tfuengue said. For Lhadon Tethong, 35, a Canadian visiting family in Dharamsala, the installation was bittersweet. It was completely inspiring at one moment and in another, as she watched elderly Tibetans fall to the ground, sadness overcame her. \\"I am normally better with words than this,\\" she said, unable to complete her sentence. There was no overt political statement in Rigdol's art, but some Tibetans hoped it would inspire resistance to Chinese rule. China blames Tibetan unrest on the exiled community. But no matter the consequences, Rigdol's art will carry on. The installation will stay up until Friday. But when it closes, Tibetan exiles will be allowed to take some of the dirt with them, a reminder always of the land they long to see. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

The move was made after Syria launched Scud missiles at cities near the Turkish border. In response, the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands have deployed Patriot air defense missiles to the border region to intercept any Syrian ballistic missiles.

A group of 27 U.S. troops landed in Gaziantep, Turkey, where they will survey the Patriot deployment, Turkish state news agency Anadolu said. U.S. officials did not release any information about the troops' arrival, but had said last month that forces would be deployed to Turkey. \\"We've made very clear to them that we're going to protect countries in this region,\\" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last month. \\"We have to act to do what we have to do to make sure that we defend ourselves and make sure that Turkey can defend itself.\\" The fight for a helicopter airport Meanwhile, Free Syrian Army fighters tried Friday for the third consecutive day to wrest control of a helicopter base from government forces. If successful, the assault on Taftanaz Air Base in northern Syria would shut President Bashar al-Assad's military helicopter pads and diminish his ability to launch airstrikes in the region. Opposition and government sources reported that the extremist Nusra Front, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group, was taking part in the assault on the airport.

It's unclear why the backhoe was on the track near Chester, just south of Philadelphia. The two fatalities were found on or near the backhoe, Pennsylvania Emergency Management spokeswoman Ruth Miller said. The big unanswered questions: Why did the train continue its route from New York to Savannah, Georgia, when Amtrak construction workers may have been on the track? Or why didn't the construction workers move if a train was coming? The train was carrying about 341 passengers and seven crew members when it crashed, Amtrak said. The impact caused the lead engine of the train to derail. Even before the crash, passenger Glenn Hills said he knew something was wrong. He didn't see the backhoe that lay ahead on the track. But \\"there was a lot of debris in the track, and we started driving through that,\\" the Brooklyn resident said. \\"There was a lot of gravel noise.\\" But the mess wasn't confined to the track, Hills said. \\"I looked outside, and it looked like we were in this brown cloud,\\" he said, speculating that the dustiness came from construction or high winds. \\"We were rolling into this storm, this sandstorm.\\" That's when passengers started panicking. \\"People are yelling at that point,\\" he said. \\"There was a woman screaming a prayer.\\" Then the train slammed into the backhoe. Hills said the impact didn't feel severe from the second passenger car, where he was sitting. He likened it to the feeling of a roller coaster abruptly stopping at the end of the ride -- \\"but scarier.\\" Other passengers weren't so lucky. \\"There was tremendous impact on the first car,\\" Hills said. He said the roof of that car was torn open, and several windows were broken. \\"It feels like a nightmare,\\" he said. \\"It felt like this is that experience that I've feared in the past.\\" Amtrak said it was providing limited service between Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, as the Federal Railroad Administration and National Transportation Safety Board investigate. The crash came less than a month after an Amtrak train headed from Chicago to Los Angeles It also came almost a year after -- one that left eight people dead and more than 200 injured. Sunday's crash near Philadelphia made Hills consider whether he should fly more. \\"I rely on Amtrak a lot, and I travel for my job in the Northeast Corridor a lot,\\" said Hills, who works in the specialty food industry. \\"This incident has really fed my fears.\\" But is it enough to make him stop riding trains? \\"Unfortunately, no.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation -4*f - 98 = -114 for f, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with f. To do this, we can add 98 to both sides of the equation. -4*f - 98 + 98 = -114 + 98 -4*f = -16 (We subtracted 98 from both sides to isolate the term -4*f.) Step 2: Solve for f. Now, we want to get f by itself. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -4. (-4*f) / (-4) = (-16) / (-4) f = 4 (We divided both sides by -4 to get the final solution: f = 4.)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer choices: - gloves  - skin  - shoes  - hats  - sweat  - cocoa  - Masks  - fur Answer:","output":"In addressing the question of what prevents heat loss from the body after losing hair, it is essential to understand that the main cause of heat loss in the absence of hair is through radiation and convection from the skin. Among the options provided, several of the items may assist in preventing heat loss, but the most relevant option is hats.  Hats, when designed and worn correctly, can significantly reduce heat loss after losing hair as they cover the head and provide insulation against cold temperatures. In this context, hats play the most crucial role in preventing heat loss from the body in the absence of hair. Here is a brief overview of the other options and their relevance to preventing heat loss after losing hair: - Gloves: Gloves help keep the hands warm, particularly when exposed to cold weather, but they don't contribute directly to reducing heat loss from the head. Therefore, they are not the primary solution for heat loss prevention in the absence of hair. - Skin: As the outermost layer covering the body, the skin plays a major role in heat regulation. It releases sweat to cool down the body and constricts blood vessels close to the surface to minimize temperature loss. However, in the case of hair loss, the skin alone may not be very effective in preventing heat loss due to its natural mechanisms. - Shoes: Similar to gloves, shoes help keep the feet warm, but they have no direct impact on preventing heat loss from the head, making them an unsuitable solution for this specific question. - Sweat: Sweat is a natural cooling mechanism that aids the skin in maintaining optimal body temperature. It works by evaporating from the skin's surface and absorbing heat. In the case of hair loss, sweat does not prevent heat loss; its role is to regulate body temperature. - Cocoa: While cocoa may provide a temporary sense of warmth when consumed, it does not have any direct impact on preventing heat loss from the body or head. Its role is more in promoting brief internal warmth. - Masks: Masks are designed to cover the mouth and nose, primarily as a protective barrier against infections or air pollution. They provide limited insulation, having minimal impact on preventing heat loss from the body or head. - Fur: Fur is an insulating material found on many animals, providing warmth, and protection from cold environments. Synthetic fur found in clothing and accessories serves a similar purpose. However, as fur is present on animals and not humans, it isn't the option in addressing heat loss in hairless individuals. In conclusion, amongst the given options, hats are the most appropriate choice for preventing heat loss from the body after losing hair. They specifically target the head area and provide necessary insulation to minimize heat loss through radiation and convection. Other items, such as gloves, shoes, and masks, play a role in overall body temperature regulation and insulation but do not directly impact heat loss from the head."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two days later, he wrote again: \\"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \\"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\\". Consequently, he was baptised \\"Albert Frederick Arthur George\\" at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth.

Article: Having a vaguely-defined goal can make it difficult to follow through on your efforts and track your progress. However, having a clear, well-defined goal will help you stay driven and know how far you've come.  Your goal should be as clear and actionable as possible. Remember to focus on either a process goal or an outcome goal. Keep in mind, though, that you can work toward multiple goals at once. For instance, you might have an outcome goal of getting an “A” in English, and process goals along the way that help you earn that “A.” For example, instead of just saying your goal is to get through your math class, figure out what you hope to accomplish. Do you want to become more proficient in math (a process goal), or earn a good grade (an outcome goal)? Whenever you set a goal for yourself, it's important to recognize how you've progressed in working towards it. That's why you should always set goals with clear, measurable progress marks and keep track of your efforts every step of the way.  Determine in advance how you will measure success. Ask yourself, \\"How will I know when I've accomplished my goal?\\" You can mark off successes when you reach checkpoints along the way. You can even use a reward system. Choose both short-term and long-term measures of success. For example, you might measure success in the short-term by looking at how much studying and homework you get done in a week, and in the long-term by watching how your grades improve over the course of the semester. Even a good, well-defined goal could be difficult to achieve without a clear action plan. When you set your goal, make sure you include action-oriented steps as part of your goal development. That way you'll know what you're trying to accomplish and, more importantly, how you'll get there.  Be very clear in how you intend to achieve your goal. Having action-oriented steps means developing clear guidelines that lay out what (specifically) you will need to do at every step along the way. Think about the steps your goal will require, both in the short-term and in the long-term. Focus on what specifically you will need to do. For example, action-oriented steps might include completing your homework ahead of time, reviewing your notes every day after class, and arranging a meeting with your instructor. It's important to dream big, but it's also important to know what you can realistically accomplish with the materials you currently possess and the time frame you're given. Don't bite off more than you can chew, but at the same time don't give yourself a task that's too easy.  An example of a realistic goal would be to improve your course grade by one letter before the end of the semester. An unrealistic goal, by comparison, would be to turn an F into an A by the end of the semester. Be aware of what could potentially hinder your success and plan accordingly so that these obstacles do not impede your progress towards accomplishing your goal. For instance, if your goal is to get a good grade on an essay, you’ll want to be aware of other assignments that could affect the amount of time you spend working on the essay. If you're working within a school calendar, the end of that semester might be the end of your time frame. However, there's still plenty of flexibility in terms of what can be done and when it needs to be done by.  Decide in advance when your goal needs to be accomplished. Once you have a firm deadline, work your way backwards to determine when you need to begin your work and when various milestones along the way must be met. For example, if you're working within the time frame of a semester, you might decide that you'll accomplish your goal before finals week. That means working backwards to figure out what needs to be completed and when. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of setting clear, well-defined goals, distinguishing between process and outcome goals, and having a realistic action plan to achieve them.

Write highlights for this article: The man who rescued an 11-year-old girl lost in a dense Florida swamp said Wednesday that God led him directly to her and that finding her was no surprise. James King said he set out on his own to look for Nadia Bloom on Tuesday, trusting that he was going in the right direction even when that meant through water or dense brush. \\"I was expecting to hear her voice,\\" King told CNN. \\"So I'm yelling, 'Nadia!' and at one point, I yell, 'Nadia!' and I hear 'What?' And I said that way -- right there.\\" Tanya Bloom, Nadia's mother, said later Wednesday that the family is \\"so fortunate God used him to bring her back.\\" \\"She's doing remarkably well,\\" Bloom said. \\"She has swollen feet and lots of bug bites and scratches, but she's doing great.\\" Dr. Mary Farrell, who treated the girl when she arrived at the hospital, said that Nadia was in good shape but that she would remain hospitalized a little longer because of a bacterial infection. \\"When she got here, she was a little bit dehydrated but she had been resuscitated pretty well,\\" Farrell said, \\"and she looked remarkably well considering she had been out for four and half days.\\" King said he was surprised at the good shape Nadia was in. She had been missing since Friday. Shoeless and covered in insect bites, she was in otherwise good condition, he said. \\"She was not panicked. She looked like she had been sitting there, waiting on me,\\" he said. The two of them then stayed in the swamp, near Lake Jesup in central Florida, while King called authorities. When he got hold of the 911 dispatcher, he put Nadia on the phone. \\"Hi. This is Nadia. I'm the girl who got lost,\\" came the little girl's voice. King said it took him \\"two hours of rough time\\" trekking through the swamp to find Nadia. He said he figures it took Nadia just as long to reach the same spot. She told King that she had gone on a nature walk and simply got lost. \\"We are so, so grateful,\\" Nadia's father, Jeff Bloom, said. \\"I can't even express how we felt when she was found -- beyond words.\\" The swamp was so dense, King said, that the rescuers who carried Nadia out on a black cloth stretcher Tuesday had to use machetes to cut through the brush, bushes and trees. \\"I see it as an answer to a lot of people's prayers,\\" King told CNN. \\"I'm just very thankful, I'm thankful that God used me as a part of it to be able to find her. It's definitely a miracle. \\"I didn't know where she was. The only person who knew where she was was God, and I asked him and he led me directly to her, straight -- well, as straight as you can go through the swamp.\\" King said he prayed the whole time he was searching, even when it seemed like he was going in the wrong direction. In one case, he said, there was water all around and he didn't know where to go. \\"He said, 'Go that way.' And I'm looking at water. I said, 'Lord, are you sure?' He said. 'I got ya.' And as soon as I start walking, the ground under the water is solid. It's only about a foot and a half deep. He took care of me all the way there.\\" The disappearance of Nadia, described as mildly autistic, had sparked an Amber Alert that was canceled when King found her. Both King and Nadia's family at one time attended the same church, Metro Church in Winter Springs, Florida, but they didn't know one another -- though King said Nadia did seem to register him as a friendly face when she was found. The church held an open-air thanksgiving service to celebrate Nadia's return Tuesday evening. \\"Give the glory to God,\\" Nadia's father told reporters after seeing his daughter Tuesday. King had brought trail mix and drinks to give to Nadia if he found her, but he also brought another important item -- toilet paper. The swamp vegetation was so thick that the helicopter that came to retrieve Nadia and King couldn't see them on the ground. King said he heard the chopper overhead and tried to give the dispatcher directions for the pilot, but it still didn't work. \\"I had brought toilet paper for signaling, and so I covered the top of a couple of bushes that were in more of an open area than I was in,\\" King told CNN. \\"They still had a hard time finding me, but I used that on the top (of the bushes) and they finally were able to locate it.\\" Authorities questioned King after they got to safety, something King said was unexpected but understandable, especially given his ability to find Nadia so quickly. \\"They also have a job to do,\\" he said. \\"They have a responsibility to the community to make sure there is no foul play. And so I understand that, I understood it completely.\\" Coming out of the swamp was a blur with lots of hugs and praise, King said. He said he hopes to be able to see the Bloom family again, and that Nadia even hinted he'd be welcome: \\"She said she might invite me to her pizza party.\\"","output":"In the dense Florida swamp, 11-year-old Nadia Bloom was found and rescued by James King, who claimed that he was led by God to locate the girl. King had set out on his search for Nadia, who had been missing since Friday, trusting that he was heading in the right direction — eventually leading him to find the girl. Nadia's family expressed their gratitude, with her mother stating that they are \\"so fortunate God used him to bring her back.\\" Nadia was found to be in relatively good condition, with swollen feet, bug bites, and scratches as her main injuries. King's search took him through two hours of difficult terrain within the swamp, while Nadia disclosed that she had simply gotten lost during a nature walk, leading her to the spot where she was found. The rescue of Nadia from the swamp involved the use of machetes to cut through the heavy brush and vegetation, as the area where she was located was incredibly dense. The Amber Alert for Nadia's disappearance was canceled following her return. Both King and Nadia's family attended the same church at some point but did not know each other. The church held a thanksgiving service to celebrate her safe return, and King was questioned by authorities after the incident. He expressed understanding towards the inquiries, acknowledging the responsibility of the officials to ensure that there was no foul play involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Enormous super typhoon Neoguri lashing Okinawa and targeting Japan Satellite image of Neoguri (NOAA) The first super typhoon of 2014 is currently battering Okinawa and is on a collision course with southwest Japan. Named Neoguri – meaning “raccoon” in Korean – the potentially destructive storm has peak winds of 150 mph. In recent hours, the storm has weakened modestly due to both a structural re-organization known as an eyewall replacement cycle and some dry air wrapping into its center. But the sprawling cyclone is forecast by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to re-intensify, with maximum sustained winds reaching as high as 160 mph in about 24 hours. Should it achieve this intensity, it would match the strongest storm on the planet so far in 2014 (tropical cyclone Gillian, from the Australia cyclone region). WeatherBell Analytics meteorologist Ryan Maue, calling Neoguri a “run-of-the-mill super typhoon”, is skeptical it will attain such extreme intensity. “Its [large] size is working against it,” Maue said. “I’m not buying the eyewall replacement cycle bringing it back to life.” JTWC convinced eyewall replacement cycle will lead to re-intensification #Neoguri. I’m skeptical w/so much dry air. pic.twitter.com/OkxXDUoJ31 — Ryan N. Maue (@RyanMaue) July 7, 2014 Irrespective of short-term increases or decreases in strength, the storm should begin to steadily weaken in 36 hours as it moves into cooler water and makes landfall in southwest Japan. For the moment, the storm is buffeting Okinawa and surrounding islands. The Stars and Stripes blog reports: “Actual winds between 40 and 56 mph are occurring.” American storm chaser Josh Morgerman is positioned on the tiny Japan island of Kumejima about 90 kilometers west of Okinawa, where he reports deteriorating conditions: Howling, rattling windows, near-hurricane gusts lash Miyako-jima as #TyphoonNeoguri closes in. 979.7 mb. #iCyclone pic.twitter.com/NCFw2Xz2J6 — Josh Morgerman (@HurricaneJosh) July 7, 2014 Links: Radar views of typhoon: Miyakojima | Okinawa This region – known as the Miyako Islands – is predicted to experience the worst of the super typhoon. Reports Mashable’s Andrew Freedman: Japan has issued its highest weather alert for these islands, anticipating major damage. Specifically, the JMA issued its first-ever “emergency weather warning” for Miyakojima Chiho, which is expected to be close enough to the storm to experience its eyewall, where the worst winds and highest waves will be located. Waves of 45 to 50 feet in height may hit the Miyako Islands, with similar wave heights possible in Okinawa, depending on the storm’s exact path. JMA has issued Emergency Warnings for Okinawa and Typhoon Warnings for the lower Ryukyus. #Neoguri pic.twitter.com/cMYtNTpehy — Anthony Sagliani (@anthonywx) July 7, 2014 Landfall in southwest mainland Japan should occur around July 9 local time. “Though it will weaken by then, winds could still be over 100 mph by the time it reaches the main islands of Kyushu, Shikoku and western portions of Honshu, home to tens of millions of people,” predicts The Weather Channel. Jeff Masters of Weather Underground expects significant flooding when the storm comes ashore: Nagasaki had upwards of 8 inches of rain on Thursday, and parts of Kyushu saw 10 inches of rain on Friday, thanks to a stalled stationary front over the island. With the soils already saturated from these heavy rains, the torrential rains from Neoguri are sure to cause major flooding on Wednesday and Thursday. Much of Japan is likely to be impacted, as the projected track carries the storm right through its heart. While areas in southwest Japan like Sasebo bear the brunt of the storm, torrential rain and strong winds will blast through the country, including Kyoto and Tokyo. Neoguri track forecast (Joint Typhoon Warning Center) Neoguri is the third typhoon of 2014 in the West Pacific. Summary:","output":"A super typhoon named Neoguri is hitting Okinawa and is heading towards southwest Japan. Neoguri is a very strong storm with winds of 150 miles per hour. The storm might get weaker, but it can also become stronger with winds up to 160 miles per hour. The storm is expected to slowly weaken as it moves into cooler water and then makes landfall in southwest Japan. Japan has issued its highest weather alert, and they expect big waves and strong winds in some areas. The typhoon will likely cause a lot of rain and flooding in many parts of Japan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute at the age of five? ?  Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.  In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. Before you decide to confront your neighbors about their noise levels, you should try your best to assess their situation, particularly if this noise problem is a new issue. Consider the following sorts of questions, the answers to which might affect whether you decide to talk to them or how you decide to talk to them:  Do they have a new baby? If they do, they are surely aware that their infant is wailing and are trying to calm him or her. Indeed, they are most likely more stressed out about the baby's crying than you are. Consider giving it a little bit of time to let the new parents and baby settle into a routine before you decide to talk to them. Do they work nights? If so, there may be no way around them making noise while getting ready for work (showering, going down the stairs, starting their car, etc.) or coming home from their shift. Of course, if they are excessively loud (blasting music while they shower, for example), you may want to talk to them. On the other hand, if the noises they are making are what you would reasonably expect from anyone getting ready for their day, you won't have much of a case. Is their pet a new adoption who hasn't yet had time to adapt to its new home? If so, your neighbors and their pet may just be going through an adjustment period. You may want to consider waiting for a while to see if they manage to get their new pet settled and find strategies for dealing with its noise. You are aiming for the best possible outcome, where your neighbor is receptive and sympathetic to your complaint. Thus, choosing the appropriate time and place to talk things over with them is important.  Ideally, you will be able to talk to your neighbor when they are not being noisy or disruptive, especially if the problem occurs in the middle of the night (when no one is at their best) or if you are angry while the noise is going on. Try to pick a time when you are rested and calm, and also when you have reason to believe that your neighbor is similarly rested and won't feel ambushed. Of course, if the noise is unbearable, you may not be able to wait, in which case we give you advice on how to confront them at these times in subsequent steps. In order to avoid putting your neighbor on the defensive, you should try not to surprise them at an inopportune time or place. It's best to avoid confrontations when it's clear that your neighbor is not prepared for a discussion, and it's even better if you can alert them to your need to talk and arrange for a time that works for both of you.  For example, it's not a good time to confront when your neighbor when she has just gotten home a twelve hour shift, or when she is clearly struggling to get all her kids off to school. Rather than demanding that she give you her attention right then and there, you can try something like the following, after you see that she's got everyone buckled in: “Hey Kathy, I see that you're busy right now, but are you free for a short chat later this afternoon? I'd like to talk about some noise issues that I'm sure we'll be able to work out together.” There may come a time when you have to become more assertive if your neighbors do nothing to reduce their noise, but you don't want to be hostile when you confront them initially. Your neighbors are far more likely to be receptive if you approach them politely and calmly.  Instead of banging on their door angrily, or having the first words out of your mouth be “Your d*% kids have been keeping me up all night!”, try easing into the conversation by asking them how everything has been going for them lately. If there is any way for you to compliment them or generally find a way to demonstrate your friendliness and willingness to work with them, then do so. For example, you may be there to talk to them about how their new dog barks while they are out of the house. So long as you aren't allergic and the dog is otherwise well-behaved, give the pup a good pet and compliment the owners on how beautiful she is. You can then lead into your issue: “Spot is gorgeous and clearly attached to you already. I think that may be related to why I'm here: you may not know it, but when you're out of the house, Spot barks and cries almost continually. I think this may be because she's dealing with separation anxiety. I was hoping we could come up with a plan to address that today.” If you can find ways to make your neighbor be sympathetic towards you, it is more likely that they will take your complaints seriously and commit to reducing their noise levels for your benefit.  Once you've explained to your neighbor what activity or behavior of theirs is disturbing you, make sure that you clearly explain how it is negatively affecting you. Demonstrate to them that your problem isn't with them, but that it is with the noise and how it is interfering with your life. For example, if their music is keeping you up at night, try the following: “Chris, you clearly have excellent taste in music—I'd like to get that playlist from you if I can—but the walls between our apartment are pretty thin, and I've been having a really hard time getting to sleep because of it. I've got to get up early for work, so this is becoming an issue.” Rather than just demanding that your neighbors shut up or stop making noise altogether, it will help if you are prepared with a plan. Be sure to let your neighbor know how you would like the situation to be resolved. Try to offer a reasonable plan that acknowledges your neighbor's right to live their own life in their own home.  For example, if your issue is that your neighbor's dog has been barking while they are out, you can suggest that they crate the dog at certain times or place it in a different room in the house when they are out.  You could also suggest that they shut their blinds and curtains and leave the television or radio on when they are out (which can reduce the dog's distractions and thus hopefully its barking). If your neighbor's music has been keeping you up, rather than just demanding that they turn it off, you could try the following suggestion: “Given that I try to be asleep by 10pm would you be willing to turn the music off or switch to using headphones by then?” Summary:","output":"Before confronting neighbors about noise issues, assess their situation, consider the timing and approach them calmly and politely, offering reasonable solutions to achieve a peaceful resolution."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Rap mogul Suge Knight to surrender in connection with deadly hit-and-run, lawyer says Jan. 29, 2015: A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigator photographs the scene of an accident at a parking lot in Compton, Calif. A lawyer for Marion 'Suge' Knight, a Death Row Records founder, says Knight was driving a car involved in an accident. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) An attorney for rap mogul Marion \\"Suge\\" Knight says he is working with Los Angeles County sheriff's officials to have Knight surrender for questioning in connection with a deadly hit-and-run Thursday. MyFoxLA, citing attorney James Blatt, reported that Knight was at the wheel of a car that struck two men shortly before 3 p.m. local time in Compton. One of the men died, while the other was taken to a hospital. The injured man's condition was not immediately available and neither man's name was released. The Los Angeles Times reported that the tragedy stemmed from an altercation that occurred on the set of the forthcoming film \\"Straight Outta Compton,\\" a biopic about the rap group NWA. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Capt. John Corina said that the two men Knight argued with went to a nearby restaurant about 20 minutes after the confrontation Corina alleged Knight followed the men there in a red truck and ran them over in the parking lot. Witnesses told the paper the truck hit the men, then backed over them before fleeing the scene. The incident is being investigated as a homicide. Blatt claimed to the Associated Press that Knight was trying to escape from a pair of attackers and said he was confident that his client will be cleared of wrongdoing. Knight co-founded Death Row Records with Dr. Dre in 1991 and built it into the first successful mainstream rap label behind acts like NWA, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur. Knight was at the wheel of the BMW Shakur was riding in when he was shot and killed following a boxing match in Las Vegas. Knight has had repeated brushes with the law. In 1997, he was sentenced to nine years in prison for violating the terms of his probation in an earlier assault case. He was released in 2001. In 2008, he was arrested in Las Vegas on suspicion of drug possession and aggravated assault and pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery the following year. He is currently waiting trial alongside comedian Katt Williams on charges of second degree robbery in connection with the theft of a photographer's camera.

Conservatives attack Supreme Court Nominee Sonia Sotomayor's background ON PAPER, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor resembles one of her would-be colleagues on the high court: Princeton undergrad, Yale Law School, an editor on the Yale Law Journal, experience as a prosecutor and years of service on the federal bench. Yet Judge Sotomayor, President Obama's pick to replace retiring Justice David H. Souter, is not being compared by some conservatives to Princeton/Yale alum Samuel A. Alito Jr., widely acclaimed as smart and qualified when he was nominated. Instead, they are trying to peg her as \\"President Obama's Harriet Miers,\\" after the nominee of President George W. Bush who took herself out of contention as conservatives savaged her reputation and raised doubts about whether she was smart enough for the job. Why is that? After all, Judge Sotomayor boasts the very qualifications that these conservatives claimed Ms. Miers lacked. Ms. Miers was in part lambasted by conservatives -- unfairly, we noted at the time -- because she did not meet the now-cliched criteria of graduation from elite schools and experience as a judge. Judge Sotomayor's educational pedigree is top-notch, and she served six years on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York before spending the past 11 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Ms. Miers, conservative critics complained, lacked a substantial paper trail, leading some to worry about whether she was more liberal than her record let on. Judge Sotomayor can't be tagged as a stealth candidate, given her two-decade track record of opinions on topics as varied as immigration, eminent domain, corporate law and the First Amendment. Because it is difficult to dismiss her academic credentials and her professional experience, some on the right have resorted to the politics of personal destruction. Curt Levey of the Committee for Justice said in a radio interview that Judge Sotomayor was picked because \\"she's a woman and Hispanic, not because she was the best qualified.\\" Former congressman Tom Tancredo sank to even greater depths when he called Judge Sotomayor a \\"racist\\" for her past affiliation with the Hispanic advocacy group, the National Council of La Raza; Mr. Tancredo called La Raza \\"a Latino KKK without the hoods or the nooses.\\" Former Bush adviser Karl Rove implicitly questioned Judge Sotomayor's intelligence, saying in an interview with PBS host Charlie Rose that \\"I know lots of stupid people who went to Ivy League schools.\\" No doubt, but would Mr. Rove have said the same thing in connection with Justice Alito? There are plenty of lines of inquiry that should be explored to better discern Judge Sotomayor's qualifications and judicial philosophy. We look forward to a vigorous debate about Judge Sotomayor's more controversial and consequential cases. We would like to hear more from Judge Sotomayor on how gender and ethnicity might help -- as she put it -- a \\"wise Latina\\" judge come to a \\"better\\" conclusion in some cases than a white, male jurist. (The president recently said Judge Sotomayor regretted her choice of words.) Above all, we'd welcome a confirmation process that sets aside rancid stereotypes and sexist assumptions in order to explore the record and philosophy of a woman whose work could affect the country for some time to come. Do you have a different view of this issue? Debate a member of the editorial board today in the Editorial Judgment discussion group. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the conservative attacks on Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor's background. Despite her impressive qualifications, such as being a Princeton undergraduate, Yale Law School graduate, and having experience as a prosecutor and a federal judge, some conservatives are attempting to compare her to the failed nominee Harriet Miers. Critics argue that Sotomayor was chosen because of her gender and ethnicity, rather than her qualifications. The article condemns these personal attacks and highlights the importance of a thorough confirmation process that focuses on Judge Sotomayor's qualifications and judicial philosophy, rather than on unfair and baseless comparisons or stereotypes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Towards the end of the war as the role of strategic bombing became more important, a new command for the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific was created to oversee all U.S. strategic bombing in the hemisphere, under United States Army Air Forces General Curtis LeMay. Japanese industrial production plunged as nearly half of the built-up areas of 67 cities were destroyed by B-29 firebombing raids. On 9–10 March 1945 alone, about 100,000 people were killed in a conflagration caused by an incendiary attack on Tokyo. LeMay also oversaw Operation Starvation, in which the inland waterways of Japan were extensively mined by air, which disrupted the small amount of remaining Japanese coastal sea traffic.

Context: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Question: Who is the hairdresser? Options:  A. The narrator's mother  B.

Article: A plush penthouse in one of New York's most expensive buildings is headed to foreclosure, signaling new troubles for the high-end real-estate market.            The 6,200-square-foot, full-floor unit at One57 is scheduled to go to foreclosure auction next month, according to Bloomberg.      The apartment, known as Apartment 79, sold in 2014 for just under 51 million. The identity of the buyer is unknown because it was purchased through an anonymous limited liability corporation called One57 79 Inc. The LLC took out a loan from Luxembourg-based Banque Havilland in 2015. When the borrower defaulted, the bank forced a sale.            When it opened in 2014, One57 was the shining symbol of a new class of luxury super-towers in Manhattan. Rising to over 1,000 feet, apartments were selling for nearly 7,000 a square foot, largely to overseas buyers. Billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman and other partners bought the biggest penthouse for just about 90 million.            Yet starting last year, an oversupply of luxury towers and a scarcity of overseas buyers have hurt the top of the market. New development sales fell 25 percent in the latest quarter and units at One57 are selling for discounts of more than 20 percent.            The 51 million apartment is scheduled to head to auction on July 19. Another apartment that sold for 21 million at One57 went to foreclosure auction earlier this month, but there's no word yet on the result. ||||| Billionaire’s Row is headed toward Skid Row now that a second luxury condo at 157 W. 57th St. is slated to be sold in a foreclosure auction.      The building, known as One 57, is home to the city’s only 100 million condo. It was the city’s tallest residential building for a short time until nearby 432 Park Ave. was completed.      The latest unit in the building to hit foreclosure is a full-floor penthouse bought for 50.9 million in 2014 by a mystery buyer who hid the purchase behind an LLC, One57 79 Inc., according to PropertyShark.      The foreclosure auction was first reported by Bloomberg.      It could be the city’s most expensive residential foreclosure ever.      The buyer took out a 35.3 million mortgage from a Luxembourg bank, Banque Havilland SA, in 2015 and never repaid the loan, so the bank is forcing a sale.      Last month, The Post reported that a 56th-floor unit at One57 was also slated for a foreclosure auction.      Around 30 residential properties in Manhattan have been scheduled to go to foreclosure auction for the first time during the first quarter of 2017, PropertyShark’s Nancy Jorisch told The Post.      One57, created by Extell Development’s Gary Barnett, was funded by a subsidiary of an Abu Dhabi company linked to a multibillion-dollar global money-laundering investigation, The Post revealed last year. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A luxury penthouse apartment at One57, one of New York's most expensive apartment buildings, is due for foreclosure next month.

But first the movie, it's a typical TV movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with William Holden. What they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the movie up to 1966? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement? As for the casting, some hits some misses. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes. He's believable as an ex-BMOC jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him (pardon the pun). Gretchen Moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played. She didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But then again Holden was ten years too old. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from \\"The Taming of The Shrew\\".

Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Lord Mayor of London is the City of London's mayor and leader of the City of London Corporation. Within the City, the Lord Mayor is accorded precedence over all individuals except the sovereign and retains various traditional powers, rights and privileges, including the title and style The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of London.  - Kingsland Road is the name of a road, part of the A10, in the London Borough of Hackney in England. It runs from the junction with Old Street and Hackney Road (the section of the A10 south of this is Shoreditch High Street) north to the junction with Balls Pond Road and Dalston Lane, where it changes its name to Kingsland High Street. Kingsland Road means the road \\"to\\" Kingsland, an old settlement that has been absorbed by modern Dalston. It is one of the oldest roads in England and is thought to follow the route of the Roman Ermine Street, later known as the Old North Road.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - Ermine Street is the name of a major Roman road in England that ran from London (\\"Londinium\\") to Lincoln (\\"Lindum Colonia\\") and York (\\"Eboracum\\"). The Old English name was \\"Earninga Straete\\" (1012), named after a tribe called the \\"Earningas\\", who inhabited a district later known as \\"Armingford Hundred\\", around Arrington, Cambridgeshire and Royston, Hertfordshire. \\"Armingford\\", and \\"Arrington\\" share the same Old English origin. The original Roman name for the route is unknown. It is also known as the Old North Road from London to where it joins the A1 Great North Road near Godmanchester.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Old Street is a street in central and east London that runs west to east from Goswell Road in Clerkenwell, in the London Borough of Islington, to the crossroads where it meets Shoreditch High Street (south), Kingsland Road (north) and Hackney Road (east) in Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney.  - Shoreditch High Street is the old main street of Shoreditch, London. It is part of the A10 road and connects Norton Folgate to the south with Kingsland Road to the north. It constitutes a segment of the Roman Ermine Street, which ran directly north from London to Lincoln and York. The parish church of St Leonard's, Shoreditch is situated at the north-east end of the road at the crossroads where it meets with Hackney Road. This part of the road is wholly within the London Borough of Hackney; below Boundary Street, the eastern side lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The high street enters the City of London at Norton Folgate.   - An almshouse is charitable housing provided to enable people (typically elderly people who can no longer work to earn enough to pay rent) to live in a particular community. They are often targeted at the poor of a locality, at those from certain forms of previous employment, or their widows, and are generally maintained by a charity or the trustees of a bequest.  - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.  - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region.  - Dalston is a district of the London Borough of Hackney in North East London, England. Dalston began as a hamlet within the parish of Hackney, which developed on either side of Dalston Lane. As the area urbanised, the term came to apply to surrounding areas including the old centres of Kingsland and Shacklewell, which are now considered part of Dalston.  - Hackney Road is a London arterial route running from Shoreditch Church to Cambridge Heath in the London Borough of Hackney. The route runs between the areas of Bethnal Green and Haggerston. It lies close to the border between the boroughs of London Boroughs of Hackney and Tower Hamlets.   - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around  43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.  - Central London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government.   - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.

First question: Why didn't the British invade Nepal during the British Raj in India? Second question: Why was Nepal not colonized by the British, like they did to India? Are these two questions asking the same thing?  a). no;  b). yes;","output":"b). yes; Both questions revolve around the core theme of British not colonizing or invading Nepal during the British Raj in India, and they delve into the factors that contributed to this historical outcome. To address the questions, it is important to explore the reasons why Nepal was not colonized by the British. 1. Geographical barriers: Nepal is surrounded by massive mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, making the terrain difficult to maneuver through. This proved to be a large obstacle for the British to invade and successfully conquer the region. 2. Gurkha warriors: The Nepalese Gurkha soldiers were exceptionally skilled and fierce fighters. The British experienced first-hand their prowess during the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-1816). The British recognized their military strengths, and, instead of invading or subjugating Nepal, formed an alliance that allowed them to recruit Gurkha soldiers into the British army. 3. Treaty of Sugauli (1816): Following the Anglo-Nepalese War, the British and Nepalese signed the Treaty of Sugauli. This treaty provided the British with control over specific territories and a resolution to the conflict between the nations. It created an environment based on mutual respect and a buffer between British India and China, which the British valued. 4. Benefits of a buffer state: As mentioned earlier, the British valued Nepal as a buffer state between their Indian territory and China. Nepal also acted as a barrier against potential Russian influence. There was strategic value in maintaining a friendly relationship with Nepal rather than conquering and incorporating it into the British Empire. 5. Political and diplomatic considerations: The British had their hands full managing the rest of their Indian territory. The administration recognized that the costs and risks associated with the military conquest and governance of Nepal might not outweigh the benefits of colonization. Due to these factors, they chose to preserve diplomatic ties and avoid direct rule. Both questions are essentially examining the same subject, the reasons behind British not colonizing or invading Nepal, but from slightly different angles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ryan didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast. (B). Jason didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast.","output":"Ryan had more energy than Jason because (B) Jason didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast. A healthy breakfast is essential for providing the body with the necessary nutrients and fuel it needs to kick start the day. It not only replenishes our energy reserves after a long night of sleep, but also helps in maintaining physical and mental well-being throughout the day. In the case of Ryan and Jason, their contrasting levels of energy can be explained by their differing morning routines, specifically, the importance placed on having a nutritious breakfast. Jason, who didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast, most likely found himself feeling sluggish and low in energy as the day progressed. Breakfast helps in regulating blood sugar levels, and by skipping it, Jason may have experienced energy crashes and mood swings. Moreover, the lack of a balanced breakfast could have caused him to feel hungry later in the day, leading to a higher likelihood of making unhealthy food choices for a quick energy boost, such as consuming high-sugar or high-fat snacks. On the other hand, Ryan ensured that he started his day with a healthy breakfast, which helped him feel satisfied and energized throughout the day. His meal would have contained a good balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats, along with vitamins and minerals that support proper functioning of the body and brain. For instance, complex carbohydrates provide a steady release of energy, proteins help in building and repairing tissues, and healthy fats support brain function and cell growth. As a result of taking the time to prioritize and consume a wholesome breakfast, Ryan was able to better focus on his daily tasks, be more productive, and maintain a positive mood. Moreover, by having the energy to remain physically active, Ryan could engage in physical activities which further boosted his overall well-being. In conclusion, the difference in energy levels between Ryan and Jason can be attributed to their contrasting approaches to breakfast time. While Ryan paid attention to the significance of a proper and nutritious meal, Jason neglected this crucial aspect of a healthy lifestyle. Eating a balanced breakfast has a direct impact on energy levels, mental focus, and mood – attributes which made all the difference between Ryan and Jason's performance throughout the day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

The table is like a list which shows the best team on the top and the other teams below them. One day, the Crusaders had a soccer game against another team called Ballymena United, which was led by their coach, David Jeffrey. He is like the teacher of the team who helps them learn how to play better soccer. The Crusaders and Ballymena United were both excited to play and see who would win. Before this game, the Crusaders had more points than any other team in the league - they were five points ahead of the next best team. If you think of these points like stars you put on a chart, the Crusaders had five more stars than the team below them. But in this game, the Crusaders and Ballymena United played very hard and tried their best to score goals. When you kick the ball into the net, you get a point called a goal. However, after all their efforts, no one could score a goal! At the end of the game, the score was 0-0, which means that both teams had zero goals. It was a tie! Now, because the Crusaders tied with Ballymena United, their lead on the big table became smaller. The team below them got closer, and now they are only five points away from the top spot, instead of more points. Everyone is excited to see who will win the next games and if the Crusaders can stay at the top of the table. Ballymena United and their coach, David Jeffrey, are also proud because they played really well against a strong team like the Crusaders.

Question: What does Henry instruct t.k. to do when Sajani arrives? Title: Before the Rains Movie plot: Before the Rains is set in 1930s Malabar District of the Madras Presidency of British India, against the backdrop of a growing nationalist movement. An idealistic young Indian man, T.K. Neelan (Rahul Bose) finds himself torn between his ambitions for the future and his loyalty to tradition when people in his village learn of an affair between his British boss and close friend Henry Moores (Linus Roache) and a married village woman Sajani (Nandita Das). Henry and T.K. are working on constructing a road in rural Kerala. The start of the film focuses on the affair between Henry and his house-maid Sajani. They make love near a waterfall, witnessed by two children who flee. Both Henry and Sajani are married to different partners and both know of each other's marriages. Henry's wife Laura and son Peter return from their vacation in England. Sajani is distraught but Henry assures Sajani that she is the one he loves. Sajani's violent husband finds out about her infidelity and brutally beats her. Sajani flees to Henry's house; Henry instructs T.K. to take her away into hiding. T.K tells Sajani never to come back as she is now disgraced and her presence in the village will endanger Henry's life. Sajani does not believe T.K but leaves nonetheless. During this time, resentment towards the British grows stronger; news about an adulterous act between an Indian woman and a British man would be inflammatory. Sajani's love for Henry drives her back to Henry's house. Henry tells her to leave and admits that he does not love her. A distraught Sajani finds T.K's handgun (a gift from Henry), shoots herself in the chest and dies. T.K. and Henry throw her body in the river to conceal her death. Sajani's disappearance garners interest in the village. Sajani's brother Manas and husband gather the men of the village to search the jungle for her. The same two children who discovered Sajani and Henry near the waterfall in compromising position then discover her dead body. It is established that a bullet from an English pistol killed...

Options: - vaporate - cool off - form crystals - melt - keep things cold  The answer is \\"melt\\" because A:","output":"If ice is not ice anymore, it has undergone a phase change from a solid state to another state, typically liquid or gas. The answer is \\"melt\\" because: A: When ice absorbs heat, the molecules' kinetic energy increases, causing them to move faster and farther apart from one another. This results in the transition from a solid (ice) to a liquid (water) state, a process that is referred to as \\"melting.\\" The other options provided do not accurately describe what happens to ice when it is no longer in a solid state: 1. Vaporate: The term \\"vaporate\\" may be a misspelling of \\"evaporate,\\" which is a process in which a substance changes from a liquid to a gas state. Evaporation occurs with water, not ice. For ice to evaporate, it first needs to melt into water. 2. Cool off: \\"Cool off\\" implies the removal of heat, which would maintain ice's solid state or even make it colder, not change it into something other than ice. 3. Form crystals: Ice itself is a crystalline solid, so forming crystals is not a process that changes ice into a different state.  4. Keep things cold: This is an action that can be performed using ice – not a process that happens to the ice itself which causes it to become something other than ice. Therefore, among the given options, \\"melt\\" is the most appropriate answer to describe the process where ice changes and is no longer ice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization\\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes  are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods. Options: A Ancient people did a great deal of physical exercise. B People today have a lot of alcohol. C People today have more tobacco. D Food is quite different between life today and life in ancient times. Answer: D Food is quite different between life today and life in ancient times.

Pro-Brexit ministers face Cameron ultimatum The prime minister has told colleagues at the current G7 summit in Bavaria that all ministers will have to toe the official line. Mr Cameron said that unlike Harold Wilson, who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides of a Common Market referendum in 1975, he expected \\"everyone in government\\" to fight on the same side. \\"I've been very clear that if you want to be part of the government, you have to take the view that we are engaged in an exercise of renegotiation, have a referendum and that will lead to a successful outcome,\\" he said. Meanwhile, Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, dismissed demands by some Tory MPs in the new group for the Westminster parliament to have a unilateral veto over any EU law. \\"That's not achievable, that's not negotiable, because that would effectively be the end of the European Union,\\" he told the BBC. He said a group of national parliaments working together should be able to show a \\"red card\\".

Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Meganâs inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before itâs found. Getting the intranet (no Internet is available) to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school.

(By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway) If you are wondering whether to see \\"Coyote Ugly\\" or not: don't! It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical \\"Chick-Feel-Good-Flick\\", one could say. The plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. The young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in New York. The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the \\"tragic\\" accident of the father, the \\"difficulties\\" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails in convincing one of \\"Jersey's\\" fear of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and quite funny thing) about \\"Coyote Ugly\\" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie. I was very astonished, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie.

However, she ended up going broke because no one could get money to buy.  What might her business have been?  Here are possible answers to this question: - bunkrupt - real estate - stock market - bank - treasure chest  I believe the correct choice is \\"real estate\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The most plausible answer for Sarah's business in this scenario is \\"real estate\\", and there are several reasons for this conclusion. First, real estate is a capital-intensive business, which means that Sarah likely had to invest a significant amount of money upfront to acquire property and develop it. She might have bought land, buildings or both, with the expectation of profiting from rental income, property appreciation, or reselling the assets. In essence, real estate often requires a significant initial investment, which aligns with the fact that Sarah expected a fortune. Second, the real estate market is highly sensitive to economic fluctuations and changes in consumer purchasing power. If, as mentioned in the question, people are unable to get money to buy, it implies an unfavorable economic environment. This could result from factors such as high-interest rates, low wages, or a lack of job opportunities – all of which negatively impact the affordability of property. In such a climate, the demand for property would shrink, causing its value to stagnate or decline. Subsequently, Sarah would have difficulties in leasing or selling her assets, which could result in a significant loss of income. As properties are generally considered to be illiquid and long-term investments, Sarah may have found it difficult to recuperate her losses quickly, leaving her on the verge of bankruptcy. Third, when looking at the other options: - A \\"bunkrupt\\" (sic) does not represent a type of business; it seemingly is a misspelling of the term bankrupt. - The \\"stock market\\" generally refers to the trading of stocks and shares, which would be less applicable as Sarah's primary business. Although investing in stocks can be profitable, it is less likely that her entire fortune would be built around a single stock. - A \\"bank\\" is also an unlikely answer, as it usually serves as a mediator between lenders and borrowers. Banks primarily profit from the spread between the interest they charge on loans and the interest they pay on deposits. This scenario would be less affected by people struggling to get money unless it led to a widespread default on loan repayments. - A \\"treasure chest\\" refers to a container for storing valuables, and it does not represent an actual business venture. In conclusion, based on the provided information and potential answers, the most reasonable choice for Sarah's business would be real estate. This industry's high investment nature, sensitivity to economic fluctuations, and potential impact on her fortune align with the scenario described in the question. Events out of her control, such as an economic downturn, can adversely affect Sarah's business, leading to financial difficulties and ultimately bankruptcy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This can be done by subtracting 75 from both sides of the equation. -23 - 75 = -7*r Simplifying the left side gives: -98 = -7*r Step 3: Solve for \\"r\\" To solve for \\"r\\", we need to get rid of the coefficient -7.

For example, in the sentence \\"This is an interesting assumption\\", the word \\"interesting\\" is the longest word with 12 letters. So, using the criterion of the longest word based on the number of letters, the answer would be \\"Yes\\". Part #2: Answer 'No' if the given word is not the longest word. Usage: Sample response: \\"No\\". For example, in the sentence \\"He solved the problem quickly\\", the word \\"solved\\" is not the longest word, as \\"quickly\\" has more letters. So based on the criterion of the number of letters, the answer would be \\"No\\". Part #3: If there are multiple longest words in a sentence, having the same length, the given word can also be considered the longest. Usage: Sample response: \\"Yes\\". For instance, in the sentence \\"She sang beautifully in the gigantic hall\\", both \\"beautifully\\" and \\"gigantic\\" have 10 letters each.

The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person who died on 10 October 1646? is inside the article: By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair.

The Seahawks would respond with QB Matt Hasselbeck's 23-yard TD pass to WR D.J. Hackett.  In the second quarter, the Big Red increased its lead with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 32-yard field goal, yet Seattle responded with Hasselbeck's 5-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson.  In the third quarter, Arizona temporarily lost the lead as Hasselbeck completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson for the only score of the period.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, Arizona reclaimed the lead and won with Leinart's 5-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald and Rackers' 40-yard field goal.  With the upset win, the Cardinals improved to 4-9. Which quarterback threw more touchdown passes in total?","output":"The article presents a detailed account of a football match between the Cardinals and the Seahawks. Two quarterbacks are mentioned in this article - Matt Leinart from the Cardinals and Matt Hasselbeck from the Seahawks.  Matt Leinart from the Cardinals is credited for throwing two touchdown passes - a 56-yard pass to WR Bryant Johnson in the first quarter, and a 5-yard pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, Matt Hasselbeck from the Seahawks threw three touchdown passes - a 23-yard pass to WR D.J. Hackett in the first quarter, a 5-yard pass to WR Nate Burleson in the second quarter, and a 2-yard pass to WR Darrell Jackson in the third quarter. Therefore, Matt Hasselbeck, the quarterback of the Seattle Seahawks, threw more touchdown passes in total as compared to Matt Leinart of the Cardinals during this particular match."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.   Q: The single circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in what, but instead occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell?

How much time do you have? \\"I can tell you that I don't think there's any other developed country in the world that has remotely the problem we have,\\" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said after the shooting rampage in Colorado. There are an estimated 270 million guns in the hands of civilians in the United States, making Americans the most heavily armed people in the world per capita. Yemen, a tribal nation with no history of strong central government or the rule of law, comes in a distant second. From Washington to the well-stocked shelves of Walmart stores nationwide, guns are regarded in the United States as a commonplace if controversial consumer item for millions of law-abiding hunters, collectors and citizens concerned about their safety. They are also in the hands of thousands of killers too; a Washington-based anti-gun lobby says those guns shoot more than 100,000 people a year. In 2010, there were more than 30,000 deaths caused by firearms when the number of homicides, suicides and accidental deaths are tallied. America's collective memory -- of the Wild West in the 1800s, the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King half a century ago and the front-page news from last week -- is marked time and time again by guns. \\"It's undeniable,\\" writes Clayton Cramer, author of \\"Armed America: the Remarkable Story of How and Why Guns Became as American as Apple Pie.\\" \\"Guns are at the center of much of America's history, its legends, and its horrors.\\" There were guns in America long before the America we know today was even born. Early settlers in several states were required by law to own and maintain weapons as a matter of collective defense. By the time the United States was established, its citizens had taken up arms not only against their Native American neighbors but the army of their own king. Their new constitution reflected that in its Bill of Rights, declaring that \\"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\\" For more than two centuries, that remained an important but largely overlooked guarantee, subjected to a modest series of controls. But in 2008 and 2010, landmark Supreme Court rulings gave that constitutional right sweeping new power, dramatically diminishing the authority of state and local governments to limit gun ownership. Gun-friendly lawmakers have been active, too. Roughly half of the 50 U.S. states have adopted laws allowing gun owners to carry their guns openly in most public places. About as many states have \\"stand your ground\\" laws that allow people to kill if they come under threat, even, in some cases, if they can escape the threat without violence. The laws are being driven by politics, and the politics are being driven by groups such as the National Rifle Association. Once a relatively modest organization of gun enthusiasts and hunters, it has become one of the most powerful political groups in the country. The Washington Post estimates that the NRA succeeded in helping elect four out of every five candidates it endorsed in the most recent congressional election. In addition to that extraordinary impact in Congress, it has been working to overturn gun-control laws in the courts. The NRA and other gun-rights groups have allied themselves with the Republican Party and, especially, a sector of the American public suspicious of government intrusions into private life and often flatly hostile to Washington. Read Dana Bash: For Democrats, gun politics are bad politics. \\"When they tell you that a government ban on certain firearms will somehow make you safer, don't you believe it, not for a second, because it's a lie just like the lies they've told you before,\\" NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told a recent gathering of his members. \\"Their laws don't work.\\" Poll results suggest most Americans wouldn't agree. CNN and Gallup surveys going back years suggest that Americans are split between those who approve of current gun-control laws and respondents who would like to see them made more restrictive. Americans who'd like no controls at all are a small minority. But even after the rampage in Colorado, American attitudes and laws aren't likely to change much. Last year's nearly fatal shooting of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords didn't move her state or federal colleagues to adopt any new gun control measures. Both President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney issued statements in the hours after the Colorado shootings, and Sunday, Obama flew to the state to visit with shooting victims and their families. But neither proposed any changes to American attitudes toward guns. \\"You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,\\" said New York's Bloomberg, who is both a declared \\"independent\\" politically and a vocal proponent of gun control. America is not unique. Norwegians are marking the first anniversary of a shooting massacre that took the lives of 69 people at a summer camp outside of Oslo. Eight more people were that day killed by a bomb in the Norwegian capital itself. The confessed killer is awaiting the verdict of his trial. But America seems to be the place the whole world thinks of when apparently ordinary people use guns for grotesque acts of violence. America stands alone in its historic and cultural attachment to guns. America stands armed. Do you own a gun? Tell us why. Opinion: Mass murder and powerful firearms. Opinion: Gun control or carry permits won't stop mass murder. Opinion: Fear drives opposition to gun control. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

They are typically wire antennas multiple wavelengths long, through which the voltage and current waves travel in one direction, instead of bouncing back and forth to form standing waves as in resonant antennas. They have linear polarization (except for the helical antenna). Unidirectional traveling wave antennas are terminated by a resistor at one end equal to the antenna's characteristic resistance, to absorb the waves from one direction. This makes them inefficient as transmitting antennas. Now answer this question: What is the resistor equal to?","output":"In the context of unidirectional traveling wave antennas, the resistor at one end is equal to the antenna's characteristic impedance or resistance. This resistor serves the purpose of absorbing the voltage and current waves traveling in one direction, preventing reflections and formation of standing waves, which are undesirable in a traveling wave antenna's operation. Characteristic impedance is a crucial parameter in antenna design and is typically represented by the symbol Z₀. It is a measure of the resistance faced by the electromagnetic waves as they travel along the transmission line (or antenna in this case). The characteristic impedance is inherent to the antenna, and it depends on various factors such as the antenna's geometry, materials used, and surrounding environment. Connecting a resistor equal to the characteristic impedance at one end of the traveling wave antenna ensures that the transmitted energy is effectively absorbed with minimal reflections. This termination helps to maintain the desired radiation pattern, achieve broader bandwidth operation, and improve the performance of the antenna. In summary, in unidirectional traveling wave antennas, the resistor at one end is equal to the antenna's characteristic impedance to facilitate the absorption of voltage and current waves traveling in one direction. This termination is crucial for the efficient operation of traveling wave antennas, preventing standing waves and allowing for broader bandwidth functionality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808, but the domestic trade, with sales to the Deep South , expanded dramatically, and many captives were shipped by the coastwise slave trade . Question: when slavery abolished","output":"The abolishment of slavery in the United States cannot be simply answered with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no,\\" as it requires a more in-depth response to provide an accurate understanding of the historical events surrounding it. Slavery was abolished in the United States in several stages. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, was an executive order that declared all slaves in the Confederate states to be free. However, this proclamation did not immediately free all slaves, as it only applied to the states in rebellion against the Union and did not pertain to the border states that allowed slavery. The turning point for the nationwide abolishment of slavery came with the passage of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment, ratified on December 6, 1865, decisively abolished slavery throughout the entire United States and its territories, stating: \\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\"  It is important to note that while the United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808, this action did not outlaw slavery itself. Slavery continued to exist, especially in the United States, where the domestic slave trade expanded as demand for slave labor grew in the Deep South due to the expansion of the agricultural economy. The coastwise slave trade facilitated the movement of enslaved people from the northern states to the southern states and further entrenched slavery in the nation. Therefore, to answer the question, \\"When was slavery abolished?\\"—slavery was officially abolished in the United States on December 6, 1865, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For those ages 65 and older, this year's vaccine helped in just 9% of cases against the predominant strain, a percentage deemed to be statistically insignificant by the CDC. Factoring in all ages, the vaccine helped in 56% of cases, which is on the low side historically, reports Reuters. \\"We simply need a better vaccine against influenza, one that works better and lasts longer,\\" says CDC chief Thomas Frieden. Vaccines are generally less effective in older people, but that's not enough to explain the poor showing among seniors, whose hospitalization rates for the flu this year have been especially high, reports AP. Expand this summary.","output":"USA Today reports that senior citizens, aged 65 and older, may not have benefited much from this year's flu vaccine as it was only effective in 9% of cases against the predominant strain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This percentage is considered to be statistically insignificant and highlights the need for the development of a more effective vaccine, especially for older individuals who are more susceptible to the virus. This year's vaccine's overall success rate, across all age groups, stands at 56%— a figure that is lower than the historical average. CDC chief Thomas Frieden calls for the creation of a better vaccine against influenza that can provide improved protection and longer-lasting immunity. While it is generally acknowledged that vaccines tend to be less effective in older people due to their weaker immune systems, this alone fails to account for the particularly poor performance of this year's flu vaccine among seniors. The hospitalization rates for senior citizens with the flu have been especially high, notes the Associated Press, underscoring the urgency of creating a more potent vaccine. It is important for researchers and the medical community to continue working towards better understanding the factors that contribute to the reduced effectiveness of vaccines in older individuals and invest more resources into the development of improved flu vaccines. The fact that the flu vaccine worked only modestly well for a majority of the population this year serves as a reminder that it remains crucial for people to take other preventive measures, such as practicing good hand hygiene, avoiding close contact with those who are sick, and staying home when experiencing flu-like symptoms. These precautions can help to prevent the spread of the virus and minimize the health risks associated with the flu. For senior citizens, it is particularly important to remain vigilant in protecting their health during flu season. In addition to receiving the annual flu vaccine, seniors should also focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle by adopting practices such as eating well, getting regular exercise, and obtaining adequate sleep. These habits can help to strengthen the immune system and reduce the likelihood of complications from the flu. Furthermore, healthcare providers need to be proactive in advising their older patients on ways to prevent the flu and to closely monitor their health condition during flu season. This can include recommending antiviral medications in high-risk situations, providing regular check-ups, and ensuring a swift response in the event of flu-related complications. In conclusion, the poor performance of this year's flu vaccine among senior citizens is a cause for concern and underscores the need for the development of more effective vaccines. Meanwhile, the medical community must emphasize the importance of preventive measures, healthcare providers should closely monitor the health of older patients during flu season, and seniors should focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of complications from the flu."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information:  - Time Warner, Inc. (also known as AOL Time Warner from 2001-2003; stylized as TimeWarner) is an American multinational media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate. Time Warner was first founded in 1990 with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its most popular assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW Television Network, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%. In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014.  - Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass. Constipation is a common cause of painful defecation. Severe constipation includes obstipation (failure to pass stools or gas) and fecal impaction, which can progress to bowel obstruction and become life-threatening.  - Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , \\"Afnistn\\"), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world.  - Satellite television is  according to \\"article 1.39\\" of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR)  a \\"Broadcasting-satellite service\\".  - Home Box Office (HBO) is an American premium cable and satellite television network that is owned by Time Warner through its respective flagship company Home Box Office, Inc. Programming featured on the network consists primarily of theatrically released motion pictures and original television series, along with made-for-cable movies and documentaries, boxing matches, and occasional stand-up comedy and concert specials.  - Sherwin David \\"Wood\\" Harris (born October 17, 1969) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles as the drug kingpin Avon Barksdale on the HBO crime drama \\"The Wire\\", cocaine dealer Ace in \\"Paid in Full\\" and high school football player Julius Campbell in the 2000 film \\"Remember the Titans\\".  - Avon Randolph Barksdale is a fictional character in \\"The Wire\\", played by Wood Harris. Avon is one of the more powerful drug dealers in Baltimore, Maryland, running the Barksdale Organization. His Organization territory is based in the heart of west Baltimore's ghetto, solidifying his power in the drug trade.  - Opium (poppy tears, with the scientific name: \\"Lachryma papaveris\\") is the dried latex obtained from the opium poppy (scientific name: \\"Papaver somniferum\\"). Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for the illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch (\\"score\\") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word \\"meconium\\" (derived from the Greek for \\"opium-like\\", but now used to refer to infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies.  - Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring.  - Naltrexone is a medication that reverses the effects of opioids and is used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence.  - Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia. Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as \\"the captain of the men of death\\". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called \\"the old man's friend\\".  - Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant \\"Papaver somniferum\\". The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. The term \\"opiate\\" should be differentiated from the broader term \\"opioid,\\" which includes all drugs with morphine-like effects, including opiates, semi-synthetic opioids derived from opiates (such as heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone), and synthetic opioids which are not derived from opiates (such as fentanyl, buprenorphine, and methadone). All opioids, including the opiates, are considered drugs of high abuse potential and are listed on various \\"Substance-Control Schedules\\" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States.  - The Barksdale Organization is a fictional drug dealing gang on the television series \\"The Wire\\". Many of the characters featured in season one of The Wire belong to this organization. Season one largely deals with the Baltimore Police Department setting up a Major Crimes Unit to investigate the organization. The Barksdale Organization is led by Avon Barksdale who is portrayed as the most powerful drug kingpin in Baltimore.  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - Melvin Douglas \`\` Little Melvin '' Williams ( December 14 , 1941 -- December 3 , 2015 ) was an American actor and criminal . He was known for trafficking heroin in his native Baltimore , Maryland , in the 1970s and 1980s . He appeared as an actor in the HBO series The Wire , which explores many Baltimore - related subjects , including narcotics trafficking , and served as an inspiration for the character of Avon Barksdale .  - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition.  - Heroin, also known as diamorphine among other names, is an opiate typically used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Medically it is occasionally used to relieve pain and as a form of opioid replacement therapy alongside counseling. Heroin is typically injected, usually into a vein; however, it can also be smoked, snorted or inhaled. Onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours. Common side effects include respiratory depression (decreased breathing) and about a quarter of those who use heroin become physically dependent. Other side effects can include abscesses, infected heart valves, blood borne infections, constipation, and pneumonia. After a history of long-term use, withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of last use. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect as a similar dose of morphine. It typically comes as a white or brown powder. Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. Medications used may include methadone or naltrexone. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. An estimated 17 million people as of 2015 use opiates such as heroin, which together with opioids resulted in 122,000 deaths. The total number of opiate users has increased from 1998 to 2007 after which it has remained more or less stable. In the United States about 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point in time. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid. Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell heroin without a license. In 2015 Afghanistan produced about 66% of the world's opium. Often heroin, which is illegally sold, is mixed with other substances such as sugar or strychnine.  - David Judah Simon (born February 9, 1960) is an American author, journalist, and a writer/producer of television series.

Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon, the series was broadcast by the cable network HBO in the United States. \\"The Wire\\" premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.  - The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 is an international treaty to prohibit production and supply of specific (nominally narcotic) drugs and of drugs with similar effects except under licence for specific purposes, such as medical treatment and research. As noted below, its major effects included updating the Paris Convention of 13 July 1931 to include the vast number of synthetic opioids invented in the intervening thirty years and a mechanism for more easily including new ones. From 1931 to 1961, most of the families of synthetic opioids had been developed, including drugs in whatever way related to methadone, pethidine, morphinans and dextromoramide and related drugs; research on fentanyls and piritramide was also nearing fruition at that point.  - The verb license or grant license means to give permission. The noun licence (British, Indian, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, or South African English) or license (American English) refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission.  - Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors to produce morphine-like effects. Opioids are most often used medically to relieve pain, and by people addicted to opioids. Opioids include , an older term that refers to such drugs derived from , including morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms and are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. , derived from words meaning or , as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In other jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as \\"narcotics\\". The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where that is the case. Primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia they are also used to suppress cough, suppress diarrhea, treat addiction, reverse opioid overdose, and suppress opioid induced constipation. Extremely strong opioids are approved only for veterinary use such as immobilizing large mammals. Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Opioid drugs include partial agonists and antagonists, which produce moderate or no effect (respectively) but displace other opioids from binding in those receptors. The side effects of opioids may include itchiness, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Tolerance and dependence will develop with continuous use, requiring increasing doses and leading to a withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation. The euphoria attracts recreational use, and...    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'field of work' with 'illegal drug trade'.

The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon.  Question: \\"How many possible hijackings were there?\\" Answer: \\"More than 4\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Options: (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"Answer: (a). no. Explanation: In the paragraph, it says that the deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" So there were only four possible hijackings mentioned in the paragraph, not more than four. That's why the answer \\"More than 4\\" is incorrect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Plot title: Before Night Falls Movie plot: Before Night Falls is based on the autobiography of the same name by Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas. In the film, Arenas, who was openly gay, is born in Oriente in 1943 and raised by his single mother and her parents, who soon move the entire family to HolguÃ­n. After moving to Havana in the sixties to continue his studies, Reinaldo begins to explore his ambitions, as well as his sexuality. After receiving an honorary mention in a writing contest, Arenas is offered the chance to publish his first work. Through his work and friendships with other openly gay men (such as Pepe Malas and Tomas Diego), Arenas manages to find himself. The political climate in Cuba becomes increasingly dangerous, and in the early seventies Arenas is arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting minors, and for publishing abroad without official consent. In the next decade, Arenas is in and out of prison, attempting and failing to leave the country several times. In 1980, Arenas finally leaves Cuba for the US, starting a new life with his close friend Lazaro Gomez Carriles.

She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance in general is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has to get over. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? ---- Deborah A: First let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found at fairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially _ , for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also prove an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. ---- Ms. Kravis Options: A She is applying for a master's degree.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Sousveillance is the recording of an activity by a participant in the activity, typically by way of small wearable or portable personal technologies. The term \\"sousveillance\\", coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words \\"sur\\", meaning \\"above\\", and \\"sous\\", meaning \\"below\\", i.e. \\"surveillance\\" denotes the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" watching from above, whereas \\"sousveillance\\" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching).  - The Corps of Royal Marines (RM) is the United Kingdom's amphibious light infantry force, forming part of the Naval Service, along with the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines were formed in 1755 as the Royal Navy's infantry troops. However, the marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664.  - The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \\"better defence of the realm\\", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \\"artillery\\" in \\"Honourable Artillery Company\\" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \\"Honourable Infantry Company\\" or \\"Honourable Military Company.\\"  - Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.  - The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces . The unit resources include communications , information operations , information systems , intelligence , surveillance , and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ( ISTAR ) . It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion , the UK Landing Force Command Support Group , which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM. The unit 's title harks back to the original 30 Commando ( which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM ) , formed in 1942 . This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces , or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land , sea or air , to capture much needed intelligence , in the form of codes , documents , equipment or enemy personnel . In 2013 , 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton , West Sussex , in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War .  - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area.  - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid.  - The English Army existed while England was an independent state and was at war with other states, but it was not until the Interregnum and the New Model Army (raised by Parliament to defeat the Royalists in the English Civil War) that England acquired a peacetime professional standing army. At the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II kept a small standing army, formed from elements of the Royalist army in exile and elements of the New Model Army, from which the most senior regular regiments of today's British Army can trace their antecedence. Likewise, Royal Marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664.  - Postal interception is the act of retrieving another person's mail for the purpose of ensuring that the mail is not delivered to the recipient, or to spy on them.  - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Light infantry (or skirmishers) are soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry was distinct from medium, heavy or line infantry. Heavy infantry were dedicated primarily to fighting in tight formations that were the core of large battles. Light infantry fought in open-order, often in close co-ordination with heavy infantry, where they could screen the heavy infantry from harassing fire, and the heavy infantry could intervene to protect the light infantry from attacks of enemy heavy infantry or cavalry. Heavy infantry originally had heavier arms and more armour than light infantry, but this distinction was lost as the use of armour declined and gunpowder weapons became standardized.  - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency.  - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.  - Surveillance (or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, no- or relatively low-technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception. The word \\"\\" comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"), and is in contrast to more recent developments such as sousveillance.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the Royal Horse Artillery and the US Cavalry, where troops are subunits that compare to an infantry company or artillery battery.   - Internet traffic is the flow of data across the Internet.    What is the relationship between '30 commando information exploitation group' and 'naval service'? Answer:","output":"The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces. The Naval Service, which consists of the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, is a part of the British Armed Forces tasked with defending the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. Therefore, the relationship between the 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group and the Naval Service is that the 30 Commando is a unit within the Royal Marines, which in turn falls under the larger umbrella of the Naval Service."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As I breathlessly put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the sales agent said with a broad smile. \\"Oh that bus left five minutes ago.\\" Dreams of head cutting! It's not the news that makes someone angry. It's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must give bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient that she needs an operation does it in a caring way.

The Trevi Fountain, or \\"Fontana di Trevi\\" in Italian, is an iconic symbol of the city, located in the Trevi district of Rome. This Baroque-style masterpiece was designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762. The fountain is an amalgamation of art, history, and legend. The central figure of the sculpture portrays Oceanus, the Titan god of water in ancient Roman mythology. This water deity is escorted by two Tritons, who are depicted as guiding the shell-shaped chariot through the water. They embody the contrasting moods of the sea, with one taming a more spirited seahorse, while the other steers its calm counterpart. To the sides, Abundance and Salubrity signify the fountain's purpose of ensuring a continued supply of water to the city. The Eternal City, Rome, is a historical and cultural treasure trove, with attractions catering to a diverse range of interests. From ancient sites such as the Colosseum, Pantheon, and the Roman Forum, to piazzas teeming with life and beauty like Piazza Navona and Piazza di Spagna, there is no shortage of sights to explore. Moreover, the spiritual significance of Rome is evident in the presence of the Vatican City - the heart of the Roman Catholic Church.

Compare population figures: Compare the population data from 2010 with the more recent figures to see if there is an increase in the number of residents in Elmira. 3. Consider other factors: Analyze possible factors that could have influenced the population change (e.g., economic conditions, job opportunities, and migration patterns) to help justify the observed change in population. 4. Draw conclusion: Based on the available information and any observed change in the population numbers, infer if Elmira's population has indeed risen since the 2010 census. Without more recent data, we cannot infer whether Elmira's population rose after 2010 based solely on the information provided."},{"instruction":"Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: For many kids playing baseball is an American pastime, it brings them great what to play?

Identify Emotion Expressing Words:     Here, text words like \\"miss\\" and \\"you too\\" express the sender's feelings. The word \\"miss\\" is generally associated with feelings of absence and longing, which can be perceived as a feeling of sadness. However, \\"you too\\" implies a mutual understanding or reciprocation, which adds a sense of positive emotion. 2. Examine Punctuation:    The usage of double exclamation points indicates strong sentiment or heightened emotions. This is typically associated with positive feelings of excitement or happiness. 3. Context Consideration:     Here, the context seems to be a social interaction where one user is expressing their feelings to another user @foolishsyntax.  Considering these factors, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as 'Positive'.

Choices:  - affecting systems  - nervous systems  - immune systems  - reproductive systems  A: Answer:","output":"Examples of organ systems in a human include the skeletal, nervous, and immune systems, as well as reproductive systems.  Skeletal System: The skeletal system comprises of bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. It provides structural support, protection, and stability for the human body. The skeletal system's primary functions include supporting the body's weight, facilitating movement by working with muscles, protecting vital organs such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs, producing blood cells through bone marrow, and serving as a mineral and energy reserve. Nervous System: The nervous system is a complex network of nerves and specialized cells called neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It has two main components: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord, and it acts as the body's control center, processing information from the senses, coordinating movement, and controlling physiological functions. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the CNS to the body's muscles, glands, and sensory receptors, enabling the central nervous system to communicate with the rest of the body. Immune System: The immune system defends the body against infections, diseases, and foreign substances. It consists of a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and molecules that work together to recognize and eliminate harmful substances or pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The immune system has two primary components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense, providing immediate, non-specific protection against pathogens. The adaptive immune system is responsible for specific, long-term defense against specific pathogens and involves the production of antibodies and the activation of immune cells. Reproductive System: The reproductive system in humans is responsible for the production, development, and maturation of gametes (sperm and eggs) and the fertilization process, which leads to the development of a new individual. In males, the reproductive system includes the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and penis. These structures are involved in the production, transport, and release of sperm. In females, the reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. These structures are involved in the production and maturation of eggs, fertilization, and development of the embryo and fetus during pregnancy. In conclusion, the human body consists of various organ systems that perform essential functions for maintaining life, such as the skeletal, nervous, immune, and reproductive systems. Each of these systems plays a crucial role in various aspects of the organism's overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A hero American diver who helped in the search for the body of a senior government minister killed in a plane crash in the Philippines last year has been murdered with a shotgun blast in the face. Matthew Caldwell, 59, who had joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo was hit at point blank range with a 12-gauge shotgun, said Senior Superintendent Adolfo Samala of Las Pinas police. Mr Caldwell, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage. Deep sea diver: Matthew Caldwell, 59, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage. He was among the first to be called upon in August last year when a Piper Seneca plane carrying Mr Robredo crashed in the waters off Masbate. Because of the great depth at which the aircraft was believed to be lying, Mr Caldwell's skills, along with those of two unidentified British divers, were required to search for the wreckage. Local hero: Caldwell joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo (pictured), who died when his plane crashed in the waters of Masbate. He had attended a meeting of the coast guard on Thursday night when shortly afterwards he became involved in an argument with a security guard as he and his live-in partner, Miss Jeanelyn Flora, 36, were heading to their home in Las Pinas, five miles south of Manila. According to police the security guard, named as Ericson Elacquio, prevented Mr Caldwell from entering his road because he said the American had not paid monthly dues to the homeowners' association. When the guard continued to refuse to raise a wooden beam blocking the road, Mr Caldwell got out of his Toyota Corolla and tried to raise the barrier himself. It was then, as tempers flared, said Superintendent Samala, that the security guard raised his shotgun and fired it straight into Mr Caldwell's face, killing him instantly. The guard and a companion commandeered a motor cycle and spend off into the night. 'We have launched a major search for him,' said Superintendent Samala. 'We are confident we will find him.' As well as helping to locate the wreckage of the aircraft carrying Mr Robredo, Mr Caldwell had previously been involved in recovering bodies from a sunken wood-hulled passenger ship, the Catalyn B., which collied with a steel-hulled fishing vessel on Christmas Even, 2009.","output":"A brave American diver named Matthew Caldwell, who once helped find a missing important person in a plane crash, was sadly killed in the Philippines.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Native American sand paintings are a very beautiful and popular art form for collectors today. But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry  of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects. In some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits. The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings. It is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s. A trader, Rex Bollin, recommended Fred to sell sand paintings since they were so beautiful.... Question: Why would people destroy the sand paintings after the healing ceremony? Options: A: Because the paintings are useless after the ceremony. B: Because people don't know how to keep the paintings for long. C: Because the paintings are believed to contain illnesses. D: Because the paintings are believed to contain the spirit of God.

Ottawa (CNN)Christianne Boudreau's voice wavers slightly as she recounts how her little boy became an ISIS militant. Every word seems tinged with anger and regret, but most of all, purpose. The process of radicalization is gradual and persuasive, she said. And deadly. Her son, who joined ISIS's ranks in Syria, was killed in fighting there more than a year ago. \\"It's so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,\\" she said. Boudreau's son, Damian Clairmont, converted to Islam after a troubling period in high school in Calgary, Canada. The mother remembers her son's religion bringing him peace. She didn't suspect anything when Clairmont told her he was leaving for Egypt to study Arabic. Canadian security officials came to her door in 2013, breaking the news that Clairmont was suspected of being a militant and was likely in Syria, not in","output":"Egypt as he had claimed. Shock and disbelief soon gave way to despair as Boudreau realized the extent of her son's deception and his involvement with ISIS. The once-apprehensive mother grappled with the escalating situation, struggling to comprehend how her child had been led down this dark path. Damian Clairmont's radicalization began soon after his conversion. He reportedly attended a mosque in Calgary, where he was introduced to the ISIS ideology. The radical teachings exploited his vulnerabilities, altering his perception and filling him with extremist beliefs. The allure of camaraderie and the prospect of a utopian Islamic society lured him away from his family. As Boudreau spent sleepless nights worrying about her son, she reached out to other families who had experienced similar heartache. Through her extensive research and interactions, Boudreau gained insight into the tactics employed by extremist groups to lure in vulnerable individuals, particularly Western youth. Additionally, she began to recognize the warning signs of radicalization, which she had missed in Damian's case. Desperate to bring attention to this epidemic, Boudreau started sharing her story with anyone willing to listen. She sought to raise awareness of the deceptive tactics employed by radical groups and demonstrated the need for better early-intervention programs. Boudreau ultimately became an advocate in the fight against radicalization by founding a support organization that helps families prevent their loved ones from falling into the hands of extremist groups. Boudreau's work is a testament to her tireless efforts in preventing radicalization and assisting families in coping with their grief. Her message acts as a warning to parents everywhere: it can happen to anyone. She emphasizes the importance of open communication with children, fostering safe spaces for dialogue, and addressing misconceptions about religion and culture. Today, Christianne Boudreau is a driving force in combating radicalization. She pushes for the development of deradicalization programs, educates parents and communities about the warning signs, and equips them with the necessary tools to intervene before it's too late. Boudreau's life has undoubtedly been changed by the loss of her son, but her purpose remains steadfast: to prevent other families from enduring a similar tragedy.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Paragraph: Nigeria invested in sand mining and started mining coastal barriers.

She secures a record deal, and her debut album is met with critical acclaim and fan enthusiasm. At the peak of her newfound success, she begins experiencing frequent fatigue and shortness of breath. Initially, she attributes it to her demanding schedule, but when the symptoms begin to worsen, she decides to consult a doctor.  The diagnosis is devastating: viral cardiomyopathy, a severe heart condition caused by a viral infection that weakens the heart muscles and disrupts its ability to pump blood efficiently. Given her declining health, Hilary is forced to halt her soaring career as she begins a wrenching battle against the illness.  As she tries to come to terms with her condition, Hilary discovers solace in support groups and even forms unexpected friendships with recovering addicts and patients battling their own medical demons. One such bond develops between her and Jason, an accomplished dancer who has developed hip dysplasia and is now unable to continue his passion.  This shared inability to pursue their careers unites Hilary and Jason, and they find refuge in each other's company. They begin to learn to embrace life differently, finding beauty in the smaller things and learning to ride the emotional waves with optimism. A romantic relationship blossoms between them, as they serve as each other's pillars in their parallel struggles. Meanwhile, Hilary refuses to let her music fade away, even if she can no longer perform on stage. She begins composing new songs as a form of therapy and starts recording them in her home studio, pouring her emotions into each word and melody. This new music resonates with her fans, who become inspired by her resilience and raw vulnerability. Hilary's viral cardiomyopathy continues to progress, with medical treatments generating limited progress. As her health reaches an all-time low, she is placed on the waiting list for a heart transplant. Time is running out, but hope flickers as she and Jason remain determined to make the most of whatever life has left in store. In the climax, Hilary undergoes a risky heart transplant surgery, and while her survival is not guaranteed, we see her immense courage and strength in facing the unknown.

Solution:","output":"Part #1: Define the categories - obscene and non-obscene. Usage: Obscene comments are offensive to the public sense of decency and may relate to sex or contain taboo language. Non-obscene comments do not meet these criteria. In this case, the comment does not contain any offensive or taboo language and is non-obscene. Part #2: Determine if the comment is offensive to the public sense of decency. Usage: In the given comment, the author expresses the need for a nationwide sweep to eliminate gangs. Although the comparison to \\"biting ants\\" and \\"pavement\\" could be considered violent imagery, the comment isn't offensive to public decency as it concerns a societal issue. Thus, it is not obscene. Part #3: Check if the comment obviously relates to sex. Usage: The comment does not contain any content that relates to sex. It discusses the issue of gangs. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria of an obscene comment in this regard. Part #4: Check if the comment contains taboo language. Usage: The comment includes words like \\"nationwide sweep,\\" \\"squash,\\" \\"gangs,\\" and \\"biting ants.\\" None of these words are considered taboo language. Thus, this comment doesn't contain any taboo language and is not obscene.

For hundreds of years the flower is used by Mother Gothel to retain her youth until it is discovered by soldiers of a nearby kingdom, Corona. They use the flower to heal their ailing queen, who soon afterwards gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's hair has the flower's healing properties. However, attempting to take just the hair by cutting a piece from it destroys its power, and so she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter in an isolated tower. Once a year, the King and Queen release sky lanterns on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter's return. Nearing her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel asks Gothel for permission to leave the tower and discover the source of the lanterns, but Gothel refuses, telling her that the outside world is a dangerous place. Elsewhere, a thief known as Flynn Rider has stolen Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his cohorts, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers the crown, but is unaware of its significance. Rapunzel plans to show Flynn to Gothel in order to prove she can take care of herself, but when Gothel becomes enraged at Rapunzel's insistent desire to leave, she asks for a special paint that will take Gothel three days' round trip to obtain and return. Gothel agrees and departs. Rapunzel convinces Flynn to escort her to see the lanterns in exchange for the crown. During their excursion, Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a pub filled with the frightening people Gothel warned Rapunzel about, but who instead are charmed by Rapunzel's innocence. When the royal soldiers appear searching for Flynn, the pub regulars help the pair escape. The soldiers give chase, led by Maximus, one of the lead horses in the royal army, and locate them at a dam. The dam is inadvertently breached, and the resulting deluge traps...

When the interviewer first broached the tender subject — observing that \\"a bit of ['Born This Way'] does sound quite a lot\\" like Madonna's song — Gaga vehemently denied having knowingly referenced it, saying, \\"I am not stupid enough to put out a record and be that moronic.\\"      But the interviewer pressed on, and that's when she really went off:      No. Listen to me. Why the f**k? I'm a songwriter...Why would I try to put out a song and think I'm getting one over on everybody? That's retarded. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only similarities are the chord progression. It's the same on that's been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first f**king artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist. It means I'm f**king smart. Sorry.      The reporter then changed the subject to Gaga's new single, \\"Judas.\\" But the singer, now in tears, only wanted to talk about \\"Born This Way.\\"      I feel like honestly that God sent me those lyrics and that melody...There's no way for something that pure to be wrong.      Not to add yet another sermon, but it's getting a little difficult to stay sympathetic to Gaga's divine cause when she casually throws around terms like \\"retarded.\\" Last time I checked, the intellectually disabled were born that way, too.

Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student read less about the production of the highly toxic dimethylmercury?  Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: A treatment plan should be tailored to your condition, physical and mental health history.  It may use detoxification, behavioural or other counselling, medication, evaluation, and follow up treatment. A treatment plan should help you to stop using drugs, stay drug free, and live the life you want to live. Your doctor should ask you about substance abuse in a non-judgemental  manner, and try to  learn more about your quantity, frequency, duration, and route of administration of drug. If you do not have an insurance plan, you can still find medical attention for drug rehabilitation. Finding medical help without insurance is more difficult but entirely feasible.  Go to a community health care clinic. Community health care clinics offer services that are just as good as the private health care clinics. They have sliding scales so that you pay what you can afford.  Find a cash based medical provider. There are doctors who work on a cash only system. Since they do not have to deal with the insurance bureaucracy, they can sometimes pass along savings to the customer.  Use web based tools to find a doctor you can afford. For instance, you can use the OkCopay website to search for a doctor that meets your needs and price range. Consider the location, price, duration, and style of treatment at the facility. Some recovery facilities are focused on the spiritual aspects of addiction. A medical model is emphasized at other facilities.  Look into whether your insurance policy covers drug rehabilitation programs.  Rehabilitation can be difficult to get coverage for under your insurance. Talk to your insurance provider, especially if you have a dual diagnosis of psychiatric and substance abuse, which is common. If so, then your insurance policy is more likely to cover the costs. Consider whether you need a place that addresses both spiritual and medical aspects of your condition. This form of therapy emphasizes the need to learn new skills and behaviors in the recovery process. Cognitive-behavioral therapy empowers the individual with effective ways of coping with the urge to take drugs. The skills learned during this form of therapy can be retained years after recovery has been completed. Behavioral therapy can also help you avoid triggers. It can help you cope with and avoid the people, places, and things you associate with taking drugs. It can help to talk to people who are going through similar experiences. There are many support groups for people who are trying to overcome drug abuse. People who participate in support groups are typically more likely to remain clean and sober because it allows them to surround themselves with non-users.  Cocaine Anonymous is a support group for people who want to get clean from cocaine and other mind altering substances. Check out a meeting in your area.  Narcotics Anonymous is a support group for people wishing to recover from narcotics. The only requirement to join is a desire to stop using drugs.  Nicotine Anonymous is a support group for people hoping to quit smoking and nicotine addiction.","output":"A treatment plan for drug rehabilitation should be customized to an individual's condition, considering their physical and mental health history. Detoxification, counseling, medication, evaluation, and follow-up treatments are all potential components of a plan. The aims are to stop drug use, maintain a drug-free life, and achieve personal goals. Doctors should approach the topic sensitively and inquire about drug use details. Lack of insurance shouldn't deter someone from seeking help; options include community health care clinics with sliding payment scales, cash-based medical providers, and web-based tools to find affordable doctors. It's essential to consider factors like location, cost, treatment duration, and treatment style when choosing a facility. Furthermore, explore the extent of insurance coverage for rehabilitation, as psychiatric conditions may increase the likelihood of approval. Therapies can address spiritual, medical, and behavioral aspects of addiction, teaching coping strategies and trigger avoidance. Support groups, such as Cocaine Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Nicotine Anonymous, can help individuals overcome addiction by connecting them with others experiencing similar challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's break down the elements of the tweet to understand the underlying emotions and tone: 1. \\"@ROCKGUITARZ\\": The use of a username as a mention indicates that the tweet is directed at a specific person. This gives the tweet a personal and conversational tone, making the statement feel more like a casual remark made in a friendly conversation rather than a generic comment. 2. \\"It's always a good day\\": This phrase sets the overall tone of positivity for the tweet. By saying that something makes the day \\"good,\\" the tweeter implies that whatever is being discussed has a significant impact on their happiness and overall well-being. 3. \\"when I don't have to cook\\": This part of the tweet reveals the specific situation that makes the tweeter feel good – not having to cook. The use of the phrase \\"don't have to\\" suggests that cooking might be seen as a chore or an activity that they don't necessarily enjoy. This is further reinforced by the word \\"always\\" in the phrase \\"It's always a good day,\\" indicating that avoiding cooking is consistently associated with a positive outcome. 4. Use of humor and lightheartedness: Although the tweet addresses a personal preference (not cooking), it does not come off as a strong complaint or a deeply emotional statement. Instead, the tone is kept light and relatable, making it seem more like a playful comment that others could easily connect to. Considering these elements, we can describe the sentiment of the tweet as positive – the tweeter is expressing happiness and satisfaction when they don't have to cook. Additionally, the light, conversational tone and the humorous, relatable way the preference is presented suggest a lightheartedness that further enhances the positive sentiment. Overall, this tweet can be seen as a cheerful and upbeat contribution to a conversation, likely to evoke agreement, empathy, or friendly reactions from others who feel the same way about cooking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc (French: [fRasis Za maRsel pulek]; 7 January 1899 - 30 January 1963) was a French composer and pianist. His compositions include melodies, solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite Trois mouvements perpetuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champetre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the Organ Concerto (1938), the opera Dialogues des Carmelites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. See also: FP (Catalogue of compositions), List of compositions  Poulenc's music is essentially diatonic. In Henri Hell's view, this is because the main feature of Poulenc's musical art is his melodic gift. In the words of Roger Nichols in the Grove dictionary, \\"For [Poulenc] the most important element of all was melody and he found his way to a vast treasury of undiscovered tunes within an area that had, according to the most up-to-date musical maps, been surveyed, worked and exhausted.\\" The commentator George Keck writes, \\"His melodies are simple, pleasing, easily remembered, and most often emotionally expressive.\\"  Poulenc said that he was not inventive in his harmonic language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, \\"All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity.\\" Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language \\"as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing ... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing\\". Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for \\"a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!\\" He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to dodecaphony, led by Rene Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is \\"directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice\\". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up - \\"la legende de facilite\\" - that his music came easily to him; he commented, \\"The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts.\\"  The pianist Pascal Roge commented in 1999 that both sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: \\"You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale photocopy of what he really is.\\" Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was \\"healthy, clear and robust - music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav\\".

However, rather than capitalizing on its potential to be appealing and even educational for younger audiences, the movie ends up falling short due to a weak plot, uninspired characters, and blatant product placements that amount to nothing more than a series of unrelatable \\"inside jokes.\\" The premise of the movie centers around Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), an emoji who is designated to be \\"meh\\" but struggles to hide his technical glitch of having multiple emotions. Desperate to become \\"normal,\\" he sets off on a quest to find a code that can fix his glitch with the help of his new friends Hi-5 (voiced by James Corden) and a notorious codebreaker emoji named Jailbreak (Anna Faris). Meanwhile, Gene's parents, who are also \\"meh\\" emojis, set out to find their missing son as the smartphone owner, Alex, schedules to have his phone wiped clean after various inopportune technical malfunctions. While the concept of exploring a digital world inside a device used daily by millions of people might seem intriguing, the film's plot goes nowhere. Instead of utilizing a clever narrative to navigate this imaginative environment, The Emoji Movie relies heavily on clichéd tropes and a predictable storyline that borrows heavily from previous successful animated films with similar concepts, such as \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" and \\"Inside Out.\\" Moreover, the characters in the movie are underdeveloped and unengaging. Gene's solely defined by his \\"glitch\\" rather than any memorable qualities, making it difficult for audiences to root for him or empathize with his struggles for self-acceptance. The supporting characters, like the overly enthusiastic Hi-5 and the tired stereotype Jailbreak (the \\"rebellious\\" female character fighting societal norms), are equally forgettable despite the film's attempts at creating a sense of camaraderie and excitement. One of the most glaring issues with the film, however, is the blatant and excessive product placement that peppers the already dull storyline. From a prolonged scene in the app Candy Crush to a visit to the worlds of Spotify, Just Dance, and Instagram, the film misses opportunities for genuine humor and storytelling and instead reduces itself to a thinly veiled advertisement for multiple brands and popular apps. This product-driven approach detracts further from the film's potential emotional depth or connection with its audience. The Emoji Movie's subpar graphics and animation, coupled with a lackluster voice cast led by T.J. Miller, ultimately failed to bring any level of emotion or engagement to the film, further solidifying its status as a box office flop and disappointing fans and critics alike. In conclusion, The Emoji Movie is a glaring example of wasted potential and serves as a reminder that relying on trends, clichés, and excessive product placement will not save a poorly developed story or characters. It's a missed opportunity to create entertainment and meaningful content from a potentially fascinating concept, leaving audiences unsurprised by its negative reception and lack of box office success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The study, conducted by neuroscientists  and psychologist from the University of Maryland, concluded that women talked more because they had more of the Foxp2 protein. The research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found that higher levels were found among humans that were women but in rats that were males. Their findings came after it was previously claimed that ladies speak about 20,000 words a day - over 13,000 more than men. \\"This study is one of the first to report a sex difference in the expression of a language-associated protein in humans or animals,\\" said Prof Margaret McCarthy, who led the study. In their study, the researchers attempted to determine what might make male rats more vocal than their female friends. They separated four-day-old rats from their mothers and then counted the number of times they cried out in the \\"ultrasonic range\\", the frequencies higher than humans can hear, over five minutes. While both sexes called out hundreds of cries, the males called out twice as often, they found. But when the pups were returned to their mother's cage, she _ her sons first. Tests conducted on the parts of the brain known to be associated with vocalcalls showed the male pups have up to twice as much Foxp2 protein as the females. The researchers then increased the production in the brains of female pups and reduced it in males. This led to the female rats crying out more often and their mothers showing more interest to them. In contrast, males became less \\"talkative\\". The researchers then tested samples from ten children, aged between three and five, which showed that females had up to 30 per cent more of the Foxp2 protein than males, in a brain area key to language in humans. \\"Based on our observations, we assume higher levels of Foxp2 in girls and higher levels of Foxp2 in male rats is an indication that Foxp2 protein levels are associated with the more communicative sex,\\"...

Their imaginations often got the better of them, leading Debbie to recall playing Ouija with Isabelle inside the Galardi's massive, creaky attic during one particularly memorable sleepover. The planchette seemed to move on its own accord, and both girls were equally frightened and thrilled by the mysterious spirit they believed they were speaking to. That night, both girls vowed never to forget the spirit they met that evening on the Ouija board. Time passed, and Debbie and Isabelle grew older. Their childhood games of contacting the other side began to seem like silly distractions from their increasingly busy lives. Eventually, they found themselves in college, and their bond still remained strong. On the last day of finals, Debbie invited Isabelle, along with their other friends, Pete and Laine, to unwind and celebrate the end of another semester. Unbeknownst to the others, Debbie had kept that old Ouija board stored away in the back of her closet as a reminder of her cherished childhood memories. During a lull in the conversation, Debbie brought out the dusty Ouija board as a nostalgic joke. None of them realized they were about to make contact with the very spirit Debbie and Isabelle had encountered years before. As the planchette began to move on its own, just as it had long ago, Debbie was flooded with dread. She impulsively threw the board across the room, ending the impromptu séance and terrorizing those gathered. The board landed unnoticed in the corner, but the energy from the other side still lurked, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Much to everyone's horror, the malicious presence lingered in the room after the candles were blown out. It unexpectedly gained strength, smashing Pete's hand and face into the large mirror that hung on the wall, shattering the glass and wreaking havoc among the friends. All their laughter and light-heartedness dissipated, replaced by shock, fear, and pain as they rushed to aid their injured friend, Pete. In the following days, eerie incidents occurred which left the friends questioning their reality. Hi Friend, the same phrase that the spirit had spelled out on the Ouija board during their childhood encounter, began appearing in unexpected places. Isabelle discovered the phrase etched into her wooden desk, Pete found it written on his wrist in his own handwriting, and Laine noticed the phrase on her computer screen one morning as she opened her laptop. This sense of foreboding began to take a toll on the group and isolated them from the world around them. They knew they had to find out more about the spirit who seemed to be wreaking havoc on their lives. Desperate, Laine and Debbie dove head-first into research, hoping to uncover any useful information about the spirit and how to fight it. Eventually, they stumbled upon the story of a little girl named Doris Zander, who belonged to the previous family that lived in Debbie's house. Digging further, they learned that the Zander family was plagued by misfortunes, and some suspected that little Doris was at the center of these tragedies, perhaps as the vessel or the unfortunate victim.  As the friends connected the dots, they realized that the spirit's intentions were far more sinister than they initially thought. Driven by fear and a desire to protect themselves and each other, they resolved to unravel the mystery of Doris Zander and her connection to the malevolent force that threatened their lives. United as friends once more, Debbie, Isabelle, Pete, and Laine found the strength to confront the darkness they'd unknowingly unleashed through that old, dusty Ouija board, and began a journey to free the little girl's spirit and save their own lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) The PRO , which is a \`\` null DP '' is in the subject position of the embedded clause . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but they use slightly different terminology to describe the same linguistic concept. Both sentences are referring to the \\"PRO\\" element, which is a type of unpronounced subject in certain embedded clauses. Let's analyze both sentences in detail: 1. The first sentence describes the PRO as a \\"zero-DP,\\" which stands for \\"zero determiner phrase.\\" This term implies that the PRO is an unpronounced or empty constituent serving as the subject in an embedded clause. The use of \\"zero\\" indicates that the element usually has no overt phonetic realization, and it cannot be explicitly heard or seen in speech or writing. In linguistic analysis, empty categories like zero-DP are often used to account for certain grammatical and syntactic phenomena. 2. The second sentence uses the term \\"null DP\\" instead of \\"zero-DP.\\" The word \\"null\\" serves the same purpose as \\"zero\\" in this context, as it signifies the absence of an overt phonetic form. Both \\"zero\\" and \\"null\\" are common ways of describing an element that is not overtly realized in a given sentence structure. This sentence also states that the PRO serves as the subject of the embedded clause, aligning it with the meaning expressed in the first sentence. In summary, both sentences describe the same linguistic concept, specifically, the unpronounced or empty subject known as PRO in certain embedded clauses.

This distinction between the two individuals' enjoyment of puzzles can be attributed to several factors related to their creativity levels, personal preferences, and cognitive function. Firstly, let's understand why Sarah's creativity makes puzzles exciting for her. Creativity often involves the ability to connect disparate concepts, solve problems, and think outside the box. For someone like Sarah, puzzles provide the perfect opportunity to exercise her mental prowess. Puzzles challenge her to analyze patterns, develop strategies, and adapt her thinking to overcome obstacles. As a creative person, Sarah likely finds pleasure in the process of problem-solving, iterating on her solutions, and finally discovering the correct path to complete the puzzle. In contrast, Emily's lack of excitement for puzzles might stem from her not being as creative a person. While she may possess other strengths and interests, the world of puzzles may not hold as much appeal for her because she does not derive the same level of satisfaction from solving them as Sarah does. It is possible that Emily enjoys activities that require different cognitive strengths or those that cater to her specific interests and talents. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of creativity are often considered to possess traits such as curiosity, persistence, and openness to new experiences. These characteristics could explain why Sarah finds puzzles so engaging – her inherently curious nature drives her to explore and uncover new challenges, while her persistence enables her to persevere even when the puzzles become difficult. At the same time, her openness to new experiences may lead her to appreciate the variety and novelty of different types of puzzles. On the other hand, Emily may possess a different set of traits. If she is more inclined towards structured thinking, routine, or well-defined activities, puzzles that require thinking beyond the bounds of traditional problem-solving might not appeal to her. It is worth mentioning that personal preferences and interests play a significant role in determining how much one enjoys a particular activity, and differing tastes between Sarah and Emily could explain their contrasting perspectives on puzzles. In conclusion, puzzles are exciting for Sarah and not Emily, largely due to Sarah being a creative person. Sarah's creativity provides her with the cognitive tools and innate curiosity that make puzzles an enjoyable and stimulating activity, while Emily's lack of excitement may be attributed to her preference for other pursuits or a different cognitive skill set. Both Sarah and Emily are unique individuals, and their interests and aptitudes are shaped by a combination of personal traits, cognitive abilities, and individual experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.  A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo.  Which markalong was produced asexually? A:","output":"The markalong that was produced asexually is animal A. As mentioned in the provided information, animal A has only one parent, indicating asexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, the offspring inherit the genetic information solely from one parent and are genetically identical to that parent. On the other hand, animal B has two parents and inherited a mix of traits from both, suggesting sexual reproduction took place in its case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Should you marry a girl who had a boyfriend in the past ? Should you marry a girl who has been in a relationship? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions are similar but not exactly the same. The first question asks if one should marry a girl who had a boyfriend in the past, and the second question asks if one should marry a girl who has been in a relationship. While both questions address the issue of a girl's previous relationship experience, the second question is broader since it generalizes about any past relationship, which could include boyfriends, girlfriends, or any other type of romantic or intimate connection. Evaluating whether to marry a person based on their past relationships could be a subjective decision that depends on individual values and beliefs. However, it's important to remember that evaluating a potential spouse should be based on various factors regarding the person's character and compatibility with oneself rather than merely focusing on their past relationships. Here are a few essential aspects to consider: 1. Compatibility: Assess if you and your potential spouse share similar values, beliefs, and interests, and if you both enjoy each other's company. A relationship built on compatibility forms a stronger foundation for marriage than a person's past relationship history. 2. Trust: Establishing trust is of utmost importance in any relationship. If you find it challenging to trust the person because of their past relationships, you should evaluate whether the issue stems from an insecurity within you or the person's behavior in the present context. If they have moved on from their past, learned from those experiences, and have demonstrated trustworthiness since then, it may not be fair to judge them solely based on the past. 3. Emotional baggage: People who have had past relationships might carry some emotional baggage, but it is essential to remember that everyone has a past, and we all have made mistakes and grown from them. The key is to understand whether the person has come to terms with their past, overcome any emotional baggage, and is ready to commit to a new chapter in life with you. 4. Personal growth: It is vital to consider whether the person has grown as an individual since their past relationships. If they have learned from their experiences, matured emotionally and mentally, and made positive changes, it is not fair to penalize them for a past relationship.  5. Communication: Open and honest communication is a pillar of any successful relationship. If concerns about the person's past relationships arise, it is crucial to have a mature and non-judgmental conversation about it. Understand the context of their past, what they learned from it, and ensure that both parties are genuinely committed to moving forward together. In conclusion, marrying someone who has had a previous relationship or a boyfriend/girlfriend in the past should not be a deal-breaker. Instead, focus on other essential aspects such as compatibility, trust, emotional baggage, personal growth, and communication. Remember, it is the present and the future that matter the most when building a life together, and a person's past relationships should not overshadow the potential for a successful and fulfilling marriage if they have genuinely evolved and grown from their experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process. When more mold forms into a colony, it leads to greater growth, biomass, and presence of the mold on the piece of bread. This has a direct impact on the number of sporangiophores growing upward, as more mold in a colony would lead to more nutrient absorption and a larger colony size, resulting in an increase in sporangiophores production. The development and growth of sporangiophores are a significant part of the mold's reproductive process, as they bear spore-producing structures (sporangia) that release spores into the environment. When more mold develops into a colony, the mold has a higher capacity to create and support additional sporangiophores. This means that the perturbation in this case is likely to result in a higher number of sporangiophores growing upward, enabling the mold to produce and disperse more spores throughout the environment, further propagating its presence. In addition, the increased growth of sporangiophores can have indirect effects on the mold's colonization process. As more sporangiophores grow upward and release more spores into the environment, this increases the chances of these spores landing on and colonizing other surfaces where they can access nutrients and continue growing. This self-perpetuating cycle results in an enhanced capability for the mold to spread and colonize new areas, thriving on the nutrient-rich surfaces they encounter. In conclusion, an increase in mold forming into a colony does affect more sporangiophores growing upward as it leads to increased nutrient absorption, larger colony size, and greater potential for reproduction. Consequently, this perturbation results in both direct and indirect effects on the mold's colonization and reproductive processes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October. Backed with \\"Mister Pleasant\\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group....

Write a title for this article: It's finally getting warm outside, so your first instinct may be to pour a glass of the lighter chardonnay or sauvignon blanc wines to go with the milder weather. But what if you really enjoy your reds? Any time I ever asked someone to help me learn about wine, the response is always, drink what you like. So, if you like red, drink it --all summer. We talked with sommelier and wine blogger Dwight Casimere, AKA the Wine Doctor, about pairing your favorite reds with your summertime foods. Casimere, a long-time food and wine writer, offered this: What types of red wine could you pair with seafood or salads? Casimere: There are a variety of pinot noirs, fruitier merlots, light bodied Italian reds and certainly a stunning array of rosé that go terrifically with fish. In the south of France, for example, it’s not uncommon to see the lighter red wines of the region served lightly chilled. Casimere:A Tempranillo [wine] from Spain, a Zinfandel from California or a hearty Barolo from Italy are matches made in Heaven. Fresh off a trip to Italy, Casimere brought the Scacciadiavoli Rosso di Montefalco, which retails for about 23 and the Nipozzano Riserva Marchesi de Frescobaldi, which is made from that fabulous Tuscan Sangiovese grape and sells for about 19. If you have to pick a white, what are some of your favorites for a spring or summer barbecue? Casimere: Pinot Grigio is number one. Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine from the northeastern part of Italy is another terrific choice. He brought the Arnaldo Caprai Grecante Grechetto from Umbria, Italy, 19, and the Adega do Monte Branco Alento Branco, from the Alentejano region of Portugal, 14.

When Amanda Knox was convicted again on Thursday, Americans reacted with bafflement. The appeal was the third round through Italy's grinding, multi-level legal system, with its numerous checks and balances. But the saga is also confusing because, while the crime is simple, the case built around it is a grand spectacle combining aspects of national pride, sexist archetypes and race. Knox and her co-defendant, Raffaele Sollecito, were first convicted by a jury in 2009 for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007. An appellate judge overturned the conviction in 2011 and Knox returned to the United States after four years in jail. The prosecutor then appealed the acquittal to the Italian Supreme Court, which sent the case to the new appellate panel that reinstated the conviction. From that interview and many more, I pieced together a picture of a young man who seemed to be acting out some sort of fantasy of a home, a fantasy that perhaps abruptly cracked when OPTIONS: - Amanda Knox came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Americans came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - British came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Burleigh came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Italian came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Italy came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Knox came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Meredith Kercher came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Nina Burleigh came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Raffaele Sollecito came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Rudy Guede came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Supreme Court came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - United States came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him.","output":"- Meredith Kercher came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What makes for 'creative teaching'? What makes you creative? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"While both questions revolve around the concept of creativity, they address different subjects – one is focused on creative teaching, specifically in the context of the education field, while the second question is more general, asking about what makes an individual creative. To provide a more comprehensive answer, both concepts – creative teaching and individual creativity – will be explored separately. Creative teaching refers to the use of imaginative and innovative techniques and strategies to convey information and educate in a way that promotes active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It breaks free from traditional teaching methodologies, striving to engage and inspire students by creating a more immersive and meaningful learning experience. There are several factors that contribute to making teaching creative: 1. Flexibility: Creative teaching involves adapting and modifying lesson plans, methodologies, and practices to suit the unique needs and interests of the students. Educators should be willing to explore new ideas and experiment with different methods to keep the learning experience fresh and relevant. 2. Personalization: Recognizing and catering to the individual learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses of each student is crucial in creative teaching. This may involve using various educational tools and resources to accommodate diverse learning needs, such as visual aids, interactive activities, group work, or individual tasks. 3. Interdisciplinary approach: Creative teaching often involves combining knowledge and concepts from multiple subject areas to paint a holistic picture and stimulate deeper understanding. This approach helps to reveal the connections between various topics, enhancing students' critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. 4. Active learning: Encouraging students to take a proactive role in the learning process is a key aspect of creative teaching. This can be achieved through inquiry-based learning, group projects, debates, or other interactive activities that promote collaboration and critical thinking. 5. Emphasis on problem-solving: Fostering a problem-solving mindset in students can help them to develop the skills needed to address complex and novel situations. Creative teaching may incorporate real-life problems and challenges to stimulate students' curiosity and provide opportunities for skill development. 6. Use of technology: Integrating technology into the classroom (e.g., computers, interactive whiteboards, tablets) can provide new avenues for creative teaching. Education technology can help to supplement traditional teaching methods and offer innovative and engaging ways for students to learn and explore new topics. Individual creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a person to create, invent, or discover new ideas, solutions, or artistic expressions by combining existing knowledge and resources in unique and original ways. Factors that contribute to individual creativity include: 1. Imagination: Creative individuals possess a vivid imagination that enables them to envision novel ideas and possibilities, transcending the boundaries of conventional thought. 2. Curiosity: A curious mindset drives creative individuals to explore new subjects, ask questions, and seek answers, constantly expanding their knowledge base. 3. Cognitive flexibility: The ability to shift perspectives, adapt to new situations, and discover unconventional solutions is essential for creativity. 4. Divergent thinking: Creative individuals are often skilled at divergent thinking, which involves generating multiple, varied solutions to a given problem or challenge. 5. Persistence: Creativity often requires persistence, allowing individuals to refine and hone their ideas over time in the face of setbacks and challenges. 6. Open-mindedness: Open-minded individuals are receptive to new experiences, ideas, and perspectives, which can contribute to their creative thinking. In conclusion, while creative teaching and individual creativity share common traits, such as flexibility, open-mindedness, and problem-solving, the two concepts refer to different contexts. Creative teaching specifically addresses the use of creative strategies in education, while individual creativity is a broader concept relating to one's ability to generate and express novel ideas and solutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Market analysts in the United States have recently been quoted as saying that the biggest threat to the luxury   industry in the US is the tech industry. This is according to an article by fellow journalist Ashley Lutz. Her suggestion is sound. The main idea of her article is that products from Tiffany & Co. find their biggest competition not from other luxury brands but from companies like Apple. Lutz points out that luxury products are often only for \\"show,\\" while the attraction behind tech products is functionality. You find few people in the United States today willing to purchase luxury goods at full price. It didn't use to be that way. Luxury goods used to be actually _ . That meant you needed to travel to the right store to purchase them, and you didn't even have the option of getting a deal. Today, no one wants to pay full price for luxury goods. People have the unfortunate belief that fakes   somehow are equal to originals, and if you can't get a deal on eBay, Amazon, or in an outlet store, purchasing a luxury product probably isn't worth it. Luxury brands struggle to remain high-end   images despite the reality that the American consumer is motivated much more by discounts than they are by brand names or image. Yet people stand in line to pay full price for a new product from Apple and crowds gather to hear about a new smart phone. While electronics are updating every day, people are purchasing technology at full prices much more than they are purchasing luxury goods. What are high-tech makers doing right that luxury makers are pitifully failing at? Carefully looking at the situation, it would appear as if the Internet didn't hurt the luxury industry, expectation from the consumers did. What people want these days more than anything is stuff that does something. They want cars that drive, shoes that are comfortable, games that are fun to play, screens that are beautiful to look at, tools that are useful, and entertainment that is entertaining. Little of that fits into what the luxury industry has... Question: What does this passage mainly talk about? - Nobody likes luxury goods any more. - Luxury goods are of poor quality nowadays. - Tech products become the new \\"luxury goods\\". - Iphones have taken the place of luxury products.

Solution:","output":"Task Explanation: The task is to describe a process that will lead to painting a survival container. The process should involve physical actions with objects and focus on physical knowledge about the world. Solution: Step 1: Gather the necessary materials Collect the required items such as the survival container, appropriate paint, paintbrushes or paint rollers, paint tray, drop cloth or old newspapers, painter's tape, sandpaper, and clean cloth. Step 2: Prepare the workspace Lay down the drop cloth or old newspapers in your designated painting area to protect the floor from any paint drips or spills. Ensure the workspace is well-ventilated to prevent inhaling paint fumes. Step 3: Clean the container Use a clean cloth to wipe the survival container thoroughly, removing any dirt, dust, or debris from the surface. This will ensure the paint adheres properly to the container. Step 4: Sand the container (if necessary) If the container's surface is glossy or has a finish that can prevent paint from adhering, lightly sand the entire surface with sandpaper to create a slightly rough texture for better paint adherence. Step 5: Apply painter's tape Use painter's tape to mask off any areas you do not want to paint, such as handles, hinges, or other hardware. This will help create clean lines and prevent paint from transferring to undesired areas. Step 6: Prepare the paint Pour the paint into the paint tray, and make sure to mix the paint thoroughly to ensure even color and consistency. Step 7: Apply the paint Dip the paintbrush or paint roller into the paint tray, removing any excess paint. Apply the paint in even strokes or rolls, covering the entire surface of the container. Be sure not to overload the brush or roller, as this can cause paint drips or uneven coverage. Step 8: Allow the paint to dry Follow the paint manufacturer's instructions for drying times, ensuring the paint has dried fully before proceeding. Step 9: Apply additional coats (if necessary) If the container requires more coverage, you can apply additional coats of paint. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Step 10: Remove the painter's tape Once the final coat of paint has dried, carefully remove the painter's tape from the container. Step 11: Allow the paint to cure Give the painted container time to cure fully as per the paint manufacturer's recommendations. This may take up to several days, depending on the paint used. Step 12: Store the survival container Once the paint has fully cured, your survival container is ready for use. Store it safely in a desired location.

The review mentions two key aspects to support this conclusion:  1. \\"Flat script\\" - When someone refers to a script as \\"flat,\\" it usually implies that the plot is lacking in depth and complexity, or that the dialogue is uninspired or boring. It may also suggest that the storytelling does not engage the audience or evoke strong emotions. 2. \\"Low budget\\" - Mentioning a low budget typically implies that the production values are lower than average, which can negatively affect the movie's overall impression. A low budget may limit the resources available for crucial aspects such as special effects, set design, costume design, and casting. While budget does not necessarily determine the quality of the movie, noting the budgetary constraints might suggest that the reviewer perceived a lack of polish or detail in the film. By focusing on these negative aspects, the reviewer seems to express dissatisfaction and a unfavorable view of the movie.

He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab. I would not have pretended it wasn’t happening, or “not that bad” or other form of denial. As is, I lived through this hell for two years, and a part of me will never forgive for how it all came about. Probably TMI, sorry. Becky Question: Becky probably believes her children feel that she: Answer: A:","output":"Becky probably believes her children feel that she was an accomplice to their abuse. This belief might have arisen from her perception that, as their mother, she failed to shield them from the harmful effects of her step-son's addictive behavior and the associated violent threats. Her reflection on the past events indicates significant remorse and guilt over her perceived inability to effectively stand against her step-son's conduct. Despite the aggressive behavior of her step-son, her husband's overwhelming desire to save his son might have inadvertently forced her into a passive role of allowing the abuse to persist. This might have made her children see her as an accomplice, given her apparent lack of resistance or action against the abusive step-son. Furthermore, her contemplation about what she would've done if her own children were the abusers, envisaging a firm decision to put them into long-term rehab and not living in denial, might reflect her regret about not taking a stronger stance. Therefore, Becky's feeling suggests that she believes her children might view her as a complicit in their own victimization, marked by her perceived inactivity during the abusive episodes they endured. It's important to note that, despite this self-perception, Becky's narrative indicates she was also a victim in the situation, caught between a desire to protect her children and the need to accommodate her husband's approach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ms Mattinson told BBC Sunday Politics she was \\"very concerned\\" lessons from the election would not be learned. Labour said the Beckett report had \\"consulted far and wide\\". Ms Mattinson, whose research was conducted in marginal constituencies such as Croydon, Watford, Nuneaton and Glasgow, insists she had briefed Dame Margaret before the release of her report. \\"I was somewhat disappointed not to see some of that reflected back,\\" she said. \\"Yes, she picked up on the economy, but there actually was no analysis. It's reduced down to one bullet point in the report.\\" She added that it was \\"quite apologetic, lots of defensive stuff in there but nothing that really shone a light on what had gone wrong\\". \\"I feel very concerned that these lessons won't be learned,\\" she said. \\"I can't see how they will be learned, because [the report] was the vehicle, that was the moment and if this report didn't address those issues then I am not sure when they will be addressed.\\" She added: \\"No political party has a divine right to exist and unless Labour really listens to those people it must persuade, it stands no chance of winning the next election.\\" The report did say that Labour faced a \\"huge challenge\\" to win again in 2020. Overseen by the former Cabinet minister, Dame Margaret, it summarised four main reasons for Labour's defeat, indicating: The report also said assumptions that Labour lost the election because it was too left-wing and because its policies were unpopular was overly simplistic and should be treated with caution, adding that the manifesto was an \\"impressive document.\\" Labour said the Beckett report had \\"consulted far and wide\\", taking input from pollsters, pundits and academics.","output":"Deborah Mattinson, a political strategist who conducted voter research for the Labour Party, expressed disappointment that her findings were not included in Dame Margaret Beckett's report on the party's 2019 election loss. Mattinson's research, carried out in marginal constituencies, focused on understanding the reasons for the defeat. She claimed her evidence was not published and the report lacked a proper analysis of the problems that led to the loss. Instead, it highlighted four main reasons, which Mattinson believed were oversimplified. She warned that if Labour did not learn from its mistakes, it would struggle to win future elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I've slogged through a couple of his self-indulgent works now, and from what I can see, he's an author because he says so. Unfortunately he's not alone; the people with egos big enough to believe they are something are granted celebrity or at least book contracts just because they have the hutzpah to tell the world what every person's mama made him or her believe for a while: I'm special. Most people grow up and realize that everyone is special but nobody's really THAT special. Pollack seems to still believe that he is not one of the very folk he attempts so weakly to satirize, a pompous bag of air who should be penalized for every tree that dies in the service of his vanity. He's an average writer with average opinions and really should take a breath and realize he's OK without being \\"special.\\" Then he should give the reading public a break and get a real job. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the author Pollack and his works, describing them as \\"self-indulgent\\" and \\"average.\\" The reviewer criticizes Pollack's sense of self-importance, suggesting that he believes himself to be more special than he actually is. They also imply that by receiving book deals and celebrity status solely due to his audacity to call himself an author, Pollack is part of a broader societal issue where people are granted undeserved recognition. The reviewer uses strong language and negative descriptors to convey their disappointment, such as \\"pompous bag of air\\" and stating that Pollack should be \\"penalized for every tree that dies in the service of his vanity.\\" Additionally, they argue that Pollack should accept his averageness, stop writing, and find a different job. Overall, the review portrays a disapproving and negative opinion of both the author and his works, suggesting that readers should avoid his writing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. You are given a new situation: Two continents were separated by a large ocean. Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters.  and a hint : On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.  Please answer this question : Which continent experienced more tornadoes?","output":"Based on the given information, the continent of Oceania experienced more common weather phenomena, which include tornadoes as a less common event.

He has a record of stalking daughters.\\" Mr Modi had, in his monthly radio address to the nation, asked people to send in selfies with their daughters. He is fronting a movement to save and educate girl children in the country. The tag #SelfieWithDaughter had begun trending soon after Mr Modi's radio address ended, with over 20,000 people submitting pictures. A small village in Haryana had begun the campaign, asking people to send in selfies with their daughters to win a prize. Over 800 people had participated in the initiative. Ms Krishnan's tweet enraged Mr Modi's supporters on Twitter, who tweeted back at her, condemning her for her remarks. The sheer volume of tweets directed at her and referencing her, meant that Ms Krishnan's name began trending on Twitter, along with  #SelfieWithDaughter and #MannKiBaat which is the name of the prime minister's radio show. Many of the tweets were highly abusive, sometimes accompanied with threats of violence. Ms Krishnan has taken to retweeting some of the most offensive. Ms Krishnan told BBC Hindi that she \\"welcomed\\" these reactions because they \\"expose the mindset of these men who are actually anti-women\\". She said she did not feel isolated or scared since she had also received a lot of support with Twitter users pointing out that the stream of abuse directed at the activist contradicted the #SelfieWithDaughter tag, that many of them had been using. Ms Krishnan was not the only high-profile woman attacking Mr Modi's new initiative. Actress Shruti Seth also delivered a salvo of scathing tweets at the prime minister, asking him to \\"be more than a photograph\\". Like Ms Krishnan, Ms Seth was also at the receiving end of a wave of online abuse. She retweeted some of the more offensive ones and responded to a few. Mr Modi has a huge army of online followers, who fight many battles on his behalf, and react violently to any criticism of him. They were particularly active during his successful election campaign in 2014. Ms Krishnan's tweet was in reference to a 2013 incident entitled \\"snoopgate\\" by local media. Two news outlets said they had accessed audio recordings containing telephone conversations in which the president of the ruling BJP Amit Shah (then general secretary) was directing the illegal surveillance of a young woman in 2009. According to the recordings, the surveillance of the woman had been ordered by someone called \\"saheb\\" (sir) which was assumed to be a reference to Mr Modi, who was then the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat. The matter of illegal surveillance was taken up by the Supreme Court, which directed the petitioner to drop the \\"scandalous charges\\" against the prime minister. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Ms. Krishnan, a woman from India, wrote a tweet about being careful with sharing selfies with daughters and the Prime Minister, Mr. Modi. The Prime Minister had asked people to send selfies with their daughters as part of a movement to save and educate girl children in India. Many people shared their pictures. But after Ms. Krishnan's tweet, some of Mr. Modi's supporters got very angry. They sent lots of mean messages to her on Twitter. Some even threatened her. She shared some of the meanest messages, saying they show how some men don't really support women. Ms. Krishnan and an actress named Shruti Seth criticized the Prime Minister's movement. They faced a lot of online abuse, but also got support from other people on Twitter. The Prime Minister has many online followers who react strongly to any criticism of him. Ms. Krishnan's tweet was about an incident in 2013, where Mr. Modi was said to be spying on a young woman.

At a St. Louis opera house in 1860, a singer in blackface named Jerry Barton, known as \\"King of the Minstrels\\", comes backstage and asks his sweetheart, Lettie Morgan, to elope. Lettie's Aunt Hortense, fearing that Barton is a fortune hunter, tells Lettie she is not the heiress she thought she was and that she has been living off her aunt's charity. With no fortune to hunt, Barton informs Lettie that an artist cannot be burdened with the responsibility of a wife. Outside the opera house, Lettie meets a chorus girl named Honey, who is preparing to leave with her theatrical troupe in a caravan heading West. When the troupe's producer mistakes Lettie for the star, she joins the group as \\"Mary Varden\\". The troupe's wagon train is escorted by Captain Tex Autry of the U.S. Cavalry and his singing plainsmen. The troupe misses the wagon train, however, and must travel alone. On their way to San Francisco, the caravan is ambushed by a gang of thieves. Tex and his men arrive on the scene and following a gunfight, the gang is chased off. After Tex saves Lettie from a runaway wagon, he comments on the foolishness of risking his men's lives for a bunch of \\"crazy showgirls\\".

Solve this instance: The Democratic partyâs strategy for responding to  the Al Franken scandal  is now apparent: Taking up Frankenâs own hint in  his  apology statement  there will be an âEthics Committee investigation.â Investigate what  Senate Clouseaus?  Franken  has been caught on film. When Los Angeles radio host Leeann Tweeden said that during a 2006 USO tour  Franken  used  his  position as an entertainer to rope her into kissing  him  in the guise of a rehearsal for a sketch  that was repellent enough. Franken âput his hand on the back of my head  mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth â Tweeden said  and  Franken  offered no specific alternative story  only a lame suggestion that âI donât remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does.â Is the Senate Ethics Committee going to invite Tweeden in to tell her story and try to nail down exactly what  Franken  claims happened? Is the Senate Ethics Committee going to issue an open call to any other women out there who may have similar claims about  Franken  to submit their testimony? I doubt it. The purpose of this phony investigation is to give the appearance of doing something while allowing time to pass and tempers to cool  on the way to administering some meaningless reprimand to  Franken .  Franken  might be able to shake this off if  he  could depend on conflicting memories. But  he  canât. Because of that photo. The sex-abuse scandal is becoming  to cultural history  what Watergate was to political history. It is gigantic. It is era-defining. And among the dozens of famous people implicated in it  the  Franken  photo is the most damning and irrefutable evidence yet to emerge. Itâs a tableau of our time. It is the photo of our moment. Itâs the kind of smoking gun you couldnât use in a Law & Order episode because it would be too blatant. It will never disappear from the national consciousness. Consider the breathtaking way each detail reinforces the horror of the others: A Hollywood celebrity who will soon be a Democratic senator is molesting a woman. While sheâs asleep. And in military gear  because sheâs traveling to support our troops. In a war zone. And  Franken  is smiling. While shamelessly posing for the photographer. How can we ever cease to be amazed and appalled by this photo? It is to the sex war what the picture of the summary execution of that Viet Cong prisoner was to the Vietnam War. Yet as the Senate circles the wagons around  Franken   itâs liberals and Democrats who should be angry â not Republicans. To Republicans itâs Thanksgiving come early. It makes no difference to the Republican policy agenda whether  Franken  or some other generic liberal Democrat holds that seat. If  Franken  remains  Roy Mooreâs chances of victory in Alabama increase. It makes it too easy for Republicans in Alabama to say  âWait a minute  weâre supposed to end the career of Roy Moore  a legend in this state  when Democrats wonât expel  Franken ? Why should we agree to unilateral ethics enforcement?â Should Moore make it to the Senate  Democrats will be able to cast Republicans as the party of sex creeps only if they expel  Franken . Every time Mooreâs name is mentioned  the response will be  âWhat about  Al Franken ? And by the way  what about Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy?â True  in a certain sense this isnât fair. What Moore probably did is worse than what  Franken  admitted doing. But politics isnât fair. Whataboutism and crying hypocrisy arenât very strong moral arguments  but theyâre easy to make and theyâre emotionally satisfying. And a photograph of obvious wrongdoing simply carries more salience than a verbal allegation â even if the allegation is credible and even if the behavior alleged is worse than that seen in the photo. Democrats who just this week were saying they would no longer tolerate Bill Clintonâtype behavior can prove it. They can make a clear break with the past by saying no more sexual misbehavior will be tolerated  even by beloved party members. They could then leverage that moral clarity in 2018 to seek the votes of the married women who are wary about the liberal agenda but might be persuadable. Instead  theyâre protecting their own. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand either can position herself as Americaâs leading tribune for women victimized by sexual assault or she can support keeping  Franken  in the Senate  but not both. Her initial gambit â  his  apology isnât enough but âI expect to hear moreâ from Franken â is insufficient. What more is there for  Franken  to say now that  he  has admitted guilt and apologized? The Democrats are creating a three-word weapon with which the GOP will never stop beating them over the head: What. About. Franken.

A ‘Pitch,’ a swing, a miss This new drama imagines what it might be like for the first woman in Major League Baseball. Kylie Bunbury plays a pitcher who faces the sexism of sports culture and the pressure of being a groundbreaker. Early on, she overhears the guys trash-talking her through the vent system in the clubhouse. “She’s a gimmick,” the team captain (played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar) says with contempt. Meanwhile, her super-aggressive agent (Ali Larter) works hard to milk the moment. I wish this show were better, and less superficial, especially at a moment when another woman may be making headway in another male-dominated institution: the presidency. From Dan Fogelman, who’s also behind this season’s new “This Is Us” on NBC, the story relies far too heavily on clichés, obvious points, stereotypical characters, and, despite the approval and participation of Major League Baseball, an unrealistic atmosphere. That vent system bit, for example. Did the writers really need to give us that scene? Or, if they really had to re-re-emphasize the male players’ resistance to their new teammate, couldn’t they have come up with something better than the old heard-it-through-the-vent trick? It’s network laziness at its laziest. Bunbury is good enough, in a somewhat muted and interior way, but the script doesn’t ask much of her. And she is surrounded by shallow performances. Each actor seems to be playing only one note. There’s a twist at the end of the pilot, just as there was a twist at the end of “This Is Us,” and I won’t spoil it here. But I will say that it didn’t have its desired effect, which was to make me well up with tears. My eyes did do something, however: They rolled.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Dane DeHaan played the title character in which 2017 3D film written by Luc Besson? A:","output":"Dane DeHaan played the title character in the 2017 3D film \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,\\" which was written and directed by Luc Besson. This science-fiction film is based on the French comic book series \\"Valérian and Laureline\\" by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières. The film's story follows the adventures of the two main characters, Valerian (played by Dane DeHaan) and Laureline (played by Cara Delevingne), who are special operatives tasked with maintaining order throughout the human territories. The plot of \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\\" revolves around the duo's mission to the metropolis of Alpha, an ever-expanding city known for its diverse array of species and cultures from different planets. In the movie, they are assigned to investigate a dark force that poses a grave threat to the peace and unity of Alpha. As they uncover the true nature of this threat, they also come across the larger conspiracy that may endanger the entire universe. Luc Besson, a renowned French filmmaker with a penchant for visually stunning and stylistic movies, adapted the screenplay for this film. He had been a fan of the Valérian comic series since his teenage years and had long desired to bring the story to the big screen. It took him almost a decade and advancements in filmmaking technology to finally realize his vision for this project. One significant aspect of \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\\" is the high-quality visual effects and 3D elements, which make it an immersive and breathtaking experience for the audience. The movie enlisted the expertise of Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, and Rodeo FX, among others, to create the stunning visuals that brought the futuristic world of Alpha and its inhabitants to life. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's visuals and action sequences yet found shortcomings in its storytelling and character development, \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\\" remains a notable entry in the genre of science fiction cinema. In playing the lead role of Valerian, Dane DeHaan further expanded his diverse portfolio of work in film, demonstrating his ability to take on a wide range of roles as an actor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him.

In Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Treasure Island', what is the name of the sinister blind pirate?","output":"In Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Treasure Island', the name of the sinister blind pirate is Pew. He is a supporting antagonist in the novel and is initially introduced as a blind beggar who serves as a messenger and recruiter for the pirate Captain Flint. Pew is a fearsome figure despite his blindness, characterized by his scraggly appearance, malevolence, and cruelty. As a skilled criminal, he uses his disability to his advantage, instilling fear and demanding respect from those around him. He carries a stick made of whalebone, which he utilizes as a weapon and for guidance, tapping the ground as he navigates his surroundings. Pew is first encountered when he delivers the Black Spot, a pirate summons marked with a black spot on one side and a message on the other, to a former member of Flint's crew named Billy Bones. The Black Spot is a pirate symbol of impending doom, in this case, a warning from Flint's former crewmates who are after the treasure map entrusted to Bones. Pew's actions eventually lead to the events of the story, as young Jim Hawkins finds the treasure map among Bones's belongings and embarks on an adventure along with Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and other important characters. Pew meets his demise towards the end of the novel when, after a failed attempt at acquiring the treasure map from Dr. Livesey and the other protagonists, he is accidentally trampled to death by a group of horsemen who come to the rescue.

Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China. It came to an end when all political power was unified under the Tokugawa shogunate.  - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states.  - Shinmen Sokan ( active 16th century ) was a Japanese lord , daimyo of the Shinmen clan (  Shinmen - shi ) during the middle of the Sengoku period . Sokan was known as a rather petty daimyo in the mountainous regions of Sakushu , which was west of Kyoto . Even though this was so , the Shinmen clan had very good ties with that of the Hirata family , leading to the Shinmen receiving a good amount of support . One such swordsman of note that served under Sokan was the famous Shinmen Munisai , the father of the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi . In 1589 , Sokan ordered Munisai to kill Honiden Gekinosuke ( a minor student under Munisai ) for unknown reasons . Due to this fact however , Munisai was forced to leave his village of Miyamoto .  - , also known as Shinmen Takez, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Draku, was an expert Japanese swordsman and rnin.

Legend tells that he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from shima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor would later describe it as \\"Musken\\" (), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Musken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin.  - A was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period (11851868) of Japan.

My neck gets tight and achy, and I can't think as clearly as usual, like my mental gears are gummed up. That slow-brain feeling, I've learned over the years, is not a good sign. It means I'm about to get a migraine. It's my cue to be careful—to steer clear of red wine and sugar, two sure triggers when I'm in that sensitive state, and to get enough rest since lack of sleep can tip me over the edge, too. Even so, if anything in my routine is out of whack—if I don't eat often enough, or if I become overly stressed—I can count on one or two days of misery. Head-pounding, nauseated, verge-of-tears misery. Sound bad? Compared to many of the 30 million migraine sufferers in the U.S., my experience is fairly mild. Several years ago, the massive American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study found that half of those who struggle with migraines can't do household chores and a third forgo family or social activities. That's a whole lot of agony, and it affects three times as many women as men, largely because the ups and downs of our hormones seem to make us more susceptible, according to Dr. Andrew Charles, professor and director of the UCLA School of Medicine's Headache Research and Treatment Program. A migraine isn't just a headache; it's a neurological disorder, often inherited, in which triggers ranging from stress to certain foods to even changes in the weather set off a chain reaction in the brain that results in intense pain. Most migraine sufferers are between the ages of 20 and 50—women in full-speed-ahead career/family/juggling mode. We're talking about multitaskers who definitely can't afford a day or two (or more) of feeling cruddy. And yet most don't get effective treatment, even though there are plenty of options. \\"Many people still don't know what migraines are or that there's good help available,\\" said Dr. Stewart Tepper, a headache specialist at the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Headache and Pain. In fact, many women don't even realize that they've got migraines in the first place. The truth is, most bad headaches—the ones that make getting through the day a chore or make you feel nauseated or sensitive to light—are the Big M. \\"They're more common than we used to think,\\" Charles said. \\"Nearly 48 percent of all women will have a migraine at some point in their lives.\\" Although tension headaches affect more people, they're far less debilitating and easier to deal with. Studies have found that most people who complain to their doctors about headaches have migraines—as do nearly 90 percent of people who think they have sinus headaches. That's why it's so important to understand migraines—why we get them, what triggers them, how to prevent them, and the most effective ways to treat them at every stage. The best migraine defense is a good offense—stopping it before it starts. \\"One of the most effective things you can do is maintain regular habits and try to keep your life on an even keel,\\" said Dr. Peter Goadsby, director of the University of California–San Francisco Headache Clinic. Eat, sleep, and exercise regularly (studies have shown that both cardio and stretching are effective at reducing headaches), and try to control your stress, since that is the number-one migraine trigger. Lifestyle changes. Two options proven to help: biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy. With biofeedback training, technicians attach electrodes to your head and neck to measure muscle tension and relaxation, so you not only learn to recognize those states but to control them. And in cognitive behavioral therapy, you learn relaxation strategies, like meditation. \\"You get about a 55 percent reduction in headache frequency, on average, with behavioral approaches,\\" said Donald Penzien, director of the Head Pain Center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, \\"so long as you make an effort to put the techniques into practice.\\" Training costs between 70 and 250 a session, but it's usually covered by insurance. And when Penzien and his colleagues studied the cost of behavioral therapies a few years ago, they found that most people learn the techniques in just a few sessions. 13 Surprising Ways to Fight Headache Pain 18 Signs You're Having a Migraine Supplements. Consider taking a supplement as a preventive measure if your headaches are disabling—even if you only have one or two a month. Since different options work for different people, you may need to try several before finding the one that's most effective for you: Butterbur (or Petasites root) is an herb that can help reduce the frequency of attacks, possibly by reducing inflammation. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that people who took 75 milligrams twice a day had about half as many migraines as usual over a four-month period. Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, reduced headache frequency from four per month to two in a German trial—possibly because it speeds up brain metabolism, which seems to be beneficial for those with migraines. \\"The effective dose is 400 milligrams per day,\\" Goadsby said. Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like substance found in meats and seafood. It, too, may boost the brain's energy metabolism. Research shows a dose of 100 milligrams three times a day can decrease the frequency of headaches by about 50 percent. Magnesium is an element that's involved in a variety of bodily functions, and there's some evidence that low levels can trigger migraines. \\"A dose of 300 to 500 milligrams a day might help,\\" Charles said. Medication. \\"If you have several disabling attacks a month, and you can't control the pain, talk to your doctor about using preventive medication on a daily basis,\\" Goadsby said. Options include: Beta-blockers normally used to treat high blood pressure, such as propranolol (sold as Inderal) and timolol (sold as Blocadren), help prevent headaches likely because they help improve blood flow. Antiseizure drugs topiramate (sold as Topamax) and valproic acid (sold as Depakote) may reduce your migraines because epilepsy and migraines are caused by similar reactions in the brain. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are used for migraine prevention because they regulate levels of the feel-good chemical serotonin in the brain, and it's believed that serotonin may play a role in the development of migraines. Botox injections are approved for use in people with chronic migraines (headaches more than 15 days a month). They help people have fewer headaches and less painful headaches, possibly because Botox affects the facial nerves that play a role in migraines, according to Goadsby. As it starts: Nip it in the bud Sometimes, catching an attack in the pre-head-pain phase, known as prodrome, can prevent a full-blown headache. Not everyone has early-warning symptoms, but a 2004 study at the Headache Center of Atlanta found that about a third of people experienced signs like feeling tired and moody or having diarrhea and neck pain about eight hours before their migraine set in. Lifestyle changes. Because stress is the most common migraine trigger, you might be able to stave off a headache by taking a few minutes to decompress, Penzien said. Try five minutes of diaphragmatic breathing: Lie on your back with a pillow beneath your head and another under your knees, so your legs are slightly bent. (You can also do this sitting in a chair.) Put your right hand on your upper chest and your left just below your rib cage. Breathe in slowly through your nose so your stomach pushes up against your left hand. Then, as you exhale, blowing out through pursed lips, tighten your stomach muscles and let them fall inward. Your right hand should remain as still as possible through the inhale and exhale. Medication. A pair of recent studies looked at treating migraine during the pre-headache stage and found it was at least moderately effective in heading off an attack, so it makes sense to talk to your doctor about taking a triptan, such as Imitrex. These drugs (if appropriate for you, your doc will give you an Rx and determine the best dose) reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels in the brain. You can also try an over-the-counter pain med such as ibuprofen (400 to 600 milligrams). During the migraine: Treat it Though it's better to prevent a headache than try to get rid of it, that's not always possible. Fortunately, there are good options for managing the pain when you're hit by a migraine. Medication. \\"All medications work better when you take them early in the attack—within 30 minutes of when you feel the headache coming on, whether you're actually feeling pain yet or not,\\" Tepper said. \\"Also, you have to be careful not to use any medications more than 10 days a month, because you run the risk of transforming your periodic headaches into a chronic condition.\\" OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen and ibuprofen inhibit blood vessel inflammation, so they can reduce the pain, as can simple analgesics like aspirin or acetaminophen. Another good option: drugs (like Excedrin) that combine acetaminophen and aspirin with caffeine, which narrows blood vessels and increases the effectiveness of pain relievers. Triptans are the best prescription option for treating migraines, but because they constrict blood vessels, you can't use them if you have a history of heart attack or stroke. Dihydroergotamine (sold as Migranal) is a new Rx nasal spray or injection that tightens blood vessels in the brain. Studies show it reduces nausea and sensitivity to light and sound as well as pain. Lifestyle changes. Rest. If you can do it, relax in a dark, quiet room at the first sign of a headache—either during the aura phase or the second the pain hits. Stretch your neck by tilting your head gently to one side for 10 seconds, then the other. \\"Neck tightness and discomfort are common symptoms, so stretching might provide a little relief,\\" said Charles. Relax. Try yoga or progressive muscle relaxation (in which you tighten, then relax one group of muscles at a time, starting at your calves and working up to shoulders). Because of the connection between migraine and stress, relaxing can make a big difference.

The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America.  She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider.  Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War.  He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey.  Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers.

What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us.

Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from?

Creativity seems to be a combination of various elements for most people. It often involves a unique idea or vision, which could spontaneously occur or be the result of some subconscious process. This idea is then combined with the necessary skills and hard work to bring it to fruition.  The philosophical aspect of creativity lies in its inherently subjective nature, as it varies from person to person and depends on one's unique perspective, experiences, and influences. Some view creativity primarily as a natural gift, while others may view it more as a learned skill that can be nurtured through practice and open-mindedness.  Furthermore, creativity, as a broad concept, transcends various disciplines—from arts and literature to science and technology. It lies in the heart of human endeavors and problem-solving, allowing individuals to come up with solutions that are inventive, innovative, and unique. In this sense, creativity contributes significantly to human progress and growth. Creativity can be seen as a unique combination of individual traits, cognitive processes, and contextual factors. Neuroscience and psychology have attempted to explain the sources of creativity, and their research suggests that it arises from an intricate web of connections throughout the brain. These connections may involve the engagement of various cognitive processes such as memory, perception, and associative thinking, which work together in synergy. The question of whether everyone's creativity is different could be approached from the perspective that, indeed, every individual has a unique combination of traits, experiences, and perspectives that shape their creative potential. It is essential to recognize that creativity is not a fixed, monolithic concept, and it can manifest in various forms and degrees throughout various domains. To sum up, creativity is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that hinges on a person's individual perspective, cognitive processes, and contextual factors. Our understanding of creativity can be enriched by investigating it from philosophical, psychological, and neurological perspectives, allowing for a more profound appreciation of its essential role in human life and progress."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"A second biotechnology district is being planned for the median strip on Frontage Road, on land cleared for the never-built Route 34 extension.

He was the founder of the Soviet Union and the first leader of the newly formed state, serving as the head of government from 1917 until his death in 1924. Lenin was important for several reasons: 1. Leading the Bolshevik Revolution: Lenin led the Bolshevik Party in the October Revolution of 1917, overthrowing the Provisional Government and establishing socialist rule in Russia. This event marked the beginning of the Russian Civil War and eventually led to the formation of the Soviet Union. 2. Founding the Soviet Union: As the leader of the Bolshevik Party, Lenin played a crucial role in the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922, which united various nationalities under a communist government. 3. Developing Marxism-Leninism theory: Lenin's interpretation of Marxism, known as Marxism-Leninism, became the dominant political ideology in the Soviet Union. It combined Marx's ideas of dialectical materialism and class struggle with Lenin's theories about the role of the vanguard party, imperialism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. 4. Implementing socialist policies: As the leader of the Soviet government, Lenin implemented significant socialist policies, including wealth redistribution, nationalization of industries, and the establishment of collective farms, which changed the economic structure and social organization of Russia. 5. Impact on global politics: Lenin's success inspired other socialist and communist movements worldwide. The existence of the Soviet Union as a global power until its collapse in 1991, played a significant role in shaping international politics during the 20th century, particularly during the Cold War, when it was in direct competition with the United States and its capitalist allies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Vitamins are stored in foods we eat. The kids are udner great need of vitamins for growth. As they use their energy in playing, they need lots of vitamins. Children usually choose certain foods above the others and often do not eat those with important nutrients . Sothough the food they are eating is nutritious, it may not always provide all the nutrients the child needs. One nutrient can not balance the shortage  of another. Foods like grains, vegetables, fruits and meats should be eaten daily, because different foods in the child's diet can balance against taking too much or too little of any nutrient. Kids grow slower in their childhood than when they were babies or when they develop into adults. Energy output is high, with hard paly perids that include plenty of running, jumping, and testing of new physical skills. So they need a lot of vitamins. Here are some important vitamins and their functions Vitamin D in milk helps your bones. Vitamin A in carrots helps you see at night. Vitamin C in oranges helps your body heal if you get a cut. B vitamins in leafy vegetables helps your body make protein . The children, who are suffering from a sickness called cystic fibrosis, lose vitamin A, D and E. These are main body-building vitamins. Therefore, vitamin supplements  may be necessary. Blood tests will telll you whether a child needs vitamin supplements. If babies over nine months of age are receiving whole cow's milk, they'll need a daily vitamin C supplement till their diet provide enough vitamin C. Vitamin D is added to all milks so babies drinking them need no extra vitamin D. Children are greatly in need of vitamin C.

They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. \\"Tetraploid\\" means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus, referred to as the A and D genomes. The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the D-genome relative of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a wild Central American cotton species) because of its small size and limited number of repetitive elements. It is nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once.[clarification needed] The A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of G. raimondii's. Part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE). Once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties. This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively. Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.

They chose two kinds: one is called G. raimondii and the other is G. arboreum. They will first study G. raimondii because it has a smaller genome, and then they'll move on to G. arboreum, which has a bigger genome. Now, the tricky part comes when they study the more complicated cotton plants, called tetraploid cotton. To understand these plants better, they need something to compare them with.

Pope Francis has confessed that he fell in love with a girl that he met when he was training to be a priest. After a week-long fixation, the Latin pontiff then aged 22 or 23 had to seek redemption in the confession booth, he revealed. In an extraordinary interview to celebrate his first year in the Catholic church’s top job, Francis revealed that ‘there was a girl that turned my head for a week when I was at the seminary.’ Holy secret: Pope Francis, pictured in the Vatican today, has revealed that he had to seek redemption in the confession booth, after falling in love with a woman when he was at the seminary in his early 20s. He said: ‘But we were young.’ He added mischievously: ‘I tell my confessor about these things.’ The Argentinian pontiff seems to have had no problem attracting the ladies in his youth. Pope Francis has said he is finding the growing ‘Superpope’ hype that surrounds him offensive. In an interview published to mark his first anniversary as pontiff, he said that he dislikes the media painting a picture of him as a celebrity and a star. However, in stark contrast, the Vatican is marking the anniversary of his election with commemorative stamps and coins and a DVD with never-before-seen footage of the pope. Francis told Italian daily Corriere della: ‘Depicting the pope as a sort of Superman, a star, is offensive to me. ‘The pope is a man who laughs, cries, sleeps calmly and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.’ He has previously revealed that he had a girlfriend when he was 17, that he used to go dancing with in salsa clubs. However his vocation to the priesthood was too strong. On a night out with friends in Buenos Aires, the youngster stopped to go to confession when his decision to join the priesthood came upon him. And after he became pope, a long lost childhood love came forward. Former neighbour Amalia Damonte told how their families had divided them after the then Jorge Maria Bergoglio had sworn to marry her, aged 12. In the anniversary interview, Francis also revealed that former Pope Benedict XVI was to come out of retirement. Loved: Pope Francis waves at the crowd upon his arrival at St.Peter's square for the weekly general audience on Wednesday. The papa: Pope Francis joked with the crowd and even put on a military Alpine hat as the interview about his week-long love story was published. Big wave: The interview, done in the anniversary of his ascent to Pope, also saw him reveal that his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI will come out of retirement. After becoming the first Pope in 600. years to resign a year ago, Benedict was forced to commit to a. cloistered life, remaining ‘hidden from the world’. In the interview, Pope Francis defended the Catholic Church’s record on child abuse saying that it had done much since the scandal first broke some 15 years ago and was being singled out for attack. He defended the Church and his predecessor former Pope Benedict, whom Francis credited with having the courage to start reforms. ‘On this path, the Church has done much, perhaps more than all others,’ he said. ‘The Catholic Church is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility. 'No-one has done more, and yet the Church is the only one that is being attacked,’ he said. He appeared to be referring to a report by a United Nations committee last month which accused the Vatican of systematically turning a blind eye to decades of sexual abuse of children by priests, and demanded it turn over known or suspected offenders to civil justice. A ‘shadow Pope’ lurking would become a rallying point for opposition to Francis and risk splitting the Catholic Church, many in the Curia or Vatican civil service feared. But Francis said that his predecessor still had a lot to offer, and was like ‘a granddad who didn’t deserve to be put in an old people’s home.’ ‘We discussed it and decided together that it’s best that he sees people and goes out and rejoins church life’, he told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. ‘Some wanted him to retire to a Benedictine monastery far from the Vatican. 'But it made me think of granddads who strengthen the family with their knowledge and advice and don’t deserve to be put in an old people’s home.’ Francis appeared to pave the way for his own eventual retirement saying that although Benedict was the first, Pope Emeritus, or retired Pope, the position would become routine. ‘It should be an institution, he said. ‘He [Benedict] is the first and perhaps there will be others’, he hinted.

I know that the answer to the question \\"How does the bacteria get acquired resistance?\\" is in \\"Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Acquired resistance in bacteria occurs as a result of mutations in the bacterial chromosome or through the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Whenever someone begins to talk to me about how horrible it is to eat meat and suggests that a nice piece of tofu would be just as good, I just smile and show them those nice pointy teeth we all have in the corners of our mouths. They are called canines  , and they are there only for the purpose of eating meat. When it comes to satisfying this kind of desire, soy   food can never match a well-prepared tri-tip (also know as triangle beef steak ). Just the thought of the beef, burning on the grill   with the smell of wood smoke gets the mouth watering and brings back memories of summer barbecues. When the knife cuts through the tri- tip, exposing the red meat bursting with juices, it's more than just cooking. It's a cultural event, showing we are at the top of the food chain, like no other food can. Nutritionally speaking, the tri-tip is one of the better cuts of beef. It is lower in fat than many other cuts, and the proteins   you get from eating meat are more complete than those that come from vegetables, making meat a better choice for building and keeping up your muscle tissue healthy. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, one thing to be aware of with soy products in general is that while they are high in iron, a necessary mineral for the body, they also contain something that blocks the body's absorption of iron. We can cook them in various ways to make them tasty. Anyway, the tri-tip goes a lot better with ice-cold beer than a large piece of bean-curd cheese would, no matter how you cook it. I guess I should say at least e good thing about tofu. If you cook it just right, you can make it taste a little like the tri-tip, but only a little. Question: Compared with tofu, the tri-tip is   _  . Options: A: more nutritious but poorer in proteins B: higher in iron and other useful minerals C: more beneficial for muscle development D: harder for eaters to take in its iron The answer is:","output":"C: more beneficial for muscle development.  Step 1: Read the article and understand the key points. Step 2: Identify the comparison points between tofu and tri-tip in the article. Step 3: Evaluate the information given about tri-tip and tofu as related to each option. Justification:  Option A is incorrect because the article states that proteins from meat are more complete than those from vegetables, which implies that tri-tip has better proteins rather than poorer proteins as compared to tofu. Option B is incorrect because the article only mentions that soy products (tofu) are high in iron, but does not mention that tri-tip is higher in iron or other minerals. Option C is correct because the article states that meat proteins are more complete as compared to those from vegetables, meaning tri-tip will be more beneficial for muscle development than tofu. Option D is incorrect because the article says that soy products - like tofu - have substances that block the body's absorption of iron, but doesn't attribute that issue to tri-tip."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey. More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the 2014 mayoral election where the centre-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the 2017 constitutional referendum, where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country.... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who won the vote with 48.77% in 2019?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The article does not provide the first name of the person who won the vote with 48.77% in 2019."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Plumerias require temperatures of at least 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 18 to 27 degrees Celsius). They will not survive in temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius). Any parts of the plant exposed to freezing temperatures will die. Therefore, it is important to choose the right location. If your climate regularly or seasonally gets colder than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius), do not plant your plumeria in the ground outside. Instead, plant it in a container that you can keep inside when it gets cold.  Even though plumerias have strict temperature requirements, they are flexible in that they can flourish outside or inside. Plumerias can survive in very hot temperatures, even over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius). Plumerias grow best in full sunlight, which is at least 6 hours a day. Find a location where the tree will be exposed to regular sunlight. Plumerias grow well in greenhouses or near a big window with lots of light if you are growing it inside. If planting your plumeria outside, you can plant it in a pot or in the ground. If planting plumerias in the ground, they will need to be planted 10 to 20 feet apart so that their roots have adequate space to grow. You can plant a root ball in a hole that is the same depth as the roots, but 2 to 3 times the width. Choose a planting location where the soil drains well and water doesn't puddle after a rainfall. Avoid locations where the plumeria will be exposed to heat radiating off a brick or concrete wall. Planting your plumeria in a container is useful so that you can move it inside if it gets cold. Or you can simply grow your plumeria inside year-round. If planting your plumeria in a container, be sure to use one with a hole or several holes in the bottom to provide soil and water drainage, as a plumeria won't do well with wet feet. Use at least a one gallon size container so that it has adequate room to grow. Black nursery containers are preferable to clay pots because of the porous nature of clay, which allows roots to be embedded in the walls and moisture to escape too quickly.  You can find black nursery containers at your local gardening store. Plastic pots are another good option because they lack the porousness of clay. Since one of the biggest hazards to plumerias is overwatering, make sure your soil is fast draining, like cactus mix. If it is too dense or fine, it will hold too much water. Coarse soil will help ensure adequate drainage. Choose one with a slightly acidic pH as well, from around 6 to 6.7. To make sure your soil will drain properly, you can mix it with some perlite or sand. Soil can be found at your local gardening store. If you are planting your plumeria outside, make sure the soil drains well by mixing it with an organic material like manure or peat. If you don’t want to plant your own plumeria, you can buy one already grown. Purchase a healthy plumeria tree at a local nursery. Select a compact plumeria plant with even, bright color and a sturdy, straight trunk. Look for evenly spaced branches. Avoid plants with wilted leaves or poor color. Summary:","output":"Plumerias are plants that need a warm temperature, between 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 27 degrees Celsius). They cannot live in very cold weather. If it's too cold, you should plant your plumeria in a big pot and keep it inside. Plumerias like lots of sunlight and warm places. Make sure they are not too close to each other when you plant them, and choose a spot where water doesn't stay after it rains. When planting in a pot, pick one with holes for water to come out, and use special soil that drains well. It's important not to give plumerias too much water. If you don't want to plant your own, you can buy a healthy plumeria from a garden store."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

In this sentence, all the spaces between words have been removed as requested. The original sentence described the elegant and delicate flavor profile of the white Chardonnay grape, which is known for its notes of white flowers such as white cast iron and acacia, as well as white fruits like apple, pear, and various citrus fruits. The popularity of Chardonnay as a grape variety can be attributed to its versatility and ability to produce a wide range of wine styles, from crisp, mineral-driven wines with high acidity to rich, full-bodied wines with buttery, oaky flavors. Chardonnay grapes thrive in a wide range of climates and soil types, making it one of the most widely planted grape varieties worldwide. The grape variety is commonly used to produce a diverse array of white wines, including still, sparkling, and dessert wines, and is a primary grape in the production of Champagne. The wine's characteristics can vary depending on the region it is grown in and the winemaking techniques used, allowing Chardonnay to express itself in a multitude of styles. In cooler climates, such as Chablis in France, Chardonnay tends to produce wines with high acidity and more mineral-driven flavors. These wines often have a distinct flintiness and are typically aged in stainless steel or neutral oak barrels, preserving the freshness and purity of the grape's fruit flavors. Green apple, pear, and citrus notes are common in these types of Chardonnay wines. In warmer climates, such as California and Australia, Chardonnay grapes can develop riper fruit flavors, giving the resulting wines a more lush, tropical fruit profile. Melon, pineapple, and ripe peach notes are often found in Chardonnays from these regions. Winemakers may also choose to age these wines in new oak barrels, imparting further flavors such as vanilla, toast, and butter, resulting in a rich, full-bodied wine. The versatility of Chardonnay has also made it a popular choice for blending with other grape varieties. The most famous example of blended Chardonnay is its role as one of the main components in Champagne and other sparkling wines from around the world, where it is often blended with Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Chardonnay lends these wines its signature acidity and structure, while the other grape varieties contribute their unique flavors and textures. In conclusion, Chardonnay is a diverse and adaptable grape variety that can produce a wide range of wine styles, from elegant and mineral-driven wines with high acidity to rich and buttery wines with ripe fruit flavors. Its ability to thrive in different climates and its desirable taste profile have made it one of the most widely planted grape varieties in the world, and its elegant notes of white flowers, white fruits, and citrus fruits have made it a favorite among wine enthusiasts for generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who moved to Sedbergh School in 1827, where he remained for two years?  Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\".... Answer:","output":"Edmund"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An example of navigation is directing a boat Which of the following would have best aided a vessel at sea in crossing the sea in the 18th century?","output":"In the 18th century, some of the best aids for navigating a vessel at sea were: 1. Sextant: A sextant is a navigational instrument used to measure the angle between an astronomical object and the horizon. This information would then be used to determine the vessel's latitude. Using a sextant, navigators could accurately determine their position at sea. 2. Compass: A magnetic compass is an essential tool for determining the vessel's heading and direction. By knowing the ship's direction, sailors could maintain a steady course and avoid deviating from their intended path. 3. Celestial navigation: This technique involves using the positions of the stars, sun, and moon to determine the vessel's latitude and longitude. By observing these celestial bodies and their positions, navigators could determine their position on the Earth. 4. Nautical charts: Accurate and up-to-date charts provided mariners with information on safe routes, ocean currents, prominent coastal features, and locations of hazards such as shoals or reefs. Having a good set of charts allowed sailors to plan their voyages more effectively. 5. Log and line: A log and line was a simple device for measuring a ship's speed through the water. The \\"log\\" was a wooden or metal object that was thrown into the water, attached to a long line with evenly spaced knots. As the ship moved through the water, a sailor would count the number of knots that passed through their fingers over a certain period (usually measured with an hourglass). This measurement allowed the crew to track their progress and estimate the remaining time to reach their destination. Of these options, the best aids for crossing the sea in the 18th century would be a combination of the sextant, compass, celestial navigation, nautical charts, and the log and line. By using these tools and techniques, sailors could effectively navigate their vessels across the open ocean."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.  Which pack was preying more upon herds?  Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. The answer to this question is:","output":"The Mobutu pack was preying more upon herds.  Here's a step-by-step analysis of each pack's hunting behavior and why the Mobutu pack is more focused on herds: 1. The Simba pack primarily targets wounded individual prey animals. While these animals might be part of a herd, the Simba pack's hunting tactic revolves around identifying and ambushing vulnerable individual targets rather than focusing on the entire group. 2. The Mobutu pack, on the other hand, follows large groups of zebras and other grazers. This means that their hunting strategy relies on staying close to or following entire herds, which implies a focus on herds while hunting. 3. The hint given refers to how predators may have difficulty attacking individual animals in large groups, such as zebras. This suggests that the Mobutu pack, which follows herds of zebras and grazers, is more likely to face the challenges of a predator confusing in the context of large herds. 4. Martin Stevens and his colleagues' research on the zebra's diverse striped patterns causing confusion among predators supports the idea that targeting herds is more challenging for predators. This further reinforces that the Mobutu pack, which focuses on large groups, is preying more upon herds. In conclusion, based on the hunting strategies of both packs and the hint provided, the Mobutu pack is preying more upon herds as they follow large groups of zebras and other grazers, thus facing the challenges associated with hunting within large group settings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It follows the tragic death of a 21-year-old woman who suffered a fatal blood clot after she was prescribed the contraceptive pill.      Fallan Kurek, who worked as a teaching assistant with children with learning disabilities, was prescribed Rigevidon by her GP to regulate her periods.      Thousands of women across Northern Ireland take the pill daily to regulate periods, reduce painful periods and to protect from pregnancy.      The pill can also be used to treat acne.      Derry GP, Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association, said: “I think it is fair to say that the pill has been used for decades and the formulations we are using now in terms of hormones are a lower dose than would have been many years ago.      “Obviously, you need to be careful and take professional advice, particularly those patients who are overweight, older or those who smoke.      “There are those people who can’t use the pill but overall there have been millions of prescriptions for the pill and most people can use it safely.”      Ms Kurek had been taking the pill for just 25 days when she collapsed at her home in Staffordshire in England.      BPM Fallan Kurek's parents, Brian and Julia Kurek      Paramedics rushed to her house after she began vomiting – but minutes later she stopped breathing and turned blue.      She was rushed to hospital but died three days later on May 14.      A postmortem found she died as a result of a pulmonary embolism – a blockage in the lung normally caused by a blood clot.      According to the NHS, there is a very low risk of serious side effects from taking the contraceptive pill, such as blood clots and cervical cancer.      Rigevidon is a combined oral contraceptive pill used to prevent pregnancy.      Each tablet contains two types of female sex hormones – oestrogen and a progesterone in low doses.      Contraceptive pills that contain two hormones are called combined oral contraceptive pills.      The combined pill is not suitable for women over 35 who smoke, or women with certain medical conditions, such as those who have suffered migraines. ||||| The combined oral contraceptive pill is usually just called \\"the pill\\". It contains artificial versions of female hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which women produce naturally in their ovaries.      A woman can get pregnant if a man's sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening usually by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping the release of an egg (ovulation).      Facts at a glance: the combined pill      How it works      What to do if you miss a pill      Who can use the combined pill      Advantages and disadvantages      Risks      At a glance : the combined pill      When taken correctly, the pill is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. Other methods, such as the IUD, implant and injection, are more effective.      at preventing pregnancy. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. Other methods, such as the IUD, implant and injection, are more effective. The usual way to take the pill is to take one every day for 21 days, then stop for seven days, and during this week you have a period-type bleed. You start taking the pill again after seven days.      You need to take the pill at around the same time every day. You could get pregnant if you don't do this, or if you miss a pill, or vomit or have severe diarrhoea.      Some medicines may make the pill less effective. Check with your doctor if you're taking any other tablets.      If you have heavy periods or painful periods, PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or endometriosis the combined pill may help.      Minor side effects include mood swings, nausea, breast tenderness and headaches.      There is no evidence that the pill makes women gain weight.      There's a very low risk of serious side effects, such as blood clots and cervical cancer.      The combined pill is not suitable for women over 35 who smoke, or women with certain medical conditions.      The pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so using a condom as well will help to protect you against STIs.      How the combined pill works      How it prevents pregnancy      Monophasic 21-day pills      Phasic 21-day pills      Every day (ED) pills      How to take 21-day pills      How to take every day pills      Starting the combined pill      Taking pill packs back-to-back      How it prevents pregnancy      The pill prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg each month (ovulation). It also:      thickens the mucus in the neck of the womb, so it is harder for sperm to penetrate the womb and reach an egg      thins the lining of the womb, so there is less chance of a fertilised egg implanting into the womb and being able to grow      The pill is over 99% effective if used correctly. Some women find it difficult to take the pill at the same time every day, and it's less effective if not used correctly. Other methods of contraception are better at preventing pregnancy, such as the IUD, IUS, implant and injection.      There are many different brands of pill, made up of three main types:      Monophasic 21-day pills      This is the most common type. Each pill has the same amount of hormone in it. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Microgynon, Marvelon, Yasmine and Cilest are examples of this type of pill.      Phasic 21-day pills      Phasic pills contain two or three sections of different coloured pills in a pack. Each section contains a different amount of hormones. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Phasic pills need to be taken in the right order. Logynon is an example of this type of pill.      Every d ay (ED) pills      There are 21 active pills and seven inactive (dummy) pills in a pack. The two types of pill look different. One pill is taken each day for 28 days with no break between packets of pills. Every day pills need to be taken in the right order. Microgynon ED is an example of this type of pill.      Follow the instructions that come with your packet. If you have any questions, ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist.      It's important to take the pills as instructed, because missing pills or taking them at the same time as certain medicines may make them less effective.      How to take 21-day pills      Take your first pill from the packet marked with the correct day of the week, or the first pill of the first colour (phasic pills).      Continue to take a pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished.      Stop taking pills for seven days (during these seven days you will get a bleed).      Start your next pack of pills on the eighth day, whether you are still bleeding or not. This should be the same day of the week as when you took your first pill.      How to take every day pills      Take the first pill from the section of the packet marked \\"start\\". This will be an active pill.      Continue to take a pill every day, in the correct order and preferably at the same time each day, until the pack is finished (28 days).      During the seven days of taking the inactive pills, you will get a bleed.      Start your next pack of pills after you have finished the first, whether you are still bleeding or not.      Starting the combined pill      Most women can start the pill at any time in their menstrual cycle. There is special guidance if you have just had a baby, abortion or miscarriage.      You may need to use additional contraception during your first days on the pill – this depends on when in your menstrual cycle you start taking it.      Starting on the first day of your period      If you start the combined pill on the first day of your period (day one of your menstrual cycle) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. You will not need additional contraception.      Starting on the fifth day of your cycle or before      If you start the pill on the fifth day of your period or before, you will still be protected from pregnancy straight away, unless you have a short menstrual cycle (your period is every 23 days or less). If you have a short menstrual cycle, you will need additional contraception, such as condoms, until you have taken the pill for seven days.      Starting after the fifth day of your cycle      You will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days.      If you start the pill after the fifth day of your cycle, make sure you have not put yourself at risk of pregnancy since your last period. If you're worried you're pregnant when you start the pill, take a pregnancy test three weeks after the last time you had unprotected sex.      What to do if you miss a pill      If you miss a pill or pills, or you start a pack late, this can make the pill less effective at preventing pregnancy. The chance of getting pregnant after missing a pill or pills depends on:      when the pills are missed      how many pills are missed      Find out what to do if you miss a combined pill.      Vomiting and diarrhoea      If you vomit within two hours of taking the combined pill, it may not have been fully absorbed into your bloodstream. Take another pill straight away and the next pill at your usual time.      If you continue to be sick, keep using another form of contraception until you've taken the pill again for seven days without vomiting.      Very severe diarrhoea (six to eight watery stools in 24 hours) may also mean that the pill doesn't work properly. Keep taking your pill as normal, but use additional contraception, such as condoms, while you have diarrhoea and for two days after recovering.      Speak to your GP or contraception nurse or call NHS 111 for more information, or if your sickness or diarrhoea continues.      Who can use the combined pill      If there are no medical reasons why you cannot take the pill, and you don't smoke, you can take the pill until your menopause. However, the pill is not suitable for all women. To find out whether the pill is right for you, talk to your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist.      You should not take the pill if you:      are pregnant      smoke and are 35 or older      stopped smoking less than a year ago and are 35 or older      are very overweight      take certain medicines (ask your GP or a health professional at a contraception clinic about this)      You should also not take the pill if you have (or have had):      thrombosis (a blood clot) in a vein, for example in your leg or lungs      stroke or any other disease that narrows the arteries      anyone in your close family having a blood clot under the age of 45      a heart abnormality or heart disease, including high blood pressure      severe migraines, especially with aura (warning symptoms)      breast cancer      disease of the gallbladder or liver      diabetes with complications or diabetes for the past 20 years      After having a baby      If you have just had a baby and are not breastfeeding, you can most likely start the pill on day 21 after the birth but you will need to check with your doctor. You will be protected against pregnancy straight away.      If you start the pill later than 21 days after giving birth, you will need additional contraception (such as condoms) for the next seven days.      If you are breastfeeding, you're not advised to take the combined pill until six weeks after the birth.      After a miscarriage or abortion      If you have had a miscarriage or abortion, you can start the pill up to five days after this and you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill more than five days after the miscarriage or abortion, you'll need to use additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days.      Advantages and disadvantages      Some advantages of the pill include:      it does not interrupt sex      it usually makes your bleeds regular, lighter and less painful      it reduces your risk of cancer of the ovaries, womb and colon      it can reduce symptoms of PMS (premenstrual syndrome)      it can sometimes reduce acne      it may protect against pelvic inflammatory disease      it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease      Some disadvantages of the pill include:      it can cause temporary side effects at first, such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood swings – if these do not go after a few months, it may help to change to a different pill      it can increase your blood pressure      it does not protect you against sexually transmitted infections      breakthrough bleeding and spotting is common in the first few months of using the pill      it has been linked to an increased risk of some serious health conditions, such as thrombosis (blood clots) and breast cancer      The combined pill with other medicines      Some medicines interact with the combined pill and it doesn't work properly. Some interactions are listed on this page, but it is not a complete list. If you want to check your medicines are safe to take with the combined pill, you can:      ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist      read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine      Antibiotics      The antibiotics rifampicin and rifabutin (which can be used to treat illnesses including tuberculosis and meningitis) can reduce the effectiveness of the combined pill. Other antibiotics do not have this effect.      If you are prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need additional contraception (such as condoms) while taking the antibiotic. Speak to your doctor or nurse for advice.      Epilepsy and HIV medicines, and St John's wort      The combined pill can interact with medicines called enzyme inducers. These speed up the breakdown of hormones by your liver, reducing the effectiveness of the pill.      Examples of enzyme inducers are:      the epilepsy drugs carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and topiramate      St John's wort (a herbal remedy)      antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV (research suggests that interactions between these medicines and the progestogen-only pill can affect the safety and effectiveness of both)      Your GP or nurse may advise you to use an alternative or additional form of contraception while taking any of these medicines.      Risks of taking the combined pill      There are some risks associated with using the combined contraceptive pill. However, these risks are small and, for most women, the benefits of the pill outweigh the risks.      Blood clots      The oestrogen in the pill may cause your blood to clot more readily. If a blood clot develops, it could cause:      deep vein thrombosis (clot in your leg)      pulmonary embolus (clot in your lung)      stroke      heart attack      The risk of getting a blood clot is very small, but your doctor will check if you have certain risk factors that before prescribing the pill.      The pill can be taken with caution if you have one of the risk factors below. It is unlikely you would be advised to take it if you have two or more risk factors. These include:      being 35 years old or over      being a smoker or having quit smoking in the past year      being very overweight (in women with a BMI of 35 or over, the risks of using the pill usually outweigh the benefits)      having migraines (you should not take the pill if you have severe or regular migraine attacks, especially if you get aura or a warning sign before an attack)      having high blood pressure      having had a blood clot or stroke in the past      having a close relative who had a blood clot when they were younger than 45      being immobile for a long time – for example, in a wheelchair or with a leg in plaster      Cancer      Research is ongoing into the link between breast cancer and the pill. Research suggests that users of all types of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with women who do not use them. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal.      Research has also suggested a link between the pill and the risk of developing cervical cancer and a rare form of liver cancer. However, the pill does offer some protection against developing womb (endometrial) cancer, ovarian cancer and colon cancer.      Where you can get the combined pill      Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include:      community contraception clinics      some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics      sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services      some GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse      some young people's services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information)      Find your nearest sexual health clinic.      If you're under 16 years old      Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16.      If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions.      Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you.      The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first. ||||| Following our story of the tragic death of 21-year-old Fallan Kurek, who after taking the contraceptive pill, we have pulled together the latest information on the risks of taking the combined pill or progestogen-only pill below.

These include:      being 35 years old or over      being a smoker or having quit smoking in the past year      being very overweight (in women with a BMI of 35 or over, the risks of using the pill usually outweigh the benefits)      having migraines (you should not take the pill if you have severe or regular migraine attacks, especially if you get aura or a warning sign before an attack)      having high blood pressure      having had a blood clot or stroke in the past      having a close relative who had a blood clot when they were younger than 45      being immobile for a long time – for example, in a wheelchair or with a leg in plaster      Advantages and disadvantages      Some advantages of the pill include:      it does not interrupt sex      it usually makes your bleeds regular, lighter and less painful      it reduces your risk of cancer of the ovaries, womb and colon      it can reduce symptoms of PMS      it can sometimes reduce acne      it may protect against pelvic inflammatory disease      it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease      Some disadvantages of the pill include:      it can cause temporary side effects at first, such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood swings – if these do not go after a few months, it may help to change to a different pill      it can increase your blood pressure      it does not protect you against sexually transmitted infections      breakthrough bleeding and spotting is common in the first few months of using the pill      it has been linked to an increased risk of some serious health conditions, such as thrombosis (blood clots) and breast cancer      Risks of taking the progestogen-only pill      The progestogen-only pill is very safe to take. However, as with the combined contraceptive pill, there are certain risks. These risks are small. For most women, benefits of the progestogen-only pill outweigh the risks.      Ovarian cysts      Some women can develop fluid-filled cysts on their ovaries. These are not dangerous and do not usually need to be removed. These cysts usually disappear without treatment. In many cases, the cysts do not cause symptoms, although some women experience pelvic pain.      Breast cancer      Research is continuing into the link between breast cancer and the progestogen-only pill. Research suggests that women who use any type of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with people who don’t use hormonal contraception. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal.      If you have a family history of breast cancer, you may feel that this increase in risk (however small it is) is not worth taking. However, doctors do not think that using the contraceptive pill is likely to increase the risk in women who already have close relatives with breast cancer.      Advantages and disadvantages      Some advantages of the progestogen-only pill include:      it does not interrupt sex      you can use it when breastfeeding      it is useful if you cannot take the hormone oestrogen, which is in the combined pill, contraceptive patch and vaginal ring      you can use it at any age – even if you smoke and are over 35      it can reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and painful periods      Some disadvantages of the progestogen-only pill include:      you may not have regular periods while taking it – your periods may be lighter, more frequent or may stop altogether, and you may get spotting between periods      it does not protect you against STIs      you need to remember to take it at or around the same time every day      some medications, including certain types of antibiotic, can make it less effective      The progestogen-only pill is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. Some side effects can include:      acne      breast tenderness and breast enlargement      an increased or decreased sex drive      mood changes      headache and migraine      nausea or vomiting      cysts (small fluid-filled sacs) on your ovaries (these are usually harmless and disappear without treatment)      stomach upset      weight gain      Have you experienced health problems using the contraceptive pill?

Paramedics rushed to her house in Tamworth after the 21-year-old teaching assistant vomited and minutes later she turned blue after she stopped breathing.      Fallan was taken to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield with parents Brian and Julia by her side, but after three days in intensive care she was pronounced brain dead.      She passed away just hours later on Thursday May 14, surrounded by her loved-ones.      Her cause of death was recorded as pulmonary embolism on her lung – and her devastated parents say doctors said it was caused by the contraceptive pill she had been taking for just 25 days.      “We felt angry when they first mentioned it could be the pill,” said devastated Julia, who is also mum to Michael, 24, Robert, 22 and Jessica 19.      “She was only on it to regulate her periods. I couldn’t believe nobody had said the pill could do this. It should say it on the pack that they can kill and the label.”      Fallan, who worked as a teaching assistant with children with learning disabilities, was prescribed Rigevidon by her GP to regulate her periods.      Julia said her daughter was told to take the combined pill for three months before having a break.      Breathlessness      But after three weeks of taking the contraceptive, she began suffering with breathlessness and pains in her legs and ribs.      While out with her parents at a local salon she suffered what they thought was a panic attack. Worried Brian took her to the local Sir John Peel Hospital for a check-up where she was given an electrocardiogram (ECG).      “They said everything was fine, they said she had probably bruised her sternum,” recalled Julia.      “They said to go home and take some Ibuprofen and paracetemol. If symptoms continue then go see your GP.      “We thought nothing more of it, she still said she had this little niggling pain, but it wasn’t bothering her too much.”      Four days later Julia and Brian went to wake up Fallan to see if she was feeling any better.      “She said she felt fine, but when she sat up in bed she started getting breathless again,” said Brian, 52.      “She took her pill, then she got up, and then began walking downstairs.      “But as she got half way down the stairs she collapsed. I got to the bottom of the stairs and she just went limp in my arms.’’      Paramedics arrived and began carrying out tests on the still conscious Fallan, but within minutes they switched to emergency CPR when she stopped breathing.      She was rushed to Good Hope Hospital’s intensive care unit, where she was put on a ventilator and emergency scans on her head and chest took place.      But Julia said medics then asked her whether her daughter was taking the pill.      “While they were working on her someone came in to talk to me,” said the mum. “They asked me whether there was any heart problems in the family, or if Fallan had taken drugs - definitely not.      “The third question was, ‘Is she on the pill?’ I said, ‘Yes, is that relevant?’ He said, ‘We know what it is’ and off he went.      “Brian and I just looked at each other - we couldn’t believe it.”      A scan revealed that Fallan had a large clot on her lung, causing the right side of her heart to become inflamed. She spent the next three days in ICU at Good Hope, while her parents waited anxiously by her bedside.      Emergency      “On Wednesday night we were told her blood pressure and heart rate had gone sky high, and she needed an emergency CT scan,” said Julia.      “I just had a horrible feeling. We knew that something bad had happened.”      Sadly, the CT scan revealed that Fallan was clinically brain dead after being starved of oxygen before arriving at hospital.      Her ventilator was switched off on Thursday May 14, and she died half an hour later at 5.10pm.      “Fallen was looking forward to the rest of her life,” said heartbroken Brian. “She was confident, cheeky, bubbly, and the mother hen to all her friends.      “We just don’t want any other family to go through this.”      Inquest      An inquest into her death will be conducted by the South Staffordshire coroner in due course.      Her parents have also been given a temporary death certificate, so they can finally give their daughter a funeral on May 29.      The family is asking that anyone wishing to make a tribute to Fallan to donate to the ICU unit at Good Hope Hospital.      Julia hopes sharing Fallan’s story will raise awareness about potentially fatal symptoms of blood clots and taking the pill. “This is all because of 25 days,” she said.      Her parents also hope medical professionals will take more time to explain serious side effects to all women, not just those in high risk groups, such as smokers or overweight women.      “They know the pill can cause blood clots,” said Brian. “We can’t bring her back, all we can do is maybe save another life.”      Regulation      The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the government body which regulates the drug, insists the pill is safe and that women should continue to take it.      A spokesman said: “Women should continue to take their contraceptive pill. These are very safe, highly effective medicines for preventing unintended pregnancy and the benefits associated with their use far outweigh their risks.      “The safety of contraceptive pills was reviewed at European level in 2014 and the review confirmed that the risk of blood clots with all contraceptives is small. The benefits of any combined hormonal contraceptive far outweigh the risk of serious side effects – prescribers and women should be aware of the major risk factors for blood clots and the key signs and symptoms.      “If women have questions, they should discuss them with their GP or contraceptive provider at their next routine appointment but should keep taking their contraceptive until they have done so.”      Gedeon Ritcher, the Hungarian company that manufacturer Rigevidon, did not respond when approached by the Birmingham Mail.

Email jonny.greatrex@trinitymirror.com ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The tragic death of a 21-year-old woman has led doctors to reassure women about the safety of the contraceptive pill. The woman suffered a fatal blood clot after being prescribed the contraceptive pill. Fallan Kurek, who worked as a teaching assistant with children with learning disabilities, was given Rigevidon by her GP to regulate her periods. Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association said that while it is important to take professional advice before taking the pill, it is safe for most people as there have been millions of prescriptions and the formulations have a lower hormone dose than in previous years. According to the NHS, there is a very low risk of serious side effects from taking the contraceptive pill, however, it is important to consult with a doctor before starting any new medication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished.  and a hint : While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.  Please answer this question : Which island had observed the occurrence of natural selection? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and hint provided, Bank island experienced severe drought which led to a diminished food supply.

Not only are they heavily agricultural , but they are some of the most religious areas in Canada .","output":"While these two sentences may seem similar, they are not identical and convey slightly different meanings. To better understand the differences between them, let's break down each sentence and consider its elements: Sentence 1: \\"They are not only hard to religious, but they are some of the most agricultural areas in Canada.\\" In this sentence, \\"hard to religious\\" is an unconventional phrase which seems to be missing a verb or noun. It is unclear what the author intended to convey here. Perhaps the intended meaning was that the areas are difficult to relate to in terms of religion, or that the religious aspect of these areas is hard to define or understand. On the other hand, the second part of this sentence clearly states that these areas are \\"some of the most agricultural areas in Canada.\\" This phrase tells us that the primary characteristic of these areas is their strong association with agriculture. Sentence 2: \\"Not only are they heavily agricultural, but they are some of the most religious areas in Canada.\\" This sentence has more clarity than the first one. Here, the areas are described as \\"heavily agricultural,\\" meaning that agriculture plays a significant role in their economy or landscape. The second part of the sentence, \\"they are some of the most religious areas in Canada,\\" indicates that religion is also a major characteristic of these regions. In comparison, the first sentence seems to suggest that these areas are difficult to understand in terms of religion while being agriculturally significant in Canada. The second sentence emphasizes that these areas are both heavily agricultural and religious. In summary, while both sentences may be referring to the same areas in Canada, they differ in their emphasis and clarity. The first sentence is not entirely clear in its description of the areas' religious aspects, and the second sentence places equal weight on the agricultural and religious characteristics of the areas. Therefore, they do not mean exactly the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Food and water dishes should be cleaned out every day using hot water and dish soap. Rinse the dishes before lathering with soap, then rinse the soap off under hot water for several seconds.","output":"Clean the perches and toys. Birds spend most of their time perching and playing with toys in their cage. To keep the cage clean and safe for your pet, it is essential to clean the perches and toys regularly. Here's how to clean them effectively: 1. Remove all perches, toys, and accessories from the cage, making sure to take note of their original positions so you can put them back in their correct places later. 2. Use a brush or an old toothbrush to scrub off any visible debris or droppings from the perches and toys. This will make the cleaning process much easier and ensure that your bird's belongings are thoroughly cleaned. 3. Prepare a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Make sure that the soap you use is free of any harsh chemicals, as these can be harmful to your bird. The water should be hot enough to dissolve the dirt and grime but not so hot that it's scalding to your touch. 4. Soak the perches, toys, and accessories in the soapy water for about 15 minutes. This will help to loosen any stubborn debris and make scrubbing them easier. 5. After soaking, scrub the items again using a brush or old toothbrush. Be thorough, paying close attention to any nooks, crannies, and hard-to-reach areas. 6. Rinse the perches and toys under hot water, making sure to remove all traces of soap. Any soap residue left behind can cause irritation to your bird's skin and respiratory system. 7. Allow the items to air dry completely before returning them to the cage. Make sure they are free of any moisture, as damp conditions can lead to the growth of mold and bacteria. Clean the cage itself. Once you've cleaned the accessories, it's time to clean the cage itself. Follow these steps to ensure your bird's living environment remains clean, hygienic, and comfortable: 1. Remove your bird safely from the cage and place it in a secure temporary location where it won't be exposed to any potential hazards or stressors. 2. Pre-clean the cage with a brush or vacuum to remove any loose seed hulls, feathers, and other debris. 3. Prepare a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Again, be sure to use a soap that is free of harsh chemicals. 4. Using a sponge or cloth, scrub the surfaces, bars, and corners of the cage, paying particular attention to any stubborn or hard-to-reach areas. Be thorough in your cleaning, as bacteria can build-up in these places and pose a risk to your bird's health. 5. Once you've cleaned the cage entirely, rinse it well with warm water, ensuring that you remove all soap residue. 6. To disinfect the cage, prepare a solution of water and white vinegar or water and hydrogen peroxide, mixed at a 50:50 ratio. Wipe down the cage with this solution, then rinse the cage again with hot water. 7. Let the cage air dry completely before reassembling the perches, toys, and accessories. Ensure the cage is completely dry to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria. 8. Once everything is clean and dry, return your bird to its freshly cleaned cage. Be sure to watch your bird closely for the first few hours after cleaning to ensure it isn't experiencing any discomfort from its clean environment. Maintaining a clean and healthy environment for your bird is essential in ensuring their overall health and well-being. By following this cleaning routine, you'll be providing your bird with a comfortable and safe environment in which it can thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(A) when they're off in the distance (B) when they're up close  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"mountains up close\\" and  \\"mountains off in the distance\\". The answer is:","output":"mountains up close. When Mike initially sees the mountains off in the distance, they appear smaller due to the effect of perspective. Perspective is a phenomenon that affects the way we perceive objects as they recede into the distance. As objects, like mountains, get further away, they appear progressively smaller to the viewer. This is because the angle at which light from the distant object reaches our eyes decreases as the distance between the viewer and the object increases. As Mike continues driving and gets closer to the mountains, the angle at which light from the mountains reaches his eyes increases. As a result, the image of the mountains on his retina becomes larger, and the mountains appear progressively larger to him. This is due to the fact that the distance between Mike and the mountains decreases, resulting in an increased angle of light reaching his eyes. Furthermore, another factor that contributes to the perception of the mountains appearing larger as Mike gets closer is the relative size of the mountains compared to other objects in the environment. When the mountains are off in the distance, they are surrounded by other visual cues, such as trees, buildings, and other landscape features. These cues help our visual system establish a sense of scale, making the mountains seem smaller in comparison. As Mike gets closer to the mountains, these other visual cues become less prominent or disappear altogether, removing any sense of scale. This can cause the mountains to appear even larger than they would if they were viewed in isolation. In conclusion, the mountains will look bigger to Mike when he is up close. This phenomenon occurs due to the effects of perspective and the relative size of the mountains compared to other visual cues in the environment, which change as Mike approaches the mountains."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It has great traditional culture, especially Chinese characters. Chinese characters usually have more than one meaning and some of them are very interesting. Here are six ones. We use \\"pinyin\\" here because \\"pinyin\\" is the Chinese spelling way for the characters. For example, \\"fu\\" is the \\"pinyin\\" for good luck in Chinese. \\"pinyin\\" \\"fu\\" is only the phonic part of the character and if you want to know the meaning of good luck \\"fu\\", you must read Chinese character  because \\"fu\\" also represents  other Chinese characters that sound the same. \\"fu\\" means blessing, good fortune, good luck. Chinese _ \\"fu\\" is one of the most popular ones used during Chinese New Year. Chinese people often put up \\"fu\\" upside down on the front door of a house or an apartment. The upside down \\"fu\\" means good luck comes since the character for upside down in Chinese sounds the same as the character for \\"come\\". \\"lu\\" is used to mean official's a pay in old China. \\"shou\\" means long life, age or birthday. \\"xi\\" is happiness, The doubled character \\"xi\\" means double happiness. It is usually put up everywhere at Chinese weddings. \\"cai\\" is weath or money. Chinese often say \\" money can make a ghost turn a millstone\\". It is to say money really can do a lot of things.

Gatorade replaces electrolytes and the boy misheard that information and asked what he thought it meant .. Explanation:  In the context provided, the boy, Geoffrey, presumably misunderstood the purpose of Gatorade. Gatorade is famously known for replenishing electrolytes in the body, which is probably the information the boy misunderstood or misheard and hence inquired if it is for light replacement.  Here's why other options are wrong: B). None of the above choices .. - Disregarded, as at least one choice is correct and applicable. C). Because the lights burnt out in his room and he thought the Gatorade would help replace them .. - There's no mention or hint in the text about any lights burning out in his room which makes this choice easily dismissible. D). Because he thought the Gatorade would make it light outside so he could ride his bike again .. - This option is highly improbable. The boy is sick, but there's nothing to suggest that he ties Gatorade to changing the outside lighting conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Select the topic that this about: Three second-half goals keep Arsenal's unbeaten record alive in a controversial encounter.","output":"Three second-half goals keep Arsenal's unbeaten record alive in a controversial encounter Summary: In a match filled with contentious decisions and high emotions, Arsenal managed to maintain their unbeaten record in dramatic fashion. With a comeback spurred on by three outstanding second-half goals, Arsenal overcame a difficult challenge from their tenacious opponents. As the match progressed, there were some dubious officiating decisions, igniting the fury of players on both sides of the field. The game will be remembered not only for its grit, determination, and tactical masterclass but also for the controversy that will continue to spark debates among football fans. Prelude: As the two teams prepared for battle, Arsenal knew that they had an impressive unbeaten record to uphold. Their opponents, aware of the task at hand, were determined to bring about Arsenal’s first loss of the season. Both sides exhibited confidence, but there was an underlying tension as the match commenced, knowing that the stakes were high. First Half: The first half could be best described as cagey, with both teams focusing on not conceding a goal. Defenses seemed to be on top, but there were a few half-chances as the game began to open up. Arsenal's opponents were growing in confidence and appeared to be gaining momentum. The first controversial moment occurred when Arsenal felt they had a legitimate claim for a penalty. However, the referee waved play on, sparking the first signs of animosity on the field. Towards the end of the first half, Arsenal's opponents capitalized on a momentary lapse in concentration in Arsenal’s backline. They scored what seemed to be a crucial goal, leading 1-0 going into halftime. This gave them a potentially decisive advantage, but the match was far from over. Second Half: Setting aside frustration from the contentious first half, Arsenal approached the second half with renewed focus and determination. A pivotal moment occurred when Arsenal were awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position. Their star player stepped up and unleashed an unstoppable curling shot, nestling it into the top corner, sparking wild celebrations among the Arsenal faithful and tying the game at 1-1. This goal instilled confidence into Arsenal’s play, and they began to dominate possession. Still, they had to be wary of their opponents, who were still posing a threat on the counter-attack. As the game approached the final 20 minutes, another controversial moment arose, with Arsenal's opponents feeling aggrieved after a strong penalty appeal was dismissed by the referee. This decision led to heated exchanges between players from both teams and further intensified an already emotionally charged game. Undeterred by distractions, Arsenal's persistence eventually paid off as they took the lead through a well-taken strike from their influential midfielder, who drilled a low shot past the outstretched goalkeeper, making the score 2-1. In the dying minutes, Arsenal's opponents threw everything forward in search of an equalizer, but it was Arsenal who had the last laugh, scoring a decisive third goal on the break. The dynamic winger showed exceptional pace to outpace the defense before calmly sliding the ball into the net, sealing Arsenal's victory at 3-1. Conclusion: After a hard-fought win, Arsenal's unbeaten record remained intact, but the game would be remembered for the controversial decisions that caused high emotions on and off the pitch. Debates will continue as fans critique the match, but ultimately, the character and determination of Arsenal shone through as they emerged victoriously despite the odds stacked against them. This comeback will go down in history as one of Arsenal's most memorable encounters, and the team will look to build upon this momentum for the remainder of the season."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

When we arrived (earlier than most) we were told they were 45 double beds short. We reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed. We had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away. Little did we know we were being CHARGED a daily fee for this bed. The managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel. The bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night. The managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating. We were so disappointed in this hotel. Also, they do not have a pool here. If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay 20 a day to use it. 80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous.

Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep.

In this sentence, the punctuation has been fixed by adding a comma after the word \\"Fjord,\\" which makes the sentence easier to read and improves its flow. Before the correction, the sentence seemed to be running together, causing confusion for readers. This additional comma allows a slight pause between the two related but not dependent clauses in the sentence. The first clause describes the beauty of the Tasiusaq Fjord: \\"It was wonderful to see the shining waters of Tasiusaq Fjord.\\" The second clause discusses the necessity of carrying gear over land: \\"even though it had been necessary for us to carry our gear over land to get there.\\" Proper punctuation is essential in written communication because it provides cues to the reader on how to interpret the sentence structure. Punctuation marks like commas help separate phrases and ideas, ensuring that the sentence's intended meaning is clear and easy to understand. Without appropriate punctuation, the meaning of a sentence might become unclear or ambiguous. It could also make the text harder to comprehend, forcing readers to re-read sentences to figure out the intended message. In this particular sentence, the addition of a comma after \\"Fjord\\" ensures that the message is conveyed more efficiently, as it separates the two clauses - one describing the beauty of the Fjord and the other explaining the effort to reach it. This separation enhances the readability of the sentence, making it easier for readers to understand the experiences and emotions of the person who has visited the Tasiusaq Fjord. Consequently, the corrected sentence not only provides a clear description of the Fjord and the journey required to reach it but also allows readers to visualize and appreciate the majestic beauty of this natural wonder."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other. Although they both mention rivers, Iminog and Cleja, in Romania, they present distinctly different pieces of information about the tributary relationships between the two rivers. 1. In the first sentence, it states that the Cleja River is a tributary of the Iminog River in Romania. This means that the Cleja River flows into and joins the Iminog River. In terms of hierarchy, the Cleja River is a smaller or subsidiary river that merges into the larger main river, which in this case is the Iminog River. 2. In contrast, the second sentence states that the River Iminog is a tributary of the River Cleja in Romania. This sentence conveys a completely different relationship between the rivers. In this case, it is implying that the Iminog River is a tributary that flows into the Cleja River, meaning that the Iminog River is the smaller or subsidiary river, while the Cleja River is the main river. In summary, the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other because they communicate different tributary relationships between the Cleja River and the Iminog River in Romania. The first sentence establishes the Cleja River as a tributary of the Iminog River, while the second sentence presents the Iminog River as a tributary of the Cleja River."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The paragraph provided only states that Damontre Moore was drafted in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft, but it does not specify the exact pick number. Each NFL Draft round consists of 32 selections (picks), with each of the league's 32 teams having one selection per round unless trades or other maneuvers affect the original order. To better understand why we cannot confirm the statement's accuracy, let's dive deeper into the 2013 NFL Draft and Damontre Moore's draft position. In the 2013 NFL Draft, Damontre Moore was selected in the third round by the New York Giants. Given that there are 32 teams in the NFL, the first two rounds of the draft would already encompass 64 selections (32 for each round). When we look at the third round of the draft, Damontre Moore was picked as the 81st overall selection. In other words, he was the 17th pick of the third round, not the 10th. Therefore, based on the information given and the additional context about the 2013 NFL Draft, we cannot conclude that the statement \\"Damontre Moore was the 10th pick in the 2013 NFL Draft\\" is true.

Article: A new plan for getting children to and from school is being started by the education authorities in part of Eastern England. This could end the worries of many parents fearful for their children's safety on the roads. Until now the Country Council has only been prepared to provide bus services for children living more than three miles from their school, or sometimes less if special reasons existed. Now it has been decided that if a group of parents ask for help in organizing transport they will be prepared to go ahead, provided the arrangement will not lose money and that children taking part will be attending their nearest school. The new scheme is to be tried out this term for children living at Milton who attend Impington school. The children live just within the three-mile limit and the Council has said in the past it will not undertake to provide free transport to the school. But now they have agreed to organize a bus service from Milton to Impington and back, a plan which has the support of the school's headmaster. Between 50 and 60 parents have said they would like their children to take part. Final calculations have still to be carried out, but a council official has said the cost to parents should be less than PS6. 50 a term. They have been able to arrange the service at a low cost because there is already an agreement with the bus company for a bus to take children who live further away to Impington. The same bus would now just make an extra journey to pick up the Milton children. The official said they would get in touch with other groups of parents who in the past had asked if transport could be provided for their children, to see if they would like to take part in the new scheme. Question: The children the Council ran buses for in the past were those  _  .

The mountains; Given those answer options, answer the question: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Look for it? Sure...but don't spend a lifetime trying, especially if it's well within your reach but you're just too blind to see it. Discover the three keys to happiness that you have already understood, but that you are just too afraid to find it. 1. Accepting Yourself The idea of happiness is difficult to understand if you are not at peace with yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are. Your next step will be to improve your attitude for tomorrow, for the next day, for the day after that, and so forth. By beginning to accept reality, you will come to the final point of true happiness. Only when you are at peace with yourself, will you finally be able to admit  that you are, in fact, a happy person. 2. Forgiving Others Forgiving others is a true show of humanity  which also allows us to feel more at ease. When you learn to forgive, you also learn to keep a firm hold on your life. To forgive is to open the doors of personal satisfaction. Yet you simply open your mind to answer, \\" Do I really want to allow my anger to grow and eat me from inside out?\\" 3. Helping Your Neighbors When a friend seems to be suffering from a state of depression  , it's quite easy to help him or her out of the trouble. The best attitude to have in this situation is to make him or her understand that he or she is not alone. If you come to save a friend in need, you'll feel a lot more at peace with yourself. You will feel high--spirited by knowing that someone is looking at life on the brighter side thanks to your kind words. ,.

Question: Question: \\"Where are antibiotics banned for animals?\\"  Context: \\"The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Antibiotics are banned for animals in the UK since 1970, following the Swann report in 1969, and the EU has prohibited their use as growth-promotional agents since 2003.

The Idea of robots fighting each other is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, real human action laughable, acting non-existent and special effects (on which, this type of movie must depend) are archaic.

Assessing the user's tone: The user starts off by expressing their negative feelings about the movie. They use critical words like \\"awful,\\" \\"ridiculous,\\" and \\"laughable.\\" 2. Identifying positive points: The user likes the idea of robots fighting each other, and is open to a potential remake. 3. Identifying specific negative points: The user believes the storyline is weak, the acting is poor, and the special effects are dated. They also find the human action laughable, and compare the movie unfavorably to another film, \\"Aliens\\", which was released five years prior. 4.

Given the background: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects.  and the situation: Two villages had many inhabitants practicing horticulture. People from Valley village grew flowers and used arthropodes and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Granite village used arthropods and snails, they cultivated them for food.  Answer the following question: Which village knew more about bee pollination?
