This article: \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is the best known piece from Thespis, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful operas, The Pirates of Penzance. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted.

Clinic counselor Dr. Vinnie Donatti (Alan King) explains that the clinic has a 100% success rate due to a uniquely persuasive method: every time Dick smokes a cigarette, horrors of increasing magnitude will befall his wife and child. Using the tomcat that Donatti's assistant Junk has caught in the street, Donatti demonstrates the first of these horrors: the cat is locked in a cage and tormented with electric shocks. Donatti explains that if his new client should be caught with a cigarette, Dick's wife Cindy will be subjected to the same shocks while he is forced to watch. For subsequent infractions, his young daughter afflicted with Down Syndrome will be subjected to the shocks, then his wife raped, and after the fourth infraction, they give up (i.e. kill him). Not wanting to worry them, Dick hides the looming threat from his family. That night, Dick is angered by the methods Quitters uses and notices an undisposed pack of cigarettes in his desk.

Hypothesis: A man on a green motorcycle. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, as the hypothesis is a part of the premise and does not contradict or create any discrepancies within the given information. Let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis in detail to visualize the underlying reasoning behind this conclusion. Premise: \\"A man on a green motorcycle speeding up the road\\" In the premise, we are given three distinct pieces of information: 1. There is a man involved in the scenario. 2. The man is on a green motorcycle. 3. The man and the motorcycle are speeding up the road. Now let's examine the hypothesis: Hypothesis: \\"A man on a green motorcycle\\" The hypothesis contains two of the three pieces of information mentioned in the premise: 1. There is a man involved in the scenario. 2. The man is on a green motorcycle. While comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe that the hypothesis is a simpler version of the premise, excluding only the action \\"speeding up the road.\\" However, since this information is not contradictory to the other details present in both the premise and the hypothesis, it doesn't compromise the validity of the hypothesis when considering the premise to be true. In other words, both pieces of information in the hypothesis are directly derived from the premise, making the hypothesis true if the premise is true. Additionally, it's important to note that the omitted action \\"speeding up the road\\" in the hypothesis does not affect the truth of the statement \\"a man on a green motorcycle.\\" The hypothesis focuses on the presence of a man on a green motorcycle, whether or not the individual is in motion or at rest. Since the motion aspect is a separate variable, removing it does not alter the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise provided. In conclusion, when accepting the premise as true, we can rightfully deduce that the hypothesis is also true. The man being on a green motorcycle is undeniable in both the premise and the hypothesis, solidifying the soundness of the hypothesis under the given conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Joe was an old man. The 75-year-old lived very happily in a village and had a beautiful family. Joe had four grandchildren, and they visited him during their holidays. During one vacation, Joe was preparing his home for the kids: cleaning and buying their favorite foods. After he finished working, he realized he lost his favorite watch. The watch was a gift from his wife when their first child was born. Joe loved the watch very much, especially after his wife's death. He was very upset about losing it. Once his grandchildren came, they promised him they would find the watch. One granddaughter asked: \\"Grandpa, do you remember when you saw the watch last before it went missing?\\" \\"I guess when I was cleaning the barn !\\" Joe replied. The children looked for more than two hours with Joe, but they could not find it. The kids were now also sad, but they tried to comfort  their grandfather. One grandson went back to the barn to search again. Joe asked why he was going there a second time. But the little boy just asked the others not to follow him and to remain silent. He was there for about fifteen minutes and then rushed to his grandfather. He found the watch and happily gave it to Joe. Joe was surprised and asked how he was able to find it. The little boy replied: \\"I sat there without making a noise, and the barn was so silent.

Upon entering the room, the child sat quietly and patiently, allowing the barn to fall into a state of silence. As he waited, he began to listen intently for any subtle sound that might provide a clue to the watch's location. After a few minutes passed, his efforts paid off, as he started to hear the soft, rhythmic sound of the watch ticking. Guided by this faint noise, the grandson was able to locate the missing watch and triumphantly return it to his overjoyed grandfather.

Which is the oldest college of Cambridge University?","output":"Peterhouse College is the oldest college of the prestigious University of Cambridge. It was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely, in an attempt to establish an intellectual community that would pursue knowledge and learning in the town of Cambridge. Hugh de Balsham sought to encourage scholarship among the students after observing that students in the town needed formal teaching institutions due to the lack of regulation, as they were solely living together and receiving informal instruction from teachers. The establishment of Peterhouse marked the beginning of the collegiate system that distinguishes Cambridge University today. Peterhouse initially comprised just two main buildings: the original hostelry (now known as Bishop's Hostel) and a hall, which served as a common dining area and study space for the scholars. The students admitted to Peterhouse were mainly focused on the study of theology, with some emphasis on subjects like arts and law. Later, the college expanded its focus to include a wider variety of subjects, keeping up with the evolving academic environment. Throughout its history, Peterhouse has undergone significant architectural and physical developments. The college expanded its facilities following the growth and success of the institution, constructing new libraries, gardens, and accommodation buildings. Some of the most notable expansions include the construction of the Perne Library in the late 16th century and the addition of the Chapel, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, in the 17th century. Additionally, the Ward Library was established in the 19th century as a repository for books and manuscripts. Today, Peterhouse is a small college, consisting of approximately 260 students and 45 fellows, representing diverse academic fields. Despite its small size, the college boasts a distinguished list of alumni, including five Nobel laureates, one British Prime Minister, and several notable figures in the fields of mathematics, literature, and science. As the oldest college of Cambridge University, Peterhouse has played a crucial role in shaping the academic landscape of not only Cambridge but the entire United Kingdom. Its founding principles of scholarly pursuit and communal living continue to resonate with its students and faculty, making Peterhouse a distinguished and integral part of the Cambridge tradition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cancers that spread to the lymph nodes around the pelvic region increase the risk for a recurrence of prostate cancer later on.","output":"Additionally, the aggressiveness of the cancer at the time of diagnosis, as indicated by the Gleason score, plays a significant role in the likelihood of recurrence. A high Gleason score suggests a more aggressive cancer type with a higher propensity to return after treatment. It is crucial for patients to maintain regular follow-up appointments with their healthcare team for accurate and timely monitoring of potential cancer recurrence, enabling appropriate and prompt intervention if needed. Other risk factors that contribute to prostate cancer recurrence include the presence of positive surgical margins after a prostatectomy, indicating that some cancerous tissue may have been left behind, and the status of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level post-treatment. A rising PSA level may signal the return of cancerous cells, necessitating further evaluation and potential treatment adjustments. Moreover, genetic predisposition, family history, and personal lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise habits, may also influence a person's risk for prostate cancer recurrence.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed suggests that there is more lava cooling from the eruption. In this scenario, if more lava cools and forms new crust, it could have several effects on the process, and may lead to less or smaller eruptions. 1. Thicker Crust: If more lava cools to form a thicker crust, it might make it more difficult for magma to rise through the cracks and reach the surface. This resistance could result in less frequent eruptions or smaller eruptions, as the magma would need greater pressure to break through the Earth's crust. 2. More Pressure Buildup: With more lava cooling and solidifying, the pressure within the Earth's mantle might build up more gradually. This could lead to less frequent eruptions but potentially larger ones when the pressure finally overcomes the increased resistance of the thicker crust. 3. Change in Plate Movements: As additional lava forms a new crust and adds mass to the tectonic plates, this could affect the way the plates move and interact with each other, either decreasing or increasing the likelihood of volcanic eruptions in certain areas. 4. Change in Volcano Formation: If more lava from the eruption cools around the vent, it may alter the way a volcano forms. This could potentially lead to different types of volcanic structures, which may affect the frequency and magnitude of eruptions. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more lava cooling from an eruption could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of volcanic eruptions. It may lead to less frequent or smaller eruptions due to increased resistance from a thicker crust, changes in pressure buildup, alterations in plate movements, and differences in how volcanoes form. However, these effects are highly dependent on various factors, such as the type of volcanoes, tectonic settings, and magma composition, making it difficult to predict exact outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Buried with him were the tools of a hunter or warrior. There was a bone pin that may have been from a piece of clothing such as a leather coat. He carried a copper knife on his breast. The most amazing find was two gold earrings. That would have made him a man of distinction. Only a few centimeters from his head were two pots made of clay, tools and materials to make arrows, a bow and a dozen arrows for hunting and a second, smaller copper knife. Next to them lay a cushion stone, upon which the man could work metal. His grave is the richest of any found from that period, because this man was buried with two gold earrings which are the oldest gold ever found in Britain (dated to 2470 BC). Besides, he was buried three miles from Stonehenge. Archaeologists tend to believe he was a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge. Stonehenge was begun around 3000 BC. In about 2300 BC the huge stone circles were built. The biggest stone weighed approximately 20 tons. But the smaller blue stones, still weighing 4 tons on average, came from west Wales. It is not yet known how these were conveyed over a distance of 380 km. It is also a mystery how early man was able to construct Stonehenge without the use of modern construction machines and lorries.

No. The correct answer is not \\"Wood has always been used extensively for furniture, such as chairs and beds.\\" The question is asking about specific wooden utensils that many people use to eat Chinese takeout. A more appropriate answer would be: Many people use wooden chopsticks when eating Chinese takeout. Chopsticks are traditional eating utensils and have been used for over 2,000 years in China. These elongated sticks are held in one's dominant hand and are usually made from bamboo, although they can be made from other materials such as metal, plastic, or wood. Wooden chopsticks are the most commonly used type for Chinese takeout due to their natural, eco-friendly properties and lightweight nature. Chopsticks require a certain level of acquired dexterity and skill, which differs from conventional Western utensils such as forks and knives. They are typically used for manipulation and transportation of small, bite-sized food items from a shared dish to one's mouth or personal plate. The cultural significance of chopsticks in Chinese cuisine extends beyond their practical use as eating utensils. They carry symbolic meanings, such as representing good fortune and auspiciousness, especially during holidays and celebrations. In Chinese takeout, wooden chopsticks are often provided as disposable utensils to support hygiene, ensuring they are only used once. They are usually connected at the top end and require the user to snap them apart before use.

Police said in a news release Sunday afternoon that Cattrall’s body was found on that property.      “The investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death will continue by the RCMP, but preliminary information indicates that his death is not being considered suspicious,” RCMP said in the release.      Police said they would not be commenting further on the case out of respect for the family.      Kim Cattrall, who was born in the U.K. but spent much of her childhood in Canada, had said in an earlier Instagram post that her brother’s keys, cellphone and wallet were left on a table in the house, and his front door was unlocked and his seven dogs were left alone.      Police did not confirm those details.      RCMP Cpl. Laurel Scott said earlier Sunday that a relative checked Cattrall’s home on Friday and that’s when police were notified he was missing. She said police and search and rescue had checked the property.      Police issued a news release asking for the public’s help finding him, and Kim Cattrall also made an appeal online      “He’s a one of a kind brother,” Kim Cattrall wrote in her earlier social media post. “Help us bring him home safe.” ||||| Add this Tweet to your website by copying the code below. مزید جانیئے      Add this video to your website by copying the code below. مزید جانیئے      ہہم، سرور تک پہنچنے میں ایک مسئلہ تھا۔ دوبارہ کوشش کریں؟ بنیادی ٹویٹ شامل کریں میڈیا شامل کریں      ٹوئٹر کا مواد اپنی ویب سائٹ یا ایپلی کیشن میں ایمبیڈ کر کے، آپ ٹوئٹر کے ڈیولپر اقرارنامہ اور ڈیولپر پالیسی سے اتفاق کر رہے ہیں۔      پیش منظر ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Actress Kim Cattrall announced the death of her brother, Chris Cattrall, on Twitter after he was reported missing in Canada.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  The Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain, but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote: There is plenty of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares. They sell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be supposed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common domestic fowls.\\" In the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle.

As they speed across a bridge, the women's car plunges over the side into the river. The police spend three hours dragging the murky, fast-running water without success. Mary miraculously surfaces, but she cannot remember how she survived. Mary then drives to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist.

Shortly thereafter, while she is speeding along a deserted stretch of road, a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (never identified, but called \\"The Man\\" in dialogue and played by director Herk Harvey, uncredited) replaces her reflection in the passenger window and stares at her. When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road.

In town, Mary rents a room from Mrs. Thomas; John Linden, the only other lodger, wants to become better acquainted with the blonde newcomer, but she is not interested.

More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\".

Question: Given the following context:  The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: how to make holiday party mix","output":"Both solutions have their own merits and what might be better for one person, might not suit another. However, to properly assess and recommend the better of these two options, it's essential to provide an in-depth analysis of both methods for preparing the holiday party mix. Solution 1: DIY Homemade Holiday Party Mix In this method, you make the holiday party mix from scratch using a combination of snacks, candies, and other festive ingredients. Here's a suggested recipe for creating a delicious and versatile homemade holiday party mix: Ingredients: - 2 cups mini pretzels - 2 cups rice or corn Chex cereal - 1 cup mixed nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pecans) - 1 cup holiday M&M's or other festive candy - 1 cup dried cranberries or raisins - 1 cup mini marshmallows - Optional: 1 cup of chocolate or white chocolate chips, popcorn, or other small seasonal candies Instructions: 1. In a large bowl, mix together pretzels, Chex cereal, and mixed nuts. 2. Add in the M&M's and dried cranberries, then gently mix until combined. 3. Mix in the mini marshmallows and any optional ingredients, like chocolate chips or popcorn. 4. Store the holiday party mix in an airtight container or divide into individual serving bags for guests. Advantages of Homemade Holiday Party Mix: - Customizable: You can choose your favorite ingredients, modify the recipe according to allergies or dietary preferences, and make it as sweet, salty, or healthy as you'd like. - Freshness: A homemade mix is often fresher, as you can control the ingredients' quality and decide when to make it. - Budget-friendly: Making your own mix often allows for cost savings as you choose the ingredients, determine the portion size, and avoid any high-priced commercial options. Disadvantages of Homemade Holiday Party Mix: - Time-consuming: Making the mix from scratch takes time, which might be a constraint if you're very busy with holiday preparations. - Inconsistent results: There might be variations in the taste and overall appearance each time you make the mix, especially if you use different ingredients or proportions. Solution 2: Store-bought Holiday Party Mix This method involves purchasing a pre-made holiday party mix from a grocery store or online marketplace. Many brands offer festive and tasty mixes that cater to various tastes and preferences. Advantages of Store-bought Holiday Party Mix: - Convenience: Purchasing a pre-made mix is convenient and time-saving, simply open the bag and serve. - Consistency: The taste, appearance, and proportions of ingredients in a store-bought mix will be consistent each time you buy it. - Variety: There are several holiday party mix choices available in the market, catering to various taste preferences and dietary restrictions. Disadvantages of Store-bought Holiday Party Mix: - Limited customization: You will have limited control over the mix's ingredients, which might be an issue for people with specific allergies or dietary preferences. - Cost: Pre-made holiday party mixes might be more expensive than creating your own, especially if you choose a high-end or gourmet product. Conclusion: The better solution for making holiday party mix ultimately depends on your personal preferences, time constraints, and desired level of customization. If you enjoy preparing your own recipes and have specific ingredient preferences, then the DIY homemade holiday party mix is likely a better choice. However, if convenience, time-saving, and consistency are more important to you, a store-bought holiday party mix could be the better solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay.  However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno). Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on.

Options: a ) 0.4 % , b ) 0.8 % , c ) 2 % , d ) 4 % , e ) 8 % Solution:","output":"To solve this problem, we'll analyze the change in gross income from the sales in terms of the percent changes. Let's represent the original gross income as G, the number of items sold as N, and the price of each item as P. The formula for gross income is: G = N * P Now, let's consider the changes after the couple applies a 10% discount on every item and the number of items sold increases by 12%. 1. The new price after a 10% discount is 90% of the original price: New price = 0.9 * P 2. The new number of items sold after the 12% increase: New number of items = 1.12 * N Now, let's calculate the new gross income (G_new) using these values: G_new = (1.12 * N) * (0.9 * P) To determine the percent increase in gross income, we calculate the difference between the new and old gross incomes, then divide by the original gross income and multiply by 100. Percent Increase = [(G_new - G) / G] * 100 Substituting G = N * P and G_new = (1.12 * N) * (0.9 * P): Percent Increase = [((1.12 * N) * (0.9 * P) - N * P) / (N * P)] * 100 Simplify by factoring out N*P: Percent Increase = [((1.12 * 0.9) - 1) * 100] Percent Increase = [(1.008 - 1) * 100] Percent Increase = [0.008 * 100] Percent Increase = 0.8 % So, the couple's gross income from sales for one month increases by 0.8%.

Article: Students who want to attend an American university must explain how they will pay for their education. They have to show that they will be able to pay for each year of study. Students have to consider not only the tuition, the cost of classes, but also meals and a place to live in, which is known as room-and-board. They also need money for books and supplies. And they need money to spend on social activities and other things.   Educational advisers say foreign students should have enough money in a local bank to pay for at least two months of expenditure . So how much will a year at an American school cost? Generally speaking, the answer is: a lot. A leading state university in the Pacific Northwest will serve as an example. The University of Washington says foreign students are paying more than 36,000 this year. This major research university currently has 2,600 foreign students from more than 100 countries. There are many schools that cost less, but also others that cost more. Its web site says the University of Washington does not offer financial assistance to international students. This is generally true of American schools, especially at the undergraduate level. The international application for the university includes a Statement of Financial Responsibility that must be signed. Students must also provide a bank letter or statement from within the past six months. And they have to name someone who will help with payments. These people must send proof from a bank to show that they have the money. Your government or employer may be able to help you pay all or some of the college costs. A good idea is to ask at least eighteen months before you want to start classes in the United States.  Our Foreign Student Services, including links to web sites discussed in our reports, can be found at www.unsv.com. To learn more about higher education in America, the State Department has a special web site: educationusa.state.gov. Question: What is the speaker's purpose in this speech? Options: A: To tell foreign students that money is the most important thing in the US. B: To advise foreign students to apply as soon as possible so as to have more chances. C: To state some requirements foreign students should pay attention to when applying for colleges. D: To tell people about the present situation of foreign students in the US.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister. I think the experience made us both content to elope.

He is brutally beaten and forced to crack rocks with a hammer (under the prisoner number 3½).Bugs fools Sam into letting him escape by stuffing his leg iron into a cannon and being fired over the prison wall.

In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible.

Translate to Romanian","output":"Conservarea biodiversității trebuie să fie o prioritate pentru acțiunea noastră politică. Biodiversitatea se referă la varietatea de forme de viață care există pe Terra, inclusiv diversitatea genetică din cadrul speciilor, diversitatea speciilor în sine și diversele ecosisteme și habitaturi în care acestea trăiesc. Păstrarea biodiversității oferă numeroase beneficii, cum ar fi protecția resurselor de hrană, apă și subsol, minimizarea riscului de dezastre naturale și îmbunătățirea calității vieții noastre prin menținerea unui mediu sănătos și echilibrat. Importanța conservării biodiversității a devenit din ce în ce mai evidentă în ultimii ani, în timp ce oamenii au început să observe efectele deteriorării mediului înconjurător, dispariția habitatului și extincția speciilor la nivel global. Astfel, trebuie să fim conștienți de rolul pe care diversitatea biologică îl joacă în menținerea vieții pe Pământ și să ne axăm eforturile politice pe protejarea și conservarea acestei bogății naturale. Una dintre metodele cheie pentru acțiunea politică în conservarea biodiversității este dezvoltarea unor politici și legi care să reglementeze activitățile umane și să reducă impactul negativ asupra mediului înconjurător. De exemplu, implementarea unor legi care să protejeze habitatele fragile, să limiteze extracția excesivă de resurse, să controleze poluarea și să prevină fragmentarea pământului poate contribui într-o mare măsură la păstrarea biodiversității. În plus, politica trebuie să promoveze cercetarea și educația în domeniul biodiversității, pentru a încuraja o mai bună înțelegere a acestei probleme și pentru a dezvolta strategii de conservare eficiente. De asemenea, cooperarea internațională este crucială în acest proces, având în vedere că biodiversitatea este o problemă globală ce necesită acțiuni concertate și coordonate între țări. Investițiile în programe de conservare, de refacere a habitatelor și de gestionare durabilă a resurselor naturale sunt, de asemenea, esențiale pentru conservarea biodiversității. Acest lucru înseamnă că guvernele trebuie să aloce fonduri adecvate și să implice sectorul privat și comunitățile locale în aceste eforturi. Toate aceste acțiuni politice, în combinație cu eforturi de conștientizare la nivel individual, vor ajuta la protejarea și conservarea biodiversității, asigurând un viitor mai sănătos și mai prosper pentru noi toți și pentru generațiile care vor urma.

The reviewer notes that the rubber/plastic casing tends to get damaged, and the band needs to be replaced after years of heavy use. Furthermore, they reveal their disappointment in the watch's alarm feature, as the high tones cannot be heard due to their hearing loss. Lastly, the reviewer shares a concern related to water resistance, recounting an incident when the watch leaked, but acknowledges it continued working after drying out. Overall, the sentiment of the review is positive, as the user appears to be content with the watch's performance and design while acknowledging a few flaws. The fact that the reviewer continues to purchase G-shock watches after 25 years is a strong indication of their satisfaction with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The man was elderly, unshaven and ragged. Passers-by wanted nothing to do with him. But the woman smiled. \\"Are you hungry?\\" she asked. The man slowly looked up. This was a woman clearly used to the finer things in life. Her coat was new. She looked like that she had never missed a meal in her life. \\"No, \\" he answered sarcastically . \\"I've just come from dining with the president. Now go away. \\"To his surprise, the woman continued standing. And her smile became even broader.     \\"What are you doing, lady?\\" he asked angrily. \\"I said to leave me alone. \\"   Just then a policeman came up. \\"Is there any problem, ma'am?\\" He asked.    \\"No problem here, officer,\\" the woman answered. \\"I'm just trying to get this man to his feet. Will you help me?\\"     The officer scratched  his head. \\"That's old Jack. He's been around here for a couple of years. What do you want with him?\\"     \\"See that cafeteria over there?\\" She asked. \\"I'm going to get him something to eat and get him out of the cold. \\"   \\"Are you crazy, lady? I don't want to go in there!\\" Then the homeless felt strong hands lift him up. \\"Let me go, officer. I didn't do anything.\\"     \\"This is a good deal for you, Jack, \\"the officer answered. \\"Don't blow it. \\"     Finally, the woman and the police officer got Jack into the cafeteria and sat him at a table. It was the middle of the morning, so most of the breakfast crowd had already left and the lunch bunch had not yet arrived. The woman turned to the officer, \\"Would you like to join us in a cup of coffee and a meal, officer?\\"   \\"Yes, ma'am. That would be very nice. \\"   Then, she sat down at the table across from her amazed dinner guest.

A) some people get help just when they need it B) the cup of coffee is going to taste as sweet as sugar C) Jack was paid back for his kindness so many years later D) Eddy achieved her Success through painstaking efforts in the end Answer:","output":"C) Jack was paid back for his kindness so many years later. The story recounted by the woman, Penelope Eddy, reveals that in her time of need many years ago, when she was a young, cold, and hungry college student, it was Old Jack who had shown her kindness. As she entered the cafeteria where Jack once worked, he had helped her by providing a warm meal, giving her hope, and perhaps even indirectly contributing to her future success. Now, finding Jack in a similar situation to her own years earlier, Penelope extends the same kindness toward him that he had given to her. She helps him by providing a meal, including the police officer and involving him in a meaningful conversation. This act of kindness from Penelope represents the repayment of Jack's earlier generosity, creating a full circle moment in their lives. The police officer refers to this encounter as a miracle because it is a rare and heartwarming event where the roles have been reversed, and someone who was once in great need is now able to help the one who initially supported them. It highlights the idea that sometimes, good deeds may come back to benefit us in unexpected ways, further emphasizing the importance of being kind to others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Speaking two languages can actually help offset  some effects of aging on the brain, a new study has found. Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive  task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual  , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \\"a beautiful natural experiment\\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \\"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\\" he said. \\"Actually, it's beneficial. \\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

It gives its name to several landmarks, including Charing Cross railway station, one of the main London rail terminals.  - Hampstead (or ), commonly known as Hampstead Village, is an area of London, England, northwest of Charing Cross. Part of the London Borough of Camden, it is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations and for Hampstead Heath, a large, hilly expanse of parkland. It has some of the most expensive housing in the London area. The village of Hampstead has more millionaires within its boundaries than any other area of the United Kingdom.  - 2 Willow Road is part of a terrace of three houses in Hampstead , London designed by architect Ern Goldfinger and completed in 1939 . It has been managed by the National Trust since 1995 and is open to the public . It was one of the first modernist buildings acquired by the Trust , giving rise to some controversy . Goldfinger lived there with his wife Ursula and their children until his death in 1987 . 1 -- 3 Willow Road was constructed using concrete and a facing of red brick . A number of cottages were demolished to allow for the construction , which was strongly opposed by a number of local residents including novelist Ian Fleming ( this was said to be his inspiration for the name of the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger ) and the future Conservative Home Secretary Henry Brooke . No. 2 , which Goldfinger designed specifically as his own family home , is the largest of the three houses and features a spiral staircase designed by Danish engineer Ove Arup at its core . The building is supported by a concrete frame , part of which is external , leaving room for a spacious uncluttered interior , perhaps inspired by the Raumplan ideas of modernist architect Adolf Loos . Goldfinger himself designed much of the furniture in No. 2 , and the house also contains a significant collection of 20th - century art by Bridget Riley , Marcel Duchamp , Henry Moore and Max Ernst . Entry is by timed ticket , and facilities are very limited . Nos. 1 and 3 remain private homes .  - A tower block, high-rise, apartment tower, residential tower, apartment block, block of flats, or office tower is a tall building or structure used as a residential and/or office building. In some areas it may be referred to as an \\"MDU\\", standing for \\"Multi Dwelling Unit\\". In the United States, such a structure is referred to as an apartment building or office building, while a group of such buildings is called an apartment complex or office complex.  - Ern Goldfinger (11 September 1902  15 November 1987) was a Hungarian-born architect and designer of furniture. He moved to the United Kingdom in the 1930s, and became a key member of the Modernist architectural movement. He is most prominently remembered for designing residential tower blocks, some of which are now listed buildings.  - Hampstead Heath (locally known as \\"the heath\\") is a large, ancient London park, covering . This grassy public space sits astride a sandy ridge, one of the highest points in London, running from Hampstead to Highgate, which rests on a band of London Clay. The heath is rambling and hilly, embracing ponds, recent and ancient woodlands, a lido, playgrounds, and a training track, and it adjoins the former stately home of Kenwood House and its estate. The south-east part of the heath is Parliament Hill, from which the view over London is protected by law.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

An example of the directing: When Candy (Jean Peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. It's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just \\"clicks\\" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag. Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for \\"Moe,\\" the street peddler/informer, played by Thelma Ritter. Later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. I've never seen anyone \\"act\\" so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat.  About a million other things just *worked,* from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks Moe's hand away from her brooch, to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guy's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet, like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years. \\"Pickup On South Street\\" is detailed moves (directing) with consummate performances (acting) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the shack out on the water, the dumbwaiter, -- and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings. Wonderful stuff. \\"Pickup On South Street\\" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: Skip as a \\"three-time loser\\" and Candy as a youngish woman who has \\"knocked around\\" a lot. When these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human.

Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences. A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour. MS Alexandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \\"poet\\" or \\"writer\\" class). Station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour. The Pushkin Hills and Pushkin Lake were named in his honour in Ben Nevis Township, Cochrane District, in Ontario, Canada. UN Russian Language Day, established by the United Nations in 2010 and celebrated each year on 6 June, was scheduled to coincide with Pushkin's birthday.

If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

Write an article based on this summary: Leicestershire chief executive Wasim Khan says the club need new signings to improve their limited-overs results. Article:","output":"Title: Leicestershire County Cricket Club Seeks New Signings to Improve Limited-Overs Results Introduction: Leicestershire County Cricket Club's chief executive, Wasim Khan, recently spoke about the club's ongoing struggle to improve their limited-overs results in the recent seasons. Khan asserted that the club needs to invest in new signings to enhance their overall performance in shorter formats of the game, such as T20 and One-Day cricket. Considering the club's track record, it is evident that Leicestershire has been underperforming, especially during the Royal London One-Day Cup and the Vitality Blast T20 tournament. Current Situation: Leicestershire has faced a series of defeats and disappointments that have led to questions about the team's makeup and capabilities in limited-overs cricket. It is important to note that the club has had very few victories in the shorter format to boast of in the recent past. Despite the club's rich history, they have been struggling to recapture their success in the past few years. This places them at a critical juncture where the club must reassess its strengths, identify its weaknesses, and formulate a comprehensive strategy to recuperate. Wasim Khan's View: Khan's proposal of signing new players is well-founded, given that the current team has failed to make a significant impact in the limited-overs competitions. Bringing in fresh talent and experience could steer Leicestershire towards the road to success in both T20 and One-Day cricket. Wasim Khan envisions an exciting and rewarding future for the club and is determined to make the necessary changes to reignite its potential. Potential Signings: Leicestershire County Cricket Club will be assessing various domestic and international players as potential signings for the upcoming season. The club should focus on integrating a balanced mix of youth and experience, as it is essential to groom the younger talents under the guidance of seasoned players. Acquiring players with exceptional skills in batting, bowling, and fielding is imperative, as it elevates the team's overall capabilities, increases their chances of outperforming their opponents, and could encourage better performances from existing players. The Importance of Coaching and Support Staff: While new player signings are crucial, it is also vital that the club focuses on strengthening their coaching and support staff. The role of the coaching and support staff in honing the skills of the team members and creating a cohesive unit cannot be overlooked. Engaging experienced coaches and support staff can help the club maintain effective communication, instill discipline, and create strategies that maximize the potential of existing and new players alike. Conclusion: Leicestershire County Cricket Club is at a pivotal point in its journey to reestablish their dominance in limited-overs cricket. Wasim Khan's proposal for new signings is a crucial step towards achieving success in the T20 and One-Day formats. As the club seeks to turn a new leaf, it must prioritize a balanced blend of youth and experience with an exceptional skill set that helps enhance the overall team performance. Furthermore, investing in exceptional coaching and support staff will prove invaluable in creating a well-rounded and capable team. With these initiatives in place, Leicestershire can confidently look toward a bright and successful future in limited-overs cricket."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation. I cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.)

Tucker was born Sofya \\"Sonya\\" Kalish (in Russian, Sof'ia <<Sonia>> Kalish) in 1887 to a Jewish family en route to America from Tulchyn, Podolia Governorate, Russian Empire, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. (\\"Sonya\\" is a nickname for the name \\"Sofya\\", the Russian form of the name Sophie.) The family adopted the surname Abuza, settled in Hartford, Connecticut, and opened a restaurant. At a young age, she began singing at her parents' restaurant for tips. In 1907, Tucker made her first theater appearance, singing at an amateur night in a vaudeville establishment. It was here that she was first made to wear blackface during performance, as her producers thought that the crowd would tease her for being \\"so big and ugly.\\" By 1908, she had joined a burlesque show in Pittsburgh but was ashamed to tell her family that she was performing in a deep southern accent wearing burnt cork on her face. While touring later that year, luggage including her makeup kit was lost, and Tucker was allowed to go on stage without the blackface.  She then stunned the crowd by saying, \\"You all can see I'm a white girl. Well, I'll tell you something more: I'm not Southern. I'm a Jewish girl and I just learned this Southern accent doing a blackface act for two years. And now, Mr. Leader, please play my song.\\" Tucker also began integrating \\"fat girl\\" humor, which became a common thread in her acts. Her songs included \\"I Don't Want to Get Thin\\" and \\"Nobody Loves a Fat Girl, But Oh How a Fat Girl Can Love.\\"  In 1909, at the age of 22, Tucker performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. Though she was a hit, the other female stars refused to share the spotlight with her, and the company was forced to let her go. This caught the attention of William Morris, a theater owner and future founder of the William Morris Agency, which would become one of the largest and most powerful talent agencies of the era. Two years later, Tucker released \\"Some of These Days\\" on Edison Records, written by Shelton Brooks. The title of the song was later used as the title of Tucker's 1945 biography.  In 1921, Tucker hired pianist and songwriter Ted Shapiro as her accompanist and musical director, a position he would keep throughout her career. Besides writing a number of songs for her, Shapiro became part of her stage act, playing piano on stage while she sang, and exchanging banter and wisecracks with her in between numbers. Tucker remained a popular singer through the 1920s and became friends with stars such as Mamie Smith and Ethel Waters, who introduced her to jazz. Tucker learned from these talented women and became one of the first performers to introduce jazz to white vaudeville audiences.  In 1925, Jack Yellen wrote one of her most famous songs, \\"My Yiddishe Momme\\". The song was performed in large American cities where there were sizable Jewish audiences. Tucker explained, \\"Even though I loved the song and it was a sensational hit every time I sang it, I was always careful to use it only when I knew the majority of the house would understand Yiddish. However, you didn't have to be a Jew to be moved by My Yiddishe Momme.\\" During the Hitler regime, the song was banned by the German government for evoking Jewish culture. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"\\"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article. Some of them include: 1. Tucker's initial performances involved her wearing blackface, a practice she later abandoned after an incident where her makeup kit was lost. 2.

A blacklight (or often black light), also referred to as a UV-A light, Wood's lamp, or simply ultraviolet light, is a lamp that emits long-wave (UV-A) ultraviolet light and not much visible light. Is it true that are black lights and uv lights the same thing?","output":"Yes, black lights and UV lights refer to the same type of light source, but it is essential to understand the distinctions within the broader category of ultraviolet (UV) light. Ultraviolet light is a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light but longer than X-rays. It is present in sunlight and has various applications like disinfection, air purification, and fluorescence. The term UV light encompasses a range of wavelengths divided into three subcategories: UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C. Black lights primarily emit UV-A light, which is the least harmful type of UV radiation. It is often referred to as long-wave ultraviolet light, with wavelengths ranging from 320 to 400 nanometers. Black lights are typically used in environments where a unique type of illumination is required, such as in parties, concerts, or to make fluorescent materials glow in dark. In addition to their recreational use, black lights also play roles in detecting counterfeit currencies, analyzing artwork for repairs or forgeries, and identifying minerals in geology. UV lights, on the other hand, can also refer to the other two subcategories of ultraviolet radiation. UV-B light, with wavelengths ranging from 280 to 320 nanometers, is known for its effects on human health, such as an increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts with overexposure. UV-B radiation is essential, however, for the production of vitamin D in the human body. UV-C light, with wavelengths between 100 and 280 nanometers, constitutes the shortest and most destructive form of ultraviolet radiation. Because of its germicidal properties, it is extensively used in sterilization, disinfection, and water purification processes. UV-C is entirely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and does not reach the surface. Artificially produced UV-C light sources, such as germicidal lamps or UV-C LED lights, serve various industrial and medical applications. In summary, black lights and UV lights can be considered the same thing in the context that both emit ultraviolet radiation. However, it is crucial to note that black lights specifically emit UV-A light, which has different applications and properties compared to the more harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation."},{"instruction":"What happens to airplanes when they hit the ground?

The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion: The pancreas is an essential part of the digestive system and releases enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and protease to help break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into simpler molecules that can be absorbed by the body. 4. Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood: The digested food components, such as glucose (from carbohydrates), amino acids (from proteins), and fatty acids (from fats), are absorbed into the bloodstream, which increases the blood sugar level. 5. The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level: In response to the elevated blood sugar level, the pancreas secretes the hormone insulin, which helps to lower blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose by the body's cells. 6. The pancreas releases another hormone to raise the blood sugar (glucose) level: If the blood sugar levels drop too low, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon, which acts to increase blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver and the release of glucose into the bloodstream."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kevin Pietersen's autobiography  has seemed to be an endless stream of sad score-settling. But while the former England batsman’s claims of a bullying culture are certainly worthy of investigation, it’s KP’s mass of contradictions that leap off the page. Here’s the best (or worst) of them… England's James Anderson (left) reacts with team-mates Kevin Pietersen (centre) and Graeme Swann after he takes a wicket against India during a Test at Lord's in 2011 Skating on thing ice After the removal of Peter Moores and Pietersen’s demotion from the captaincy, England travelled to the West Indies in early 2009. Pietersen relates that he ‘gave it my best’ upon being back in the ranks. ‘I had come to the Caribbean and gone out of my way to make things as smooth as possible for Straussy,’ he insists. He has always said that","output":"his relationship with the new captain, Andrew Strauss, was robust and unwavering. They shared an understanding and mutual respect on and off the field that would often be a source of strength during challenging times. However, this notion does raise eyebrows given the tension and controversy that later surrounded them. At times, he even suggests that the dressing room atmosphere improved with his own demotion. Pietersen goes on to elaborate on his relationship with each of his teammates, reiterating his claim that the bullying culture was something he stood against. He mentions Matt Prior, casting him in a less than flattering light, whom he alleges to be one of the proponents of this culture. The book is laced with such accusations, with Pietersen taking the opportunity to detail the incidents that led to his alienation within the team. Reminiscing of the time during the four-match Test series against South Africa, he explains how he felt lonely and ostracized. Despite scoring an impressive century in the second innings at Headingley, he emphasizes how it was a solitary one. He describes that this was the time he first felt rejected by his own team and started questioning his own place in it. His claim about swashbuckling all-rounder Ian Bell being insecure about his place in the team, despite being on the top of his game is an interesting perspective. According to Pietersen, an accomplished batsman like Bell feeling insecure was a clear indication of the level of fear and intimidation prevalent in the dressing room. Many of Pietersen’s accounts reveal a certain amount of self-pity and an apparent necessity to vindicate himself from all accusations ever made against him. The book provides, on many occasions, a blow-by-blow account of incidents detailing his high-octane journey through international cricket. This journey, according to Pietersen, is filled with a sense of betrayal and victimhood, primarily at the hands of his English teammates and the English Cricket Board(ECB). Yet, despite the influx of stinging revelations, Pietersen also acknowledges his culpability for certain actions. He admits he could've possibly handled situations better, communicated more effectively, instead of being grandiose or confrontational. However, it's his adamancy about not being the 'only' one that stands out. In this narrative journey, Pietersen certainly provides engrossing, and occasionally eyebrow-raising insight into the inner workings of international cricket, revealing the highs and lows of his tumultuous career. In ending, KP's autobiography serves not only as a platform for airing his grievances but also provides a precious window into his many successes, thunderous performances, indelible friendships, and his enduring love for the beautiful game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved  . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated  . My definition of happiness is \\"the capacity for enjoyment\\".The more we can enjoy what we have,the happier we are.It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends,the freedom to live where we please,and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday.First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunchbox and had the house to myself.Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing,which I love.When the kids and my husband came home,I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother,who raised 14 children,had much of either.She did have a network of close friends and family,and maybe this is what satisfied her. We,however,with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area,have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have.We're so selfconscious about our \\"right\\" to it that it's making us miserable.So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success,without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us-it's about how we see what happens to us.It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative.It's not wishing for what we don't have,but enjoying what we do possess.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Cockfighting is said to be the world's oldest spectator sport and may have originated in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Why has cockfighting has been banned in many cultures during the last century?","output":"Cockfighting has been banned in many cultures during the last century for several reasons, primarily due to concerns about animal welfare, as well as evolving societal values and legal implications. Here are some detailed factors that explain why cockfighting has been banned in various countries: 1. Animal Cruelty: Cockfighting involves putting two roosters in a ring or pit where they fight each other until one is critically injured or killed. The birds often sustain severe injuries, such as punctured lungs, broken bones, and gouged eyes. Animal rights activists and the general public have increasingly recognized this practice as inhumane and cruel, leading to bans on the sport. 2. Societal Values: Over the past century, there has been a shift in societal values and an increasing emphasis on animal welfare and rights. As people become more aware of the suffering and cruelty involved in cockfighting, support for the sport has dwindled, leading governments to enact legislation to protect animals from such activities. 3. Illegal Gambling: Cockfighting often involves illegal gambling, with spectators wagering large sums of money on the outcome of the fights. Governments around the world have enacted laws to curb illegal gambling, and banning cockfighting is an essential part of this effort. By banning the activity, governments can reduce the instances of illegal gambling and the associated social and economic issues. 4. Public Health Concerns: Cockfighting can pose potential health risks to both humans and animals. The transfer of infectious diseases between birds and humans, such as avian influenza, is a significant concern. Moreover, cockfights can facilitate the spread of diseases among the birds themselves, which may lead to an epidemic within the poultry population. 5. Legal Implications: As cockfighting becomes illegal in various jurisdictions, the sport has increasingly been pushed underground. Participants in illegal cockfighting rings may face severe legal consequences if caught, including fines, imprisonment, or even the seizure of their birds. This has deterred many potential cockfighters and led to a decline in the prevalence of the sport. 6. International Pressure: As more countries ban cockfighting, they may exert pressure on neighboring nations to follow suit. This international peer pressure can create a domino effect, leading to widespread bans across a region or even the world. In summary, cockfighting has been banned in many cultures during the last century due to concerns about animal cruelty, evolving societal values that demand greater empathy and care for other living beings, illegal gambling, public health concerns, legal implications, and international pressure. As awareness of animal welfare continues to grow, more countries are likely to implement bans on this cruel and inhumane sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen.  In which region the plates would move, region A or region B? A:","output":"To determine in which region the plates would move and make the area more susceptible to earthquakes, let's analyze the situation step by step: Step 1: Understand the cause of earthquakes Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving and interacting with each other, causing stress along their boundaries. When the stress becomes too great, the energy is released in the form of seismic waves, generating an earthquake. Step 2: Compare the regions Region A has many earthquakes, while Region B has no earthquakes. Step 3: Identify the relationship between plate movement and earthquakes Since earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates, it's reasonable to assume that areas with more earthquakes experience more frequent and/or significant plate movement. Step 4: Draw conclusions Based on the information provided, it's likely that the plates in Region A would move more than in Region B. The higher frequency of earthquakes in Region A suggests that there is greater tectonic activity in this area, leading to increased stress along plate boundaries and ultimately causing earthquakes. In contrast, the lack of earthquakes in Region B suggests that the plates in this region either move very little or that their movement does not generate significant stress to cause earthquakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: It has been lifted on to a huge purpose-built ship which will transport it to England to be scrapped. Shell wants to leave the legs in place. The 24,000 tonne Brent Delta platform topsides sat on a three-legged gravity-based structure in 140 metres of water. The platform lies 115 miles north east of Shetland. It is one of four which is due to be removed from the field in the coming years. Unusually for a platform, the legs of Brent Delta are made of concrete which makes it much more difficult to decommission than one with steel legs. Allseas, the company which operates the decommissioning vessel Pioneering Spirit, said it had set a world lifting record with the removal of the platform. The topsides have now been sea-fastened on board the vessel for transportation to Teesside. Brent Delta was one of the first platforms to be built in the very early days of Britain's oil and gas industry. It sits about 115 miles (185km) north-east of Shetland in a cluster of four platforms which make up the Brent field. Its sister, Brent Bravo, produced its first oil in 1976. At its peak, in 1982, the four platforms were producing more than half a million barrels of oil a day. Being one of the first, it's now at the end of its life and has to be removed. Brent Delta is the first major piece of infrastructure to be decommissioned in the North Sea. More than 100 platforms are forecast to be completely or partially removed over the next decade in the waters of the UK and Norway.","output":"The Brent Delta platform, located 115 miles northeast of Shetland, has been lifted onto a purpose-built ship for transportation to England to be scrapped.

With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" is a 1956 hit single by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \\"Drifting Heart\\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting.

First Sentence: \\"To understand quantum phase transitions, it is useful to contrast them to classical phase transitions (CPT) (also called thermal phase transitions).\\" In this sentence, the main subject is \\"quantum phase transitions,\\" and it suggests contrasting them with \\"classical phase transitions\\" (also called \\"thermal phase transitions\\"). So, it implies that quantum phase transitions are different from classical (or thermal) phase transitions, and understanding their differences can help us comprehend quantum phase transitions better. 2.

Q:A wild baby bison   at Yellowstone National Park had to be killed because of tourists. The tourists thought that the baby bison looked cold. They put it in their car and drove to a park ranger   station. A ranger described the action of the tourists as a \\"dangerous move\\" because adult bisons can look after their babies very well and they will attack   to protect their young. Park rangers took the animal from the car and set it free. But, sadly, the baby was refused by its family because it had the smell from humans. Yellowstone National Park explained on Facebook that the smell from people can cause parent animals to refuse to accept their young. The park tried again and again to make the baby bison lives with its parents. After several times they had to give up. Many people expressed anger at both the tourists and the park. The park said that they did not have the ability to care for a young bison. They also said that it is \\"not the task of the park to save animals\\". The tourists were fined   110 for touching park wildlife. Park rules say that visitors to Yellowstone should stay at least 22 meters away from all wildlife, and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves. One ranger said that Yellowstone recently added many safety signs that say staying near the wildlife there is dangerous to humans and animals as well. Those signs are written in English and other languages. From the passage, we can learn that   _  . A) we must keep away from any wild animal B) we should care about wild animals in a right way C) we'll be fined if we save a bison in the park D) we'd better write safety signs in many languages A:","output":"From the passage, we can learn that we should care about wild animals in the right way. The incident at Yellowstone National Park involving the baby bison highlights the importance of understanding and respecting the natural behavior of wild animals. In this case, the tourists, despite having good intentions, interfered with the baby bison's family dynamics and ultimately caused its rejection and death. It is crucial for people visiting natural parks and wildlife reserves to understand the rules and guidelines set in place for the safety of both humans and animals. In the case of Yellowstone National Park, the rules clearly state that visitors should maintain a safe distance from wildlife (at least 22 meters away from all wildlife and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves). These rules are in place to avoid any potential harm, disruption, or negative consequences for either the wildlife or visitors. Additionally, it is essential that visitors follow the advice of park rangers and other experts who understand the wildlife's behaviors and needs. In the baby bison incident, the park ranger recognized the danger of removing the animal from its natural environment and attempted to re-integrate it into its family to no avail. Park officials also emphasized that it is not the responsibility of the park to save animals. While it may seem counterintuitive, interfering with wild animals in an attempt to help them often does more harm than good. Natural parks and reserves are meant to provide animals with the space and freedom to thrive in their natural habitats, and human interference often upsets the delicate balance of these ecosystems. Moreover, the passage highlights the importance of having safety signs in multiple languages. This ensures that visitors from various backgrounds can understand the rules and potential hazards of interacting with wildlife, ultimately reducing the risk of unintentional harm or interference. In conclusion, the passage teaches us the importance of caring about wild animals in the right way by respecting their natural habitat and behavior, adhering to park rules, and understanding the potential consequences of our actions on these delicate ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How the Tiny Israeli TV Company Keshet Became an International Player The media production and distribution company Keshet International did not even exist four years ago. Since then, its rise has been meteoric. Last year, the company—a subsidiary of Israel-based Keshet Media Group—had six shows on TV in the U.S.—including Dig, Homeland, and Tyrant—and has sold programs in more than 50 territories. Today, it has shows playing on every continent except Antarctica. This foothold is only set to grow with the opening of U.S.-based Keshet Studios, along with a co-production deal with Universal TV and a first look deal at NBC. So, how did a TV production company with a staff of barely 50 people become a worldwide phenomenon within the first few years of existence? Perhaps unsurprisingly, by giving viewers something they hadn’t seen before. Keshet Media Group CEO Avi Nir brought the show Hatufim to the U.S., where it would become Homeland, ushering in an era of increased openness to edgy foreign content. “It all starts with a great idea first,” says Patrick Moran, executive vice president of ABC Studios. According to Moran, despite a barrage of competition from new media producers and broadcasters, the primary concern at studios and networks is still finding unique content, regardless of where it originates. It also helped that Keshet International got started at a time of unprecedented need for programming, thanks to the proliferation of cable channels and new platforms like Netflix and Hulu. According to a study from FX Networks, there were 409 scripted shows on TV in 2015, up from 211 in 2009. Still, with more outlets and shows comes more competition to stand out and attract audiences. Legacy players often accomplish this with big advertising campaigns and the use of well-tested concepts. But for an upstart Israeli studio, throwing money at problems was not an option. “Our way to an audience was by being different,” says Nir. “We are not about cookie cutter shows.” The mere premise of Keshet’s biggest hit, Hatufim, courted controversy in its home market. Any show on kidnapped soldiers and prisoner exchanges is almost guaranteed to stir up strife in Israel, a country with a history of bitter prisoner exchanges, not to mention the 2006 war against Hezbollah that was sparked, in part, by the group’s abduction of Israeli soldiers. The company has also employed its unconventional philosophy in developing talent. “People are very slow to provide financial backing to writers. What Avi and Keshet have done is to really find lot of voices that had not been heard prior and gave them the money and room to grow,” says Bert Salke, president of Fox 21 Television Studios, which produces the Keshet shows Homeland and Tyrant. Keshet International’s growth took off when Nir decided to build on his early forays into the U.S. in order to move Keshet Media Group away from its reliance on the small Israeli market. “They need their formats to travel,” says WME (William Morris Endeavor) head of television Rick Rosen, the agent who represents Keshet. So Nir went to London to sell media executive Alon Shtruzman on the idea of starting a company to develop, shop, produce, and distribute shows around the world. As COO of the streaming service Playcast and formerly vice president of content at the Israeli cable company HOT, Shtruzman understood the technical changes roiling the media industry and had programmed hundreds of hours of television. At HOT, Shtruzman had greenlit In Treatment, a daily show created by Hagai Levi, Keshet’s former head of drama, that was one of the first shows to be “binge watched,” giving Shtruzman experience in non-linear programming before the term “binge watching” existed. Shtruzman jumped at the opportunity. “Israel doesn’t play safe, so I never played it safe. In all my jobs it was always building, disrupting, changing, adjusting to new tech, adjusting to new environments,” Shtruzman says. The process of finding people to build Keshet Studios in the U.S. took Shtruzman two years. One of those he hired—as president of scripted content—was Peter Traugott, who has produced and overseen shows such as The Simpsons, COPS, and Just Shoot Me. “If you look at the head count at Keshet International versus other international companies, it has been a very scrappy, bootstrap company,” says Traugott. Despite being smaller than its competitors, Keshet was one of the first companies to enter both the Chinese and Korean markets with locally produced TV shows. It has also struck co-development and co-production deals with local players across Latin America, the U.K., and Europe. But it is in the U.S. market that Keshet International has had the most impact, becoming an influential part in the expansion of at least one major U.S. television studio in the process. “In the last six years, we went from a studio with one or two shows on the air, and now we are one of the leading cable studios. Keshet has a lot to do with that,” says Fox 21 Television Studios president Bert Salke, who describes Homeland as the most successful show in his studio’s history. Still, not every Keshet show has been a hit. Allegiance, the company’s American adaptation of the Israeli spy drama The Gordin Cell, was cancelled by NBC in 2015 after five poorly rated episodes. And Rising Star, Keshet’s 2014 foray into the talent show genre—a shopworn format at the time—did not go as planned. Keshet jazzed up the concept with new technology from app startup Screenz that allowed audience members to vote on contestants in real time, and the show quickly sold internationally when it was unveiled. But it was cancelled just as quickly due to poor ratings in several key markets, including the U.S. “I think the show was at the point where the whole genre was wearing out,” Nir admits today. Considering Keshet’s missteps and short track record, some in the industry are not convinced that the young company can be more than a small player. “Keshet has a stable of proven writers and producers who have created hits in the past,” one senior level studio executive told Fortune, noting that the company has seen success “on a small scale.” Still, the failures of Rising Star and Allegiance do not seem to have crippled the market for Keshet shows. Today, the company has 20 shows currently in development in the U.S. Shtruzman says that Keshet’s main push in the future will be to gain more control of its content abroad, mainly by continuing to enter into co-production and production deals with deficit financing (as opposed to less risky but less lucrative licensing deals) as well as content distribution. “We develop, produce, distribute; we control the value chain of our shows. I think it’s the only way to build a significant business,” says Shtruzman. For now, though many in the industry say that the current pace of production is unsustainable, there seems to be consensus that the need for content will continue to be strong, even if it is not clear where that content will live or how it will be paid for. “Right now we are in the middle of so much content being produced, and I think we will start to see that constrict a bit,” says Patrick Moran of ABC Studios. “But ultimately I still think good material will trump everything else.” Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Keshet had developed In Treatment and brought it to the U.S. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the rapid rise to success of Keshet International, an Israeli media production and distribution company. Despite only existing for four years, the company has had six successful TV shows in the U.S., and has sold programs in over 50 territories. Due to its success, Keshet Studios will open in the U.S., allowing for co-production deals with Universal TV and a first look deal at NBC. Keshet's success is thought to stem from its ability to provide unique content and develop undiscovered talent, alongside its willingness to take risks and adapt to changes within the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which case would most likely see the substance turning into liquid, case B or case C?  Hint: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--             (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land in Gilpin          County, Colorado, are administered by the Secretary of the          Interior as part of the Royal Gorge Resource Area, Canon City          District, Bureau of Land Management;             (2) these land parcels, which comprises approximately 133          separate tracts of land, and range in size from approximately          38 acres to much less than an acre have been identified as          suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management through          its resource management planning process and are appropriate          for disposal; and             (3) even though the Federal land parcels in Gilpin County,          Colorado, are scattered and small in size, they nevertheless by          virtue of their proximity to existing communities appear to          have a fair market value which may be used by the Federal          Government to exchange for lands which will better lend          themselves to Federal management and have higher values for          future public access, use and enjoyment, recreation, the          protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife and fish and          wildlife habitat, and the protection of riparian lands,          wetland, scenic beauty and other public values.     (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize, direct,  facilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth herein in order to  further the public interest by disposing of Federal lands with limited  public utility and acquire in exchange therefor lands with important  values for permanent public management and protection. SEC. 2. LAND EXCHANGE.     (a) In General.--The exchange directed by this Act shall be  consummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, Lake Gulch,  Inc., a Colorado Corporation (as defined in section 4 of this Act)  offers to transfer to the United States pursuant to the provisions of  this Act the offered lands or interests in land described herein.     (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of section  3 of this Act, Lake Gulch shall convey to the Secretary of the Interior  all right, title, and interest in and to the following offered lands--             (1) certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with          improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and          lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park as          generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Circle C Church Camp'',          dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition by the          United States and without further action by the Secretary of          the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain National Park          and thereafter be administered in accordance with the laws,          rules and regulations generally applicable to the National Park          System and Rocky Mountain National Park;             (2) certain lands located within and adjacent to the United          States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in          Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993          acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Quinlan          Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994; and             (3) certain lands located within the United States Bureau          of Land Management Royal Gorge Resource Area in Huerfano          County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 4,700 acres and          are generally depicted on a map entitled \`\`Bonham Ranch-         Cucharas Canyon'', dated June 1995: Provided, That it is the          intention of Congress that such lands may remain available for          the grazing of livestock as determined appropriate by the          Secretary in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and          regulations: Provided further, That if the Secretary determines          that certain of the lands acquired adjacent to Cucharas Canyon          hereunder are not needed for public purposes they may be sold          in accordance with the provisions of section 203 of the Federal          Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and other applicable          law.     (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise offered  land parcels identified above is unable to be conveyed to the United  States due to appraisal or other problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary  may mutually  agree to substitute therefor alternative offered lands acceptable to  the Secretary.     (d) Conveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of title to  the lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary shall  simultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, and interest of  the United States, subject to valid existing rights, in and to the  following selected lands--             (A) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County,          Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal          Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise          approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all          federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on a          map entitled \`\`Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994;             (B) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County,          Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal          Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54,          which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted on          a map entitled \`\`Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July 1994;          and             (C) certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County,          Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 73 West, Sixth Principal          Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 11 acres,          and are generally depicted as parcels 302-304, 306, and 308-326          on a map entitled \`\`Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July          1994: Provided, however, That a parcel or parcels of land in          section 13 shall not be transferred to Lake Gulch if at the          time of the proposed transfer the parcel or parcels are under          formal application for transfer to a qualified unit of local          government. Due to the small and unsurveyed nature of such          parcels proposed for transfer to Lake Gulch in section 13, and          the high cost of surveying such small parcels, the Secretary is          authorized to transfer such section 13 lands to Lake Gulch          without survey based on such legal or other description as the          Secretary determines appropriate to carry out the basic intent          of the map cited in this subparagraph.     (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the  Secretary determines it is in the public interest, the Secretary may  utilize the authority and direction of this Act to transfer to Lake  Gulch lands in sections 17 and 13 that are in addition to those precise  selected lands shown on the map cited herein, and which are not under  formal application for transfer to a qualified unit of local  government, upon transfer to the Secretary of additional offered lands  acceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to the Secretary by Lake  Gulch of cash equalization money amounting to the full appraised fair  market value of any such additional lands. If any such additional lands  are located in section 13 they may be transferred to Lake Gulch without  survey based on such legal or other description as the Secretary  determines appropriate as long as the Secretary determines that the  boundaries of any adjacent lands not owned by Lake Gulch can be  properly identified so as to avoid possible future boundary conflicts  or disputes. If the Secretary determines surveys are necessary to  convey any such additional lands to Lake Gulch, the costs of such  surveys shall be paid by Lake Gulch but shall not be eligible for any  adjustment in the value of such additional lands pursuant to section  206(f)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (as  amended by the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988) (43  U.S.C. 1716(f)(2)).     (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant to this  Act or other authority of law any lands which are contiguous to North  Clear Creek southeast of the City of Black Hawk, Colorado in the County  of Gilpin, Colorado, the Secretary shall notify and consult with the  County and City and afford such units of local government an  opportunity to acquire or reserve pursuant to the Federal Land Policy  and Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law, such easements or  rights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as may be necessary to  serve public utility line or recreation path needs: Provided, however,  That any survey or other costs associated with the acquisition or  reservation of such easements or rights-of-way shall be paid for by the  unit or units of local government concerned. SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EXCHANGE.     (a) Equalization of Values.--(1) The values of the lands to be  exchanged pursuant to this Act shall be equal as determined by the  Secretary of the Interior utilizing nationally recognized appraisal  standards, including, to the extent appropriate, the Uniform Standards  for Federal Land Acquisition, the Uniform Standards of Professional  Appraisal Practice, the provisions of section 206(d) of the Federal  Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(d)), and other  applicable law.

(3) Any water rights acquired by the United States pursuant to this  section shall be obtained by the Secretary of the Interior in  accordance with all applicable provisions of Colorado law, including  the requirement to change the time, place, and type of use of said  water rights through the appropriate State legal proceedings and to  comply with any terms, conditions, or other provisions contained in an  applicable decree of the Colorado Water Court. The use of any water  rights acquired pursuant to this section shall be limited to water that  can be used or exchanged for water that can be used on the Blanca  Wetlands.

(2) Conveyance of the selected lands to Lake Gulch pursuant to this  Act shall be subject to the existing easement for Gilpin County Road 6.     (3) The above terms and restrictions of this subsection shall not  be considered in determining, or result in any diminution in, the fair  market value of the selected land for purposes of the appraisals of the  selected land required pursuant to section 3 of this Act.

Given the question: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

Question: What is the first name of the person who released three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, \\"Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear\\", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. \\"Dumb All Over\\" is a tirade on religion, as is \\"Heavenly Bank Account\\", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like \\"Society Pages\\" and \\"I'm a Beautiful...

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia?  Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...","output":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia, is Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22).

Translate to English","output":"As a result, you can purchase a release of Debian on compact discs for just a few US dollars. Debian is a popular free operating system using the Linux or FreeBSD kernel. It is renowned for its stability, security, and diverse package availability, thereby enabling a wide range of computer system configurations. As open-source software, Debian is maintained by a community of developers, although some commercial network distributions based on it are sold, bringing this operating system to even more potential users. While most users nowadays download Debian online for free directly from the official Debian website or mirror websites, some users may prefer or require physical media. This can be due to numerous reasons. For example, users might have unreliable internet connections that make downloading large files problematic, may need to install the operating system on several devices without downloading it multiple times, or simply prefer physical copies for their software for safekeeping. For these users, Debian is available for purchase on CDs or DVDs, often at quite a low cost due to Debian's commitment to keeping software free and accessible. These physical releases usually contain the same software and features as the downloadable versions, including the most popular applications and all updates up until the software was burned to the disc. There are numerous online platforms and computer stores where you can get Debian on compact discs for just a few US dollars. For instance, some companies specialize in shipping these discs globally. They offer a variety of options such as different Debian versions, varying sizes, and options for CDs or DVDs.  However, it is critical to ensure that the vendor is trustworthy to avoid fraudulent or malicious copies of the software. A good way to ensure authenticity is to buy from Debian-affiliated vendors or reputable computer stores. Moreover, after receiving the disc, it is recommended to check the disc for authenticity using the provided checksums on the Debian website. By purchasing Debian on a CD, users can take advantage of Debian's robust capabilities for a mere few dollars, making this a cost-effective choice for those who prefer or require physical software copies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)  the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland.  - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland.  - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington.  - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland. At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth.  - Framwellgate Bridge is a mediaeval masonry arch bridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England . It is a Grade I listed building .  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - The City of Sunderland is a local government district of Tyne and Wear, in North East England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, and a range of suburban villages.    What is the relationship between 'framwellgate bridge' and 'county durham'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between Framwellgate Bridge and County Durham is that Framwellgate Bridge is a medieval masonry arch bridge located in Durham, which is a city and the county town of County Durham in North East England.

This led to the discovery that the Earths crust was broken up into regions, or plates. Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries. This was evidence that continents can move. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Scientists know he plates are in motion. They now know the direction and speed of this motion . Plates dont move very fast. They move only a few centimeters a year. This is about the same rate fingernails grow. So you might wonder, what could cause this motion? What supplies the energy to cause this change?

Tanya looked thinner than Megan because","output":"Tanya looked thinner than Megan because she had recently adopted a series of significant lifestyle changes, which have resulted in a notable transformation in her physical appearance, overall health, and self-confidence. Some of the factors contributing to Tanya's slimmed-down look in comparison to Megan include diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep quality. Firstly, Tanya has been focusing on improving her diet, with an emphasis on consuming nutrient-dense, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. She has been mindful of portion sizes, ensuring that her caloric intake is appropriate for her height, weight, and activity level. Additionally, Tanya has limited her intake of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods such as processed snacks, sugary beverages, and fast food. This conscious shift in dietary habits has allowed Tanya to lose excess body fat, making her appear thinner than Megan who may not be adhering to a similar nutrition plan. Secondly, Tanya has incorporated regular exercise into her routine, participating in a combination of cardiovascular training, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Her cardio workouts, which include activities like running, swimming, or cycling, have not only helped her shed unwanted pounds but also improved her overall cardiovascular health. Meanwhile, her strength training routines have contributed to the development of lean muscle mass, which can further enhance her slim appearance. The added flexibility exercises, such as yoga or Pilates, have helped Tanya maintain proper posture and reduce muscle imbalances, both of which contribute to a leaner figure. Thirdly, Tanya has been working on managing stress levels by practicing mindful techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or engaging in activities that bring her joy and relaxation. High-stress levels can cause the body to produce excess cortisol, which can lead to weight gain, particularly in the abdominal area. By keeping her stress levels in check, Tanya has minimized this risk and maintained a more slender silhouette than Megan, who may be experiencing higher levels of stress. Lastly, Tanya has prioritized improving her sleep quality by establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine, and ensuring her sleep environment is conducive to restful slumber. Adequate sleep is crucial for weight management and overall health as it allows the body to properly recover and rejuvenate, maintaining an optimal hormonal balance that can prevent weight gain. Megan may not be receiving enough quality sleep or may have sleep disturbances that are contributing to her weight status, making her appear less thin in comparison to Tanya. In summary, Tanya looked thinner than Megan because she has been dedicated to creating a healthier lifestyle by making smart dietary choices, engaging in regular exercise, managing stress effectively, and prioritizing sleep. These positive habits have allowed her to shed excess weight, build lean muscle mass, and maintain a more slender appearance than her friend Megan, who may not be making the same conscious efforts to promote her own well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Sridevi Kapoor (born Shree Amma Yanger Ayyapan; 13 August 1963 - 24 February 2018) was an Indian actress and film producer who starred in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, and Kannada films. Regarded as Indian cinema's biggest female superstar, she was the recipient of a National Film Award, two Filmfare Awards and three Filmfare Awards South.

Context: On 20 February 2018, Sridevi and her youngest daughter Khushi had flown to Al Jazirah Al Hamra in Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, to attend the wedding of her nephew Mohit Marwah. She decided to spend a couple of days in Dubai to shop for eldest daughter Janhvi Kapoor's 21st birthday, after the wedding. Her husband Boney Kapoor was not present with them on the wedding day as he had to attend a meeting in Lucknow on 22 February. However he had already planned a surprise visit to his wife, with whom he spoke on the morning of 24 February, where she told him that \\"Papa (that's how Sridevi addressed Boney), I'm missing you.\\" According to Kapoor, he took a 15:30 flight to Dubai and reached Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel around 18:20 (Dubai time) in room 2201 where the actress was staying. She and Kapoor briefly met and chatted for half an-hour or so. Afterwards they decided to have dinner. Sridevi went to bathe and get dressed for dinner, while Kapoor waited in a living room. After 15-20 minutes, around 19:00, he called out the actress as they were getting late but was unable to get a response. Kapoor went to knock the bathroom door, which had not been locked from inside and sensed that something was wrong. He opened the door and found the actress completely immersed and unresponsive in the bathtub. It remains unclear whether Sridevi fell unconscious after or before the drowning.  Sridevi was pronounced dead on 24 February 2018 at 19:00 GMT at her hotel room where her husband had found her.

The toxicology report later also revealed that traces of alcohol were found in her body, and water was found in her lungs.  After rumors that news of her death was an Internet hoax, her brother-in-law, Sanjay Kapoor, confirmed that it was true. Her fans, co-stars and other Bollywood stars posted condolences on Twitter to mourn the death. After few days of police investigation, on 27 February, Sridevi's case was closed, and her body was flown back to Mumbai, India by her husband and her stepson, Arjun Kapoor, on a private jet belonging to Anil Ambani.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - The Province of the Cape of Good Hope, commonly referred to as the Cape Province, was a province in the Union of South Africa and subsequently the Republic of South Africa. It encompassed the old Cape Colony, and had Cape Town as its capital. Following the end of the Apartheid era, the Cape Province was split up to form the new Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Western Cape provinces.  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Ciskei (or ) was a nominally independent state  a Bantustan  in the south east of South Africa. It covered an area of , almost entirely surrounded by what was then the Cape Province, and possessed a small coastline along the shore of the Indian Ocean.  - Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections. Apartheid was also enforced in South West Africa until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990.  - The Eastern Cape is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Bhisho, but its two largest cities are Port Elizabeth and East London.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Anthony Howell acted as an emergency goalkeeper as Alfreton Town's two goalkeepers were out injured. Nicky Law's side were thrashed 5-1 in their replay against Lincoln City. Alfreton's request to sign a goalkeeper was turned down by the FA. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Alfreton Town's Emergency Goalkeeper Anthony Howell in 5-1 Loss Against Lincoln City Step 1: Begin with a brief introduction, focusing on the unusual situation of Anthony Howell acting as an emergency goalkeeper due to Alfreton Town's regular goalkeepers being injured. ---  In a twist of fate for Alfreton Town Football Club, Anthony Howell, a midfielder, was forced to act as an emergency goalkeeper during their recent replay match against Lincoln City. With the team's two primary goalkeepers sidelined due to injuries, Howell stepped in to fill the crucial spot. Step 2: Explain and analyze the match outcome. --- The situation proved to be challenging for the non-league side, as they suffered a crushing 5-1 defeat at the hands of their opponents, Lincoln City, in the replay. The lack of experience in the goalkeeper position was evident throughout the game, with Howell's unfamiliarity and skillset imbalance contributing to Alfreton Town's heavy loss. Step 3: Detail the club's request to the FA and provide context. --- Prior to the match, Alfreton Town had approached the Football Association (FA) with a request to sign a specialist goalkeeper to fill in the void caused by the injuries sustained by their two regular keepers. Unfortunately for the team, their request was denied by the FA, leaving them with little choice but to put Howell in goal. Step 4: Highlight Alfreton Town manager Nicky Law's strategy for dealing with the situation. --- Despite the adverse conditions, Alfreton Town manager Nicky Law attempted to make the best of the situation by placing his trust in Howell to defend the goal. The team's strategy revolved around minimizing the impact of their goalkeeping weakness, while focusing on maintaining a strong offense to counterbalance the deficit. Step 5: End with a summary and potential implications for both the club and the FA process. --- In conclusion, Anthony Howell's emergency role as goalkeeper led to a difficult outcome for Alfreton Town, with the team falling to a 5-1 defeat against Lincoln City. The match has raised questions about the FA's decision to reject their request for a goalkeeper signing and the need for more flexible regulations in such situations. Additionally, this challenging experience is likely to serve as a learning opportunity for both the team as they prepare for future matches and the FA as they refine their processes to better accommodate the unexpected hurdles faced by football clubs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this choice: Step 1: Understanding the question The question is asking what you are covered with when you are taking a bath. This means we are looking for a condition or substance that typically covers a person during a bath. Step 2: Eliminating irrelevant or incorrect options a. Cleanness - This refers to a state of being clean, which may be achieved after taking a bath, but it's not something that physically covers you while you're bathing. b. Exfoliation - This is a process that can be performed during a bath (e.g., using a scrub or body brush), but it is not something that inherently covers you as you bathe. c. Use water - While it is true that water is a necessary component of taking a bath, the option \\"use water\\" does not describe something that covers you during a bath. d. Wetness - This is a direct result of being in contact with water, so it is a plausible option. e. Rash - This refers to a skin reaction, which wouldn't typically occur during a bath, unless one is dealing with an allergic reaction to a product used during bathing. However, it is not inherent to the bathing process. Step 3: Selecting the correct option Based on the elimination of other options and the determination that \\"wetness\\" is directly related to being in contact with water during a bath, I can confidently conclude that the correct choice is \\"wetness\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\".

If you love bacon, this will make you jump for joy: Rachel Begun, RD, a food and nutrition consultant in Boulder, Colo. eats bacon. “It’s got such a salty, smoky flavor that you can use small amounts to jazz up veggies—in fact, a little bacon can make you love veggies more,” she says. The key here? Small amounts. Bacon can be loaded with salt and saturated fat, which is why you want to use it more like a garnish than a main event. Sprinkle crumbled bacon atop a side dish of Brussels sprouts or a veggie-filled salad.

Sass suggests picking up organic eggs (the chickens are fed a healthier, all-vegetarian diet without hormones or antibiotics).

If you go for whole-milk yogurt, watch your portions—a cup of full-fat plain yogurt is 160 calories, while a cup of fat-free is 110 calories. Whole milk also contains more saturated fat—5 grams per cup, or about a quarter of what the American Heart Association recommends in a day. People tend to fear potatoes because of their reputation as a waist-widening starch. But Sass sees them in a different light. They provide important nutrients like energy-supplying B vitamins and iron, plus vitamin C, calcium, potassium, and fiber, and they are also a source of a fat-burning carb called resistant starch, she says. “Like fiber, resistant starch fills you up but it doesn’t get digested and absorbed, and studies show it triggers your body to burn more fat,” she says. Sass chows down on potatoes (her favorites are red, blue, and fingerling) once a week. Activate that slimming resistant starch by eating them in a cold potato salad. Roast, then chill taters and toss with a mixture of Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and garlic. Health.com: How to Lose Winter Weight This Spring If you’ve ever eaten at an Indian restaurant, you’ve had ghee, which is clarified butter. The good news: ghee tastes so intense that you need just a few drops to adds loads of flavor to any food. “It makes veggies more interesting,” says Rachel Beller, RD, author of Eat to Lose, Eat to Win. Plus, one teaspoon has only 45 calories (a teaspoon of olive oil, for comparison, contains 40). Beller combines a teaspoon of olive oil with a half-teaspoon of ghee and uses it to toss roasted or steamed veggies. You’ll find ghee in the ethnic food section in grocery stores. “You can take foods that are meant to be enjoyed and make them nutritious,” says Clerkin, who eats fresh pasta a couple times a week. (Find fresh pasta in the refrigerated section at grocery stores, or at a farmer’s market.) Balance out pasta with lean protein (like fish or chicken), healthy fats (like olive oil), and plenty of fiber-rich veggies, advises Clerkin. As a rule, Clerkin matches the quantity of pasta she eats with an equal amount of vegetables. Beller, another pasta lover, orders it with marinara sauce as a side to fish at a favorite Italian restaurant. “Ask for it to be cooked al dente,” she advises. “The firmer pasta will help keep your blood sugar more stable.” They’re made from potatoes, but no one considers fries a vegetable. Still, Begun indulges in fries occasionally. Notice the word indulge? “These aren’t a health food by any means, but can still be enjoyed in moderation and with the right accompaniments,” she says. First rule: enjoy fries as a side to something lean and nutritious, like a salad with chicken or a bowl of steamed mussels. Second, watch portions, since restaurants serve up fries practically by the bucketful. Begun recommends eating half or sharing with a friend, and going light on the dipping sauce (especially if it’s mayo-based). Finally, to get every single bit of salty enjoyment out of them, order fries where you know they’re freshly prepared in-house. Unlike many dried fruits, raisins aren’t sugar bombs. Why? They’re just dried grapes. Though most dried fruits contain added sugar or fruit juice, raisins usually do not. You need to mind portions, however. One raisin contains the same number of calories as one grape, but a raisin is much smaller. A cup of grapes shrinks down to a quarter-cup of raisins, making it easy to go overboard. Health.com: 16 Ways to Lose Weight Fast “It’s healthier than whole wheat,” says Beller. Shocking, we know, but here’s why: sourdough is unique because it’s made with a lactic acid starter that undergoes fermentation, which alters the bread’s starches. “This helps prevent your blood sugar from spiking better than white or wheat bread,” she says. On a recent dinner out, a basket of homemade sourdough bread arrived at Beller’s table. She didn’t go to town on it (it’s still bread, after all), but she took a half of a slice and enjoyed each bite. Yep, you’ve heard that chocolate is good for you, but many people still don’t believe it, says Beller. “It’s a health food that nutritionists prescribe,” she says. It’s brimming with disease-fighting polyphenols. You can find those same good-for-you nutrients in a cup of hot cocoa. Skip the pre-made hot cocoa packets, as these are packed with sugar. Beller makes hers with pure cocoa powder, a teaspoon of dark raw honey or pure maple syrup, and unsweetened almond or coconut milk. Doughnuts, cakes, and cookies will never be good for you, but the occasional sweet treat won’t wreck your diet and, perhaps more importantly, will prevent you from ever feeling deprived. “You can eat anything as long as you balance it out,” says Clerkin. “I eat a really great doughnut two or three times a year.

Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 6 interconference duel with the Minnesota Vikings.  Baltimore would trail in the first quarter as Vikings quarterback Brett Favre completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian.  Afterwards, the Ravens would snag the only points of the second quarter with kicker Steven Hauschka making a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Minnesota would extend its lead as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 40-yard field goal. Baltimore would come right back into the game with running back Ray Rice's 22-yard touchdown run, but Longwell helped out the Vikings with a 22-yard field goal.  In a nerve-racking fourth quarter, Minnesota increased its lead with Favre finding Shiancoe again on a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Ravens would respond with quarterback Joe Flacco's 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Clayton.  After Longwell gave the Vikings a 29-yard field goal, Baltimore would take the lead as Flacco completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason and Rice getting a 33-yard touchdown run.

I read this background article the other day: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12]  I am facing a new situation today: The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which  had shallow water was a surfer's heaven.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing? Answer:","output":"The Coral beach is less suitable for surfing and windsurfing. Step 1: Identify the factors affecting surfing and windsurfing conditions From the background article, we learned that wave heights, wavelengths, and wave-breaking motions are factors that affect surfing conditions. These factors change when ocean waves approach the shore, depending on the water depth and steepness of the shore. Step 2: Compare the conditions at the two beaches Coral beach has nice sand and deeper water, whereas Surfer beach has shallow water. According to the background article, wave heights tend to increase and wavelengths tend to shorten as ocean waves move from deep water to shallow water. This change in wave characteristics results in steeper wave crests and broader, shallower troughs, making the waves more suitable for surfing when they break at the shore. Step 3: Determine which beach is less suitable for surfing and windsurfing Since Coral beach has deeper water, it is less likely to have the increased wave heights and shorter wavelengths necessary for good surfing conditions described in the background article. On the other hand, Surfer beach's shallow water provides these ideal surfing and windsurfing conditions. Conclusion: Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article and the comparison of the two beaches, Coral beach is less suitable for surfing and windsurfing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: During the apartheid era, those classed as \\"Coloured\\" were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as \\"Black\\". The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites, creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks. Where were the \\"black\\" areas?","output":"During the apartheid era in South Africa, the black areas were typically large townships located on the periphery of major cities and towns. These areas were purposefully created by the South African government as part of their policy of racial segregation, which aimed at segregating the black majority population from the white minority. These townships were often situated in locations that were geographically isolated, had poor infrastructure, and limited access to facilities and resources. Some of the most notable black townships during the apartheid era include Soweto, Khayelitsha, Gugulethu, and Alexandra. Soweto, an abbreviation for South Western Township, is a large township located to the southwest of Johannesburg. Established in the early 20th century, Soweto steadily expanded in the following decades as the apartheid government forcibly relocated black South Africans to this area. Today, it is the largest township in South Africa and has an important historical significance. It was the site of the 1976 Soweto Uprising when thousands of black students protested against the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction in black schools. Khayelitsha, meaning \\"new home\\" in Xhosa, is another significant black township dating back to the apartheid era. It is located on the Cape Flats, a sprawling, sandy plain just outside of Cape Town. Khayelitsha was founded in the 1980s as a result of the apartheid government's efforts to forcibly move black South Africans living in informal settlements in the Cape Town metropolitan region to designated townships. Today, it is one of the fastest-growing townships in South Africa and remains a largely disadvantaged area with high levels of poverty and unemployment. Gugulethu, meaning \\"our pride\\" in Xhosa, was yet another apartheid-era black township, also situated on the Cape Flats, outside of Cape Town. Established in the 1960s, Gugulethu was one of the first racially segregated townships created to accommodate black South Africans who had been forcibly relocated from Cape Town's city center and its surrounding areas. Over the years, Gugulethu faced numerous challenges such as overcrowding, lack of infrastructure, and high crime rates. Alexandra, commonly known as \\"Alex,\\" is another notable township established during the apartheid era for black residents. Located in Johannesburg, Alexandra was originally established in the early 20th century as a freehold suburb for black South Africans. However, as the apartheid government sought to enforce their segregation policies, Alexandra was incorporated into the broader system of townships for black South Africans. Much like other black townships during apartheid, Alexandra experienced overcrowding, limited social and economic opportunities, as well as substandard living conditions. In summary, black areas during apartheid were mainly large townships located on the outskirts of major cities in South Africa. These areas were deliberately designed and developed to segregate the majority black population from the white minority and were characterized by poor living conditions and limited access to resources and opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Jurisprudence is the science, study, and theory of law. It includes principles behind law that make the law. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups:  - Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity. Some cultures have specific gender roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra (chhaka) of India and Pakistan.  - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law.  - JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger. It features continuously updated US and international legal news and expert commentary. JURIST is dedicated to advancing civic education, supporting sound decision-making and promoting the rule of law by objectively reporting, documenting and analyzing important legal developments as they happen. JURIST seeks to encourage teaching, learning, and scholarship within the legal community and in the general community.  - In jurisprudence, procedural defenses are a form of defense, via which a party argues that it should not be held liable for a legal charge or claim brought against it. In common law jurisdictions the term has applications in both criminal law and civil law. Procedural defenses are applicable independently of the question of guilt or innocence in a criminal proceeding, and independently of substantive findings for or against a plaintiff or defendant in a civil proceeding.  - Reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, applying logic, establishing and verifying facts, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information. It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art and is normally considered to be a definitive characteristic of human nature. Reason, or an aspect of it, is sometimes referred to as rationality.   - A defendant is a person or entity accused of a crime in criminal prosecution or a person or entity against whom some type of civil relief is being sought in a civil case.  - In jurisprudence , prosecutorial misconduct is \`\` an illegal act or failing to act , on the part of a prosecutor , especially an attempt to sway the jury to wrongly convict a defendant or to impose a harsher than appropriate punishment . '' It is similar to selective prosecution .  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - A theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking. Depending on the context, the results might for example include generalized explanations of how nature works. The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several different related meanings.   - Criminal justice is the system of practices and institutions of governments directed at upholding social control, deterring and mitigating crime, or sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties and rehabilitation efforts. Those accused of crime have some protections against abuse of investigatory and prosecution powers.  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - In jurisprudence, selective prosecution is a procedural defense in which a defendant argues that he should not be held criminally liable for breaking the law, as the criminal justice system discriminated against him by choosing to prosecute. In a claim of selective prosecution, a defendant essentially argues that it is irrelevant whether he is guilty of violating a law, but that the fact of being prosecuted is based upon forbidden reasons. Such a claim might, for example, entail an argument that persons of different age, race, religion, or gender, were engaged in the same illegal actions for which the defendant is being tried and were not prosecuted, and that the defendant is \\"only\\" being prosecuted because of a bias. In the US, this defense is based upon the 14th Amendment, which stipulates, \\"nor shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\"  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - Natural law (\\"lex naturalis\\") is a philosophy that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature and can be understood universally through human reason. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, as determined by nature, is universal.

Given the question: Given the following passage  \\"An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

It is not a continuation of the narrative from To Kill a Mockingbird.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How are LP's protected\\" is in \\"Vinyl records can be warped by heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design. \\"wow\\" (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"LPs, or long-playing records, are protected through a combination of careful handling, proper storage, and effective packaging. These methods are crucial in preserving the quality and extending the longevity of vinyl records. Understanding the various factors that can damage LPs is the first step towards their effective protection. As stated in your provided text, LPs are vulnerable to warping caused by heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, and manufacturing defects like excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover. Therefore, to protect LPs, they should be kept away from sources of heat and direct sunlight, and should be stored properly aligned vertically, providing necessary stability and preventing warpage caused by improper storage.  Moreover, removing any tight plastic shrinkwrap can prevent the LPs from overly compressing and warping over time. The issue of \\"wow,\\" or once-per-revolution pitch variation, can be caused by a warped record or a spindle hole not precisely centered. There's not much one can do about a spindle hole not being in the precise center, as it is often a manufacturing defect. However, taking measures to prevent the LP from warping can directly help in reducing this pitch variation. A standard and effective practice for the protection of LPs is using covers. An LP is typically placed within a paper or plastic inner cover, which protects the delicate grooved surface from dust and scratches. The inner cover safeguards the vinyl record itself, while an outer cardboard cover provides an additional layer of protection. An ideal method is to place the LP in the paper or plastic inner cover in such a way that the opening is entirely within the outer cardboard cover. This approach helps to substantially reduce the ingress of dust onto the record surface. For singles, it is noted that they usually have simple paper covers without an inner cover. This lack of an inner cover might make singles more prone to dust accumulation, thus using plastic or paper sleeves for singles can be beneficial. In sum, protecting LPs involves careful handling to avoid scratches, appropriate storage to prevent warping, usage of inner and outer covers to reduce dust accumulation, and consideration of the manufacturing attributes like the precise centering of the spindle hole. Taking these protective measures can help ensure your vinyl records remain in good condition and provide a quality sound for many years to come."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who expresses no interest in their owner?, using the article: Chance (voiced by Michael J.

Read this and answer the question On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a new comment system that requires all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos and making the comment system Google+ oriented. The changes are in large part an attempt to address the frequent criticisms of the quality and tone of YouTube comments. They give creators more power to moderate and block comments, and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better, more relevant discussions appear at the top.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What would happen if a salesman didn't do his job right? Possible A: promotion, service account, sell products, get fired, work potential customer  Why is \\"get fired\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Get fired\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the consequences that could arise due to a salesman failing to perform their job duties appropriately. In the given question, we are asked what would happen if a salesman didn't do his job right. Human common sense implies that underperforming or failing to meet job expectations can lead to negative outcomes for the individual involved. In any profession, it is reasonable to assume that an employee is expected to carry out their responsibilities effectively and meet certain performance standards set by their employer. In the case of a salesman, their primary job is to promote and sell products or services, secure and maintain customer accounts, and develop strong relationships with potential customers. When a salesman is unable to fulfill these responsibilities or consistently underperforms, their job security could be at risk. Understanding why \\"get fired\\" is consistent with human common sense requires an appreciation of the cause-and-effect relationship between performance and job security. This relationship can be explained through the following reasons: 1. Accountability: Employers typically hold employees accountable for their performance and require them to meet certain standards. If a salesman is not doing their job right, they are failing to meet these expectations and could face disciplinary action, including termination. 2. Impact on the business: A salesman's inability to perform their job properly can have adverse effects on the business as a whole, leading to lost revenue, unsatisfied clients, and damaged reputation. This can put pressure on the employer to optimize their workforce and replace underperforming employees with more capable ones to protect and improve the business. 3. Employee evaluation and performance reviews: Many organizations conduct periodic employee evaluations and performance reviews. If a salesman consistently exhibits poor performance during these evaluations, it becomes more evident to the employer that the employee may not be the best fit for the job, increasing the likelihood of termination. 4. Competition in the job market: In a competitive job market, employers can often find qualified candidates who are eager to demonstrate their abilities and contribute positively to the business. In such a scenario, an underperforming salesman would be more easily replaceable, and the employer might opt to terminate their employment to make room for someone they perceive as more competent. 5. Legal implications: Depending on the jurisdiction and the terms of the employment contract, consistent underperformance might constitute a valid reason for termination without undue legal implications for the employer. Employers are generally cautious about wrongful dismissal, but terminating the employment of a salesman who is not doing their job right may be justified within the legal framework. In conclusion, human common sense recognizes that a cause-and-effect relationship exists between a salesman's job performance and their job security. Consequently, it perceives \\"get fired\\" as a plausible outcome for a salesman who is not doing their job right, given the potential negative impact on both the business and the individual's career prospects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The role has been most notably portrayed by actors Sean Kanan from 1993 to 1997, and Billy Warlock from 1997 to 2003, with a brief return in 2005. Kanan made his on-screen return as A.J. on October 26, 2012, after a 15-year absence. The newborn A.J. was portrayed by child actor Eric Kroh from 1979 to 1983. Abraham Geary briefly stepped into the role in 1983. The role was also portrayed by Jason Marsden (1986-1988), Christopher Nelson (1988), Justin Whalin (April 1988 - 1989). On June 20, 1991, Gerald Hopkins stepped in the role of A.J. on contract and last appeared on December 30, 1992.

Following Kanan's departure, actor Billy Warlock was hired for the role of A.J., and he made his debut on June 13, 1997. In 2003, Warlock earned a pre-nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of A.J.. Warlock departed from the series in December 2003, amongst rumors that he was fired after disputes with show executives; the network replied his exit was due to lack of storyline.  In early 2005, the network's announcement of Warlock's return as A.J. was briefly put on hold, speculated as contract disputes. Warlock's return first aired on February 4, 2005, and shortly thereafter Warlock announced his return to the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives as Frankie Brady. Warlock's exit lead to rumors of Kanan's possible reprisal of the role, who had recently announced move to recurring status in his role as Deacon Sharpe in the CBS Daytime soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. Warlock exited the series in April 2005 and the character was killed off.  On September 17, 2012, Kanan revealed in an interview with TV Guide's Michael Logan that he was put on contract with General Hospital, but his character was not being announced. Rumors arose that Kanan might replace Steve Burton in the role of A.J.'s brother, Jason Morgan; the resemblance between the two fed into the rumors. Kanan first appeared on October 26, revealed to be A.J., retconing the character's death. On March 17, 2014, it was announced that Kanan would once again be leaving the role of A.J.

It was more natural for Christopher to go hunting than Joseph because","output":"Christopher had been an avid outdoorsman since childhood, while Joseph had always preferred more indoor activities. From a young age, Christopher's father had introduced him to hunting, teaching him not only the essentials of tracking and surviving, but also the art of becoming one with nature. Joseph, on the other hand, had grown up in more urban surroundings and had developed interests in technology, arts, and intellectual pursuits. Step 1: Analyze the given text and add more information about the differences between Christopher and Joseph. Reasoning: Expanding upon the characters' backgrounds and interests helps to give a clear picture of why one is more inclined to go hunting than the other. Over the years, Christopher's experience in hunting translated into an impressive skill set, making him adept at identifying and stalking game, as well as handling different firearms with precision and care. In contrast, Joseph's limited exposure to the wild left him somewhat ill-equipped to face its challenges. Although he had tried hunting once or twice out of curiosity, he always felt out of his element and had trouble keeping up. Step 2: Describe each character's level of experience in hunting and the skills they have developed related to it. Reasoning: This further solidifies the difference between the two men, making it clear that Christopher has more expertise in hunting than Joseph. Moreover, Christopher had a deep appreciation for the wilderness and the wildlife that inhabited it. He held a certain reverence for the sport of hunting, understanding its importance in maintaining the balance of nature and the necessity of ethical practices. On the other hand, Joseph found it difficult to accept the idea of killing animals for sport and held a deep-rooted concern for the environment and animal welfare. Step 3: Compare Christopher's and Joseph's views on hunting and the environment. Reasoning: This reveals the difference in their motivations and values, showing why Christopher is more inclined to go hunting. Given the stark contrast in skill level, experience, and values between Christopher and Joseph, it was only natural for Christopher to be more inclined to go hunting. For him, it was an opportunity to reconnect with nature, while practicing an activity both ingrained in his culture and imparted to him by his father. On the other hand, Joseph found solace in exploring pursuits that better aligned with his intellectual and urban inclinations, engaging in activities that did not involve hunting. Step 4: Conclude why it was more natural for Christopher to go hunting than Joseph. Reasoning: This ties together the differences in their experience, skill set, and values, offering clear reasons why Christopher is better suited for hunting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the left side, there's only one term with t, so it stays as -46*t. On the right side, there are two terms with t: 27*t and 6*t. Combine these: 27*t + 6*t = 33*t. The simplified equation is thus: -46*t + 1554 = 33*t + 2423 Step 2: Move all terms with t to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To do this, add 46*t to both sides to move the term with t to the right side of the equation: -46*t + 46*t + 1554 = 33*t + 46*t + 2423 This simplifies to: 1554 = 79*t + 2423 Next, subtract 2423 from both sides to move the constant term to the left side of the equation: 1554 - 2423 = 79*t + 2423 - 2423 This simplifies to: -869 = 79*t Step 3: Solve for t by dividing both sides by 79: -869 / 79 = 79*t / 79 This simplifies to: t = -11 The solution is t = -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Tweezing, or pulling the hair out with tweezers, is a cheap and effective way to remove hair from any area on the face. The major downsides are only that it is time-consuming and somewhat painful, especially in sensitive areas. An Epilator is a device, usually priced between 30-100, which works by pulling out multiple hairs at once. While effective, fast, and relatively inexpensive, it can be painful the first few times it’s used. Like with waxing, however, the pain lessens over time as you become used to the sensation. Often referred to as “bleaching”, this is the practice of dyeing the hair to be the same or a similar color to the skin tone. This makes it less noticeable.  What color you choose will be based on your skin tone and special kits can often be purchased for the face. This is any one of a number of creams, lotions, and similar products which use a chemical process to \\"melt\\" the hair.  These are cheap, easy to use, and generally pain-free. However, they can cause chemical burns if used incorrectly and the effects generally last only a week. Waxing is one of the more common ways to remove facial hair. The cost of the procedure will depend upon what part of your face you have waxed, but it is generally not too expensive. The effects will usually last a few weeks but the procedure is painful. It can also result in ingrown hairs. . The pain of waxing and the expense of an epilator not for you? Threading is an easy way to remove hair from your brows, lip, or face in general. This method is simple to learn, easy to do, relatively painless, and doesn't require any tools. All you need is some string! You can also go in to a salon for professional threading, but only if you really want to. If you are worried about your eyebrows more than other facial hair, consider trimming the hair rather than removing it. Trimming the eyebrows can make them appear less thick and dark and is easy and cheap to do yourself at home. You can, of course, also shave any facial hair which bothers you. While it is not true that shaving will make hair grow back thicker or darker, shaving will often cause shaving bumps and is most likely to cause ingrown hairs so use shaving sparingly or with appropriate precautions.","output":"The article discusses several methods for facial hair removal, including tweezing, epilating, bleaching, using depilatory creams, waxing, threading, trimming, and shaving. Tweezing is an inexpensive method for hair removal, but it can be time-consuming and painful, especially in sensitive areas. Epilators are devices priced between 30-100 that quickly remove multiple hairs, but may initially cause some pain. Bleaching involves dyeing the hair to match the skin tone, making it less noticeable. Although this method relies on choosing the right color, there are special kits available for face use. Depilatory creams employ a chemical process to dissolve hair, providing an easy, pain-free, and cost-effective solution. However, improper use can result in chemical burns, and the effects typically last for only a week. Waxing is a common, reasonably-priced facial hair removal technique that retains its effect for a few weeks. Nevertheless, it can be painful and cause ingrown hairs. Threading is a simple and relatively painless hair removal technique that only requires a piece of string, although professional salon services are also available.  For eyebrows specifically, trimming can be a more manageable solution, as it enables the control of thickness and darkness. Lastly, shaving can be used to remove any bothersome facial hair. Despite popular belief, shaving does not cause hair to grow back thicker or darker. However, it does often result in shaving bumps and a higher chance of ingrown hairs, so precautions are recommended."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In English, it translates to: \\"Prime Minister Sali Berisha described corruption as 'a cancer, a national issue that needs to be addressed.'\\"   This sentence is reporting the Turkish Prime Minister, Sali Berisha's stance on the topic of corruption. The metaphor used by the Prime Minister, \\"a cancer\\", indicates his view of corruption as a harmful and potentially destructive issue, comparing its effects to the deadly disease. Furthermore, calling it a \\"national issue\\" stresses its impact on a wider scale across the whole nation rather than just at an individual or limited regional level. The phrase, \\"that needs to be addressed,\\" makes clear his affirmation that the issue needs to be tackled or resolved. It implies an urgency and priority, perhaps signaling a commitment to take anti-corruption measures or encouraging relevant actions to combat the problem. The sentence doesn't provide specifics about which kinds of corruption or which sectors are most affected, or how Sali Berisha plans to address the issue. The use of such strong language, however, communicates a high level of seriousness and concern.

The killer sends his victims a Black Ace card, warning them they are to die and then kills them, his way of taunting the police. Neil Broderick, an author, intends writing a book about him and is on his way to see Thornton Drake to get more information about him. Austin Winters is his secretary and Neil met his daughter Martha on the train, on the way to Chicago. Drake has just received a Black Ace, with the words: \\"At seven tomorrow night\\", the time he is to be killed. Two plainclothes cops arrive from police headquarters, having had a call, Clancy and Dugan (both incompetents). Martha suggests that they leave for Drake's Louisiana plantation tomorrow morning and be far away from there at seven tomorrow night. Drake agrees and suggests they all go.

Q: In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article. Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Abstract: Neural stem cells are precursors of neurons and glial cells. During brain development, these cells proliferate, migrate and differentiate into specific lineages. Recently neural stem cells within the adult central nervous system were identified. Informations are now emerging about regulation of stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation by numerous soluble factors such as chemokines and cytokines. However, the signal transduction mechanisms downstream of these factors are less clear. Here, we review potential evidences for a novel central role of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in these crucial signal transduction processes. NF-kappaB is an inducible transcription factor detected in neurons, glia and neural stem cells. NF-kappaB was discovered by David Baltimore's laboratory as a transcription factor in lymphocytes. NF-kappaB is involved in many biological processes such as inflammation and innate immunity, development, apoptosis and anti-apoptosis. It has been recently shown that members of the NF-kappaB family are widely expressed by neurons, glia and neural stem cells. In the nervous system, NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in neuronal plasticity, learning, memory consolidation, neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. Recent data suggest an important role of NF-kappaB on proliferation, migration and differentiation of neural stem cells. NF-kappaB is composed of three subunits: two DNA-binding and one inhibitory subunit. Activation of NF-kappaB takes place in the cytoplasm and results in degradation of the inhibitory subunit, thus enabling the nuclear import of the DNA-binding subunits. Within the nucleus, several target genes could be activated. In this review, we suggest a model explaining the multiple action of NF-kappaB on neural stem cells. Furthermore, we discuss the potential role of NF-kappaB within the so-called brain cancer stem cells.. Title: Potential role of NF-kappaB in adult neural stem cells: the underrated steersman?

I just finished reading Hornet's Nest. It was awful. No resemblance at all to the quality of her other books. The entire book revolves around Andy Brazil who is a boring nobody with an alcoholic mother. There are never any climaxes. I finally forced myself to finish it today after struggling over a month to read it. The end was nothing!!! Totally frustrating that I wasted so much time trying to finish hoping the end would justify the boring body. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

The reason is a mystery, but clues point to estrogen-enhanced sewage. Which is the best summary of this article?","output":"The article discusses a peculiar phenomenon currently occurring in the Potomac River, where male smallmouth bass were found to be growing eggs. This unusual discovery has baffled scientists and anglers alike. The cause of this occurrence is not definitively known; however, the investigators are studying various possible explanations. The prominent hypothesis that has emerged points to estrogen-enhanced sewage seeping into the river as the likely cause. It is argued that high levels of estrogen, a primary female hormone, may be altering the natural biological characteristics of male fishes, triggering the development of eggs in them. The estrogen present in the river water supposedly originates from sewage that carries residues of drugs, personal care products, and other household materials containing synthetic and natural estrogens used by humans and disposed of down their drains.  These pollutants, when not adequately removed during wastewater treatment, can find their way into natural water bodies and significantly disturb the hormonal balance in aquatic animals, often causing intersex conditions as observed in the male bass. If proven, this could bring to light a serious environmental issue which could be impacting other wildlife populations, potentially causing long-term consequences to entire ecosystems. Comprehensive and rigorous investigation efforts are needed to establish this cause-effect link definitively and to understand all the implications of this situation. The scenario reflects broader concerns about environmental pollution, particularly water pollution, and its multifaceted detrimental impacts on wildlife. It further underscores the imperative need for stringent regulatory mechanisms for wastewater treatment processes to prevent such pollution episodes, and to preserve biodiversity and maintain the health of our ecosystems. Further research and long-term studies on a larger scale need to be carried out to verify this hypothesis and possibly uncover any other contributing factors. Moving forward, researchers intend to continue monitoring the river and fish populations for more evidence of such abnormal occurrences and trace potential sources of estrogenic compounds. Depending on the results, this might prompt significant changes in the way we manage human waste, or any other potential source of hormone pollution, to prevent such ecological disturbances in future. In the mean time, this intriguing scientific mystery serves as a stark reminder of the delicate balance between human activities and the natural environment, emphasizing once again the profound interconnections within our ecosystems and the critical role we play in its preservation or degradation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: James Johnson born in 1774, was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky, what's the name of his brother, the ninth Vice President of the United States?

After long realizing that I haven't yet to experience Korean in Montreal,my friend's Korean craving became a friday night dinner for 2 but ordering for 6. haha  As a suggestion to us from a couple of people here, we checked out this little NDG establishment (when I say little we're talking like one tiny restaurant). I had just awoken from an 18 hour nap (I've been in an anemic tiredness that I can't seem to shake) so this was my breakfast.  We arrived to a line-up of about 10 people ahead of us, Personally this just peaked my interest even more!  It took about half an hour to seat us, and during that time, we just observed everyone's orders and took in the delicious smells. Th restaurant seats about 30 people total, with 3 two seaters and 6 four seaters, by the time we did sit down, we were starving! To my disappointment, they don't serve tea in the summertime, which seemed odd, but I made do with cold water.  We ordered: Dumplings, Seafood Pajeon (a pancake with seafood and veggies), spicy BBQ chicken, and Bibimbap (rice beef veggies, tofu, egg in a super hot stone bowl).  Going into this we knew we weren't going to finish it, but we decided that leftovers were a must.   The meal comes with the complimentary side dishes:  Sookju Namul - marinated bean sprouts (cold) Oijangajji muchim - pickled cucumbers Gamja Jorim - Korean potato salad Dongchimi - Kim Chi Radish Kim Chi - Cabbage  All delish!  The dumplings were super meaty, and although I've had better dumplings these were good. Not oversteamed, or dry. The Pajeon was excellent, the squid was tender not chewy, and it was very dense. The Bibimbap, was really flavourful and tasty, but I did want the rice to be able to really crisp up on the side of the stone bowl, which didnt happen. The BBQ chicken, was oerfect amount of spicy, and also went awesome with the white rice.   The total for our meal (no beverages) was 61 and we had enough to last another meal and a half each.

All students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately.Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States  Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day\\"outlook\\" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an anaiysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for development of air masses, fronts and storms. Considerable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather predictions, with identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological  stations. Extensive experiments are also in progress for weathef modification studies.

It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication. The algorithms are openly documented and may be used free of software patent restrictions. Development of the format was maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation (as part of the Ogg codec family) and later coordinated by the Opus working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Dublin is in the province of Leinster on Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey. The city has an urban area population of 1,345,402. The population of the Greater Dublin Area, , was 1,904,806 people.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - Snooker is a cue sport played on a table covered with a green cloth or baize, with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. A full-size table measures 11 ft 8 in × 5 ft 10 in (3569 mm x 1778 mm), commonly referred to as 12 × 6 ft.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.  - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house.  - Michael Judge is a former professional snooker player from the Republic of Ireland . He has not won a ranking event , coming closest in the 2004 Grand Prix , where he reached the semi-finals after victories over Mark Williams among others . His first ranking quarter - final was at the 1997 British Open  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.

Byers served during the occupation of Japan? Answer:","output":"The supreme commander of the Allied Powers when Major General Clovis E. Byers served during the occupation of Japan was General Douglas MacArthur.  General Douglas MacArthur, born on January 26, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, was an American five-star general who played a significant role during World War II as Commander of Allied Forces in the Pacific. Known for his leadership and strategic vision, MacArthur was one of the most decorated military leaders in United States history. Following the successful conclusion of World War II, MacArthur was tasked with overseeing the occupation of Japan, and he was given the role of Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. He held this position from 1945 to 1951, and his tenure was marked by comprehensive democratization and demilitarization reforms in the country, leading to the development of a new Japanese constitution and the establishment of a stable, democratic government. Major General Clovis E. Byers, born on December 5, 1899, in Monroe, South Dakota, was an accomplished officer of the US Army. During World War II, he served in various roles, including as Assistant Division Commander of the 7th Infantry Division. He arrived in Japan after the end of the war and participated in the occupation under General MacArthur's command. Byers was appointed as the Deputy Commanding General of the 24th Infantry Division and Commander of the 19th Infantry Regiment in September 1948. He subsequently moved to the 7th Infantry Division in Korea, in May 1950, as Chief of Staff, where he played a key role in organizing several battles and leading troops in combat. Together, General Douglas MacArthur and Major General Clovis E. Byers, under their respective roles, contributed significantly to the success of the occupation of Japan. Their leadership helped transform Japan from a war-ravaged country into a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous nation that eventually emerged stronger in the aftermath of the war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Cromwellian conquest completed the British colonisation of Ireland, which was merged into the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1653-59. It destroyed the native Irish Catholic land-owning classes and replaced them with colonists with a British identity. The bitterness caused by the Cromwellian settlement was a powerful source of Irish nationalism from the 17th century onwards. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, Charles II of England restored about a third of the confiscated land to the former landlords in the Act of Settlement 1662, but not all, as he needed political support from former parliamentarians in England. A generation later, during the Glorious Revolution, many of the Irish Catholic landed class tried to reverse the remaining Cromwellian settlement in the Williamite War in Ireland , where they fought en masse for the Jacobites. They were defeated once again, and many lost land that had been regranted after 1662. As a result, Irish and English Catholics did not become full political citizens of the British state again until 1829 and were legally barred from buying valuable interests in land until the Papists Act 1778. How many years did the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland last?","output":"The Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland lasted for a period of approximately 6 years. It was established in 1653, following the execution of King Charles I and the end of the English Civil War. Oliver Cromwell was declared Lord Protector of the newly-formed Commonwealth, and it continued until 1659. Shortly after Cromwell's death in 1658, his son Richard Cromwell briefly assumed power, but he was unable to maintain control, leading to political turmoil. The monarchy was eventually restored in 1660 with the ascension of Charles II as king, bringing the Commonwealth to an end and inaugurating the Restoration period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: Director Jehane Noujaim, whose “Control Room” was named best documentary by the Boston Society of Film Critics in 2004, will attend the Jan. 20 DocYard screening at the Brattle Theatre of her new documentary “The Square,” a powerful, on-the-ground look at Egypt’s revolutionary uprising. “The Square,” which Noujaim and her crew shot on the volatile streets in and around Cairo’s Tahrir Square for more than two years, won awards at both the Sundance Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival and has been short-listed for the best documentary Oscar. Noujaim is a graduate of Harvard University who was born in the United States, raised in Egypt, and moved to Boston in 1990. Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government is co-presenting the screening and discussion with The DocYard at the Brattle. “The Square” and Noujaim’s appearance is the second DocYard event of its new season, which runs to April. (There will then be a summer lineup). Since it was launched in 2010 by Ben Fowlie and Sara Archambault, The DocYard has established itself as one of the region’s premier programs of new documentaries and discussions with filmmakers. All the screenings are followed by in-person (or occasionally by Skype) appearances by directors or someone else closely involved with the making of the film. “Sara and I wanted to grow The DocYard at a rate so that we’d have the means to bring in filmmakers. It’s a major component to our mission,” says Fowlie, who is also the founder and director of the all-documentary Camden International Film Festival. “I’m not interested in just screening films. It’s about the process and engaging with the audience.” He draws on the many contacts he’s established through CIFF, and says during that event, he’s always looking for films that would work for The DocYard. Archambault is also close to many filmmakers and their projects through her dual roles as a producer and as the program director for the LEF Foundation, which sponsors The DocYard. Fowlie says LEF and its executive director, Lyda Kuth, are instrumental in helping The DocYard’s commitment to films and filmmakers “that push the boundaries of the form.” Besides its affiliation with LEF, the DocYard also draws on connections it has established with other area film programs and institutions including Harvard, the MFA, and MIT. On March 23 and 24, in partnership with both the Harvard Film Archive and the Balagan Film Series, The DocYard presents a two-night appearance by the internationally acclaimed artist/filmmaker Ben Russell. “A Spell to Ward Off the Darkness,” by Russell and fellow artist/director Ben Rivers, screens at the HFA on March 23. “Shorts by Ben Rivers and Ben Russell” will show at the Brattle the following night. Russell will engage in post-screening talks with audiences at both venues. The rest of the winter schedule also reflects the program’s mission to present a “diverse landscape” of the documentary form, says Fowlie. Jessica Oreck’s “Aatsinki: The Story of Arctic Cowboys” (Jan. 27) is an ethnographic documentary that follows two brothers and their families through a year as they herd wild reindeer in Finnish Lapland. Two films that look at the state of modern politics — AJ Schnack’s “Caucus” (Feb. 12) and Sierra Pettengill and Jamila Wignot’s “Town Hall” (April 14) — were featured in the 2013 CIFF. “They are companion pieces that I’m sure will generate really interesting conversations,” says Fowlie. The DocYard tries to mix emerging and legendary filmmakers, and has achieved something of a coup this season with appearances from Peter Davis and Alan Berliner. Davis directed the 1974 Oscar-winning classic “Hearts and Minds” (April 7), about the United States’ involvement in Vietnam. Veteran filmmaker Alan Berliner appears with his latest film, “First Cousin, Once Removed” (March 10), his deeply personal portrait of his friend, cousin and mentor, the poet and teacher Edwin Honig, as he battles Alzheimer’s disease and memory loss. All DocYard screenings are at 7 p.m. For more information, go to www.thedocyard.com The Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston presents the only Boston screening of Best of the Ottawa International Animation Film Festival, with screenings on Jan. 9 at 7 p.m. and Jan. 18 and 19 at 3 p.m. This annual event includes highlights from the 2013 festival, with 11 films (on video format) that offer a variety of animation styles and subject matter.

But it seems that four out of five young people now get on well with their parents, which is the opposite of the popularly-held image of unhappy teenagers locked in their room after endless family quarrels. An important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly shows that their family life is more harmonious than it had ever been in the past. \\"We were surprised by just how positive today's young people seem to be about their families,\\" said one number of the research team. \\"They're expected to be rebellious and selfish but actually they have other things on their minds: they want a car and material goods, and they worry about whether school is serving them well. There's more negotiation and discussion between parents and children, and children expect to take part in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat.\\" So it seems that this generation of parents is much more likely than parents of 30 years ago to treat their children as friends. \\"My parents are happy to discuss things with me and willing to listen to me,\\" says 17-year-old Daniel Lazall. \\"I always tell them when I'm going out clubbing.

Question: Background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  Paragraph: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would Kettle Foods potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than PepsiCo'? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Kettle Foods potatoes would likely be less herbicide-tolerant than PepsiCo's potatoes. This is because Kettle Foods is using non-GMO potato seeds, while PepsiCo is using GMO potato seeds which potentially include the herbicide-resistance trait. GMO crops such as those used by PepsiCo often have added herbicide tolerance, allowing them to withstand exposure to specific herbicides without harm. In contrast, non-GMO crops like those used by Kettle Foods do not have this engineered resistance and may be more susceptible to herbicide damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It has a lot of butter in it.\\" is true? Select from: A). no. B). yes.","output":"B). Yes. If the statement \\"I put the cake away in the refrigerator. It has a lot of butter in it.\\" is taken to be true, then it is logical to conclude that \\"The cake has a lot of butter in it.\\" To understand this, let's break down the given sentence. The statement connects two sentences - \\"I put the cake away in the refrigerator\\" and \\"It has a lot of butter in it\\" - using a full stop, but they're still related.  In the second sentence, the pronoun \\"It\\" is used. Typically, pronouns are used to replace a noun or a noun phrase that has already been mentioned or easily identified, which is called the antecedent. In this context, \\"it\\" clearly refers to 'the cake' from the previous sentence. So, \\"it has a lot of butter in it\\" can be read as \\"the cake has a lot of butter in it\\", direct substitution of the antecedent. Therefore, we can indeed conclude that \\"The cake has a lot of butter in it\\" based on the given true statement. This also implies that the butter content in the cake must be high enough to be significant. Whether this is desirable or not would depend on different factors such as dietary needs, personal preference, and the specific recipe of the cake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Saido Berahino was put \\"on the naughty chair\\" by his West Brom manager Tony Pulis after the striker said that \\"he hoped to move on to bigger things\\".\\" Article:","output":"Title: Saido Berahino: From the \\"Naughty Chair\\" to Rising Star - A Path Towards Redemption Introduction: Saido Berahino, the talented West Bromwich Albion striker, has had his share of ups and downs in his career. In the past, his controversial remarks and rebellious attitude have often overshadowed his skills on the field. One such incident was when his then-manager, Tony Pulis, placed him \\"on the naughty chair,\\" following Berahino's public statement of wanting to move on to \\"bigger things.\\" This article will delve into the details of that incident and reveal how Berahino managed to turn his career around despite making headlines for the wrong reasons. Main Body: The infamous \\"naughty chair\\" incident took place in 2015 when Saido Berahino was still making a name for himself at West Brom. His performances during the previous season had caught the eye of several top Premier League clubs. While it is natural for any ambitious player to dream of playing for a more celebrated team, Berahino's public expression of his desire to move away from The Hawthorns only served to alienate him from his manager and teammates. Instead of garnering support, Berahino found himself in the bad books of Tony Pulis, the West Brom manager at the time, who seemed visibly disappointed by the striker's lack of commitment towards his current employer. The disgruntled manager decided to teach Berahino a lesson and assigned him to the \\"naughty chair\\" situated in the far corner of the dressing room, a measure to humiliate and discipline the young forward. The implications of such a move sent a clear message to Berahino – either conform to the rules and respect the team or risk being an outcast in his own dressing room. This was not the first time Berahino had faced disciplinary action; he had been previously axed from the squad due to his attitude and poor time-keeping. However, Berahino's exile did not last long, as he eventually garnered the humility needed to resolve the matter with his manager. Recognizing the need to disassociate his off-pitch controversies from his on-field performances, Berahino worked tirelessly to win back the respect of his manager and teammates. This paid off as the striker not only regained his place in the West Brom team, but gradually progressed into an essential asset for the club. Fast forward to the present, and Saido Berahino stands as a symbol of redemption. After overcoming various challenges throughout his career, Berahino has emerged as an influential figure in the world of football. His performances with West Brom ultimately led him to secure a move to Stoke City in January 2017. Although his time with Stoke was initially marred by off-field controversies, Berahino has since managed to find his footing. Most recently, he has been showcasing his form with Belgian club Zulte Waregem, where his goal-scoring prowess has truly come to the fore. Conclusion: The story of Saido Berahino serves as a testament to the importance of discipline, humility, and perseverance in the world of professional football. The \\"naughty chair\\" incident may have been one of the lowest points in the striker's career, but it can also be seen as a turning point, a moment that forced Berahino to reassess his priorities and regain focus. Presently, with his excellent performances on the field and a positive attitude off it, Berahino stands tall as a rising star who has learned from his mistakes, determined to move forward and make his mark on the world of football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a correct answer to the following question about Controlled Substances Act. Yes or no? Answer: The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. Question: what is tylenol 3 on schedule of drugs A:","output":"To answer this question, I need to determine the schedule of Tylenol 3 according to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Here are the steps I will take: 1. Identify the active ingredients in Tylenol 3: Tylenol 3 is a combination medication containing acetaminophen and codeine. It is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. 2. Understand the CSA's drug scheduling system: The CSA classifies drugs into five schedules (I to V) based on their potential for abuse, accepted medical use, and potential for physical or psychological dependence. Schedule I drugs have the highest potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, while Schedule V drugs have the lowest potential for abuse and are widely used for medical purposes. 3. Determine the schedule for codeine: Codeine, one of the active ingredients in Tylenol 3, is an opioid analgesic. Opioids are classified under different schedules depending on their specific formulation and concentration. Codeine itself is a Schedule II substance, but its combination with acetaminophen in certain concentrations falls under Schedule III. 4. Verify the schedule for Tylenol 3: Tylenol 3 contains a lower concentration of codeine than Schedule II narcotics and also contains acetaminophen. Therefore, Tylenol 3 is classified as a Schedule III drug according to the CSA. Answer: Tylenol 3 is a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Marguerite \\"Peggy\\" Guggenheim (August 26, 1898 - December 23, 1979) was an American art collector, bohemian and socialite. Born to the wealthy New York City Guggenheim family, she was the daughter of Benjamin Guggenheim, who went down with the Titanic in 1912, and the niece of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who would establish the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Peggy Guggenheim created a noted art collection in Europe and America primarily between 1938 and 1946. She exhibited this collection as she built it and in 1949, settled in Venice, where she lived and exhibited her collection for the rest of her life. When Peggy Guggenheim realized that her gallery, although well received, had made a loss of PS600 in the first year, she decided to spend her money in a more practical way. A museum for contemporary arts was exactly the institution she could see herself supporting. Most certainly on her mind also were the adventures in New York City of her uncle, Solomon R. Guggenheim, who, with the help and encouragement of Hilla Rebay, had created the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation two years earlier. The main aim of this foundation had been to collect and to further the production of abstract art, resulting in the opening of the Museum of Non-objective Painting (from 1952: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) earlier in 1939 on East 54th Street in Manhattan. Peggy Guggenheim closed Guggenheim Jeune with a farewell party on 22 June 1939, at which colour portrait photographs by Gisele Freund were projected on the walls. She started making plans for a Museum of Modern Art in London together with the English art historian and art critic Herbert Read. She set aside 40,000 for the museum's running costs. However, these funds were soon overstretched with the organisers' ambitions.  In August 1939, Peggy Guggenheim left for Paris to negotiate loans of artworks for the first exhibition. In her luggage was a list drawn up by Herbert Read for this occasion. Shortly after her departure the Second World War broke out, and the events following 1 September 1939 made her abandon the scheme, willingly or not. She then \\"decided now to buy paintings by all the painters who were on Herbert Read's list. Having plenty of time and all the museum's funds at my disposal, I put myself on a regime to buy one picture a day.\\" When finished, she had acquired ten Picassos, forty Ernsts, eight Miros, four Magrittes, three Man Rays, three Dalis, one Klee, one Wolfgang Paalen and one Chagall among others. In the meantime, she had also made new plans and in April 1940 had rented a large space in the Place Vendome as a new home for her museum.  A few days before the Germans reached Paris, Peggy Guggenheim had to abandon her plans for a Paris museum, and fled to the south of France, from where, after months of safeguarding her collection and artist friends, she left Europe for New York in the summer of 1941. There, in the following year, she opened a new gallery which actually was in part a museum at 30 West 57th Street. It was called The Art of This Century Gallery. Three of the four galleries were dedicated to Cubist and Abstract art, Surrealism and Kinetic art, with only the fourth, the front room, being a commercial gallery. Peggy Guggenheim held important shows, such as the show for 31 Women artists, at the gallery as well.  Her interest in new art was instrumental in advancing the careers of several important modern artists including the American painters Jackson Pollock and William Congdon, the Austrian surrealist Wolfgang Paalen, the sound poet Ada Verdun Howell and the German painter Max Ernst, whom she married in December 1941. She had assembled her collection in only seven years. did she make it withouta ny problems?","output":"Peggy Guggenheim faced several problems and obstacles while building her collection and establishing her galleries and museums. Some of the challenges she encountered include: 1. Financial losses: In the first year of her gallery, Guggenheim Jeune, she made a loss of £600. This led her to consider investing her money in a more practical way, such as supporting a museum for contemporary arts. 2. World War II: Peggy Guggenheim's plans for a Museum of Modern Art in London with art historian and critic Herbert Read, and later her plans for a Paris museum, were disrupted by the outbreak of World War II. In September 1939, she abandoned the London museum project and started buying paintings instead. In 1940, she had to abandon her plans for a Paris museum as well when the Germans approached Paris. 3. Safekeeping her collection during wartime: As the war escalated, Guggenheim had to safeguard her collection and her artist friends. She eventually left Europe for New York in the summer of 1941. 4. Assembling her collection in a short time: Peggy Guggenheim managed to assemble her significant collection in just seven years. This likely involved challenges such as finding and securing the desired artworks, negotiating with artists or sellers, and handling the logistics of acquiring pieces from different locations. Despite these obstacles, Guggenheim was successful in creating a renowned art collection and supporting the careers of several important modern artists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: when was the last time the mariners went to the world series?","output":"The Seattle Mariners have never reached the World Series in their franchise history since their inception in 1977. They have had some notable seasons, particularly in 1995 and 2001. However, they have not been able to advance past the American League Championship Series (ALCS) to compete in the World Series. The closest the Mariners came to reaching the World Series was in 1995 when they won their first American League West division title. The team found themselves in the ALCS after they famously defeated the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series (ALDS) in a thrilling 5-game series, which culminated in a memorable Game 5, where Edgar Martinez hit a two-run double, known as \\"The Double,\\" to score Ken Griffey Jr. as the winning run in the bottom of the 11th inning. In the 1995 ALCS, the Mariners faced the Cleveland Indians but ultimately lost in six games. Cleveland went on to the World Series but lost to the Atlanta Braves.

Movie title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found. Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they find a vent to navigate to different rooms that have its doors locked on both sides. Thereby, they... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Bad Kids Go to Hell,\\" the death of Jacob Rainwater is connected to the dark history of Crestview Academy and the land on which it was built. The land was originally owned by Jacob Rainwater, an Apache man, who lived there in the 1870s. When General Andrew Winston Clarke stole the land from the Apache tribe, this ultimately led to the death of Jacob Rainwater. The movie does not explicitly explain how Jacob was killed, but it is implied that his death was a result of the violent actions and injustices committed by General Clarke and his successors. As the students discover the tragic history of their school, they also uncover that the library, where the movie is set, is said to be haunted. The haunting is believed to be connected to Jacob Rainwater and the injustices committed against him and his people. The events in the film begin unraveling as the students delve deeper into the school's history and start experiencing strange, terrifying occurrences. These events are seemingly tied to the haunting, and the students, realizing the connection to Jacob Rainwater and the stolen land, try to uncover the truth behind the evil forces at work. Ultimately, the question of \\"Why did they kill Jacob?\\" ties into the movie's themes of corruption, greed, and the consequences of past injustices. The killing of Jacob Rainwater serves as a metaphor for the larger, systemic violence that the Apache tribe and other marginalized groups have faced throughout history. In \\"Bad Kids Go to Hell,\\" Jacob's death and the haunting that follows can be seen as a reminder that the sins of the past can cast a long, dark shadow on the present. As you consider whether to invest in this film proposal, keep in mind the story's exploration of historical themes and the supernatural, which may resonate with audiences and offer engaging performances and visuals for a movie experience.

To do this, let's add 190 to both sides of the equation: -10*z - 190 + 190 = 0 + 190 -10*z = 190 Finally, let's divide both sides by -10 to find z: z = 190 / -10 z = -19 So the answer is z = -19."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

One lucky buyer wrote in an online comment: \\"Rushed to purchase, but to my shame, I have not read any of his novels.\\"     Although Mo was entitled one of the top China's literature awards before the Nobel Prize, he is not the most popular novelist in China, in either the book market or in reputation.     Chinese media seemed to be shocked as some journalists were reported to be on their way overnight to Gaomi City of East China's Shandong Province, Mo's birthplace where he stayed with his family.     Born in 1955 into a rural family, Mo dropped out of school and became a farmer when he was a teenager. He joined the army and devoted himself to writing. Mo's novels were translated into several languages.     For more than a century, Nobel Prize has been regarded by the world as recognition to an individual or even a nation's cultural and scientific advances.     \\"I think the reason why I could win the prize is that my works present lives with unique Chinese characteristics, and they also tell stones from a viewpoint of common human beings, which transcends differences of nations and races,\\" Mo said on Thursday evening to Chinese journalists.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Alfonso Ferrero , Cavaliere La Marmora ( Italian pronunciation : ( alfnso la marmora ) ; November 18 , 1804 -- January 5 , 1878 ) was an Italian general and statesman . His older brothers include soldier and naturalist Alberto della Marmora and Alessandro La Marmora , founder of the branch of the Italian army now called the Bersaglieri .  - The Kingdom of Sardinia was a state in Southern Europe which existed from the early 14th until the mid-19th century. It was the predecessor state of today's Italy.  - The Italian Army (Italian: Esercito Italiano; EI) is the land defence force of the Italian Armed Forces of the Italian Republic. The army's history dates back to the unification of Italy in the 1850s and 1860s. The army fought in colonial engagements in China, Libya (19111912), northern Italy against the Austro-Hungarian Empire during World War I, Abyssinia before World War II, and in World War II in Albania, Greece, north Africa, Russia and Italy itself. During the Cold War the army prepared itself to defend against a Warsaw Pact invasion from the east. Since the end of the Cold War the army has seen extensive peacekeeping service and combat in Afghanistan and Iraq.  - The Royal Italian Army (Italian: \\"Regio Esercito Italiano\\") was the army of the Kingdom of Italy from the unification of Italy in 1861 to the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946. In World War II the Royal Army fought first as part of the Axis (193943) and then as part of the Allies (194345). After the monarchy ended, the army changed its name to become the Italian Army (\\"Esercito Italiano\\").  - Alberto Ferrero La Marmora (or Della Marmora; 7 April 1789  18 March 1863) was an Italian soldier and naturalist. He was elder brother to Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora, soldier and founder of the Bersaglieri, and to Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, Italian general and statesman.  - Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora (March 27, 1799 in Turin, Kingdom of Sardinia  June 7, 1855 in Balaklava, Russian Empire) was an Italian general who is best remembered for founding the military unit known as the Bersaglieri. Two of his brothers were Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora and Alberto Ferrero la Marmora, the naturalist.  - The Bersaglieri (Marksmen in English) are a corps of the Italian Army originally created by General Alessandro La Marmora on 18 June 1836 to serve in the Army of the Kingdom of Sardinia, later to become the Royal Italian Army. They have always been a high-mobility light infantry unit, and can still be recognized by the distinctive wide brimmed hat that they wear (only in dress uniform in modern times), decorated with black capercaillie feathers. The feathers are usually applied to their combat helmets. Another distinctive trait of the Bersaglieri is the fast jog pace they keep on parades, instead of marching.

Summarize this article: While this may seem excessive, it's actually a vital part of removing fleas from your home. Since fleas lay eggs that may hatch after you've treated your pet, you need to remove the eggs and larvae that fall to the floor or on furniture. Vacuum every day for a few weeks to ensure that a new cycle of fleas won't trouble you.  Remember to throw the vacuum bag away in an outdoor dumpster or empty the bagless vacuum canister into the outdoor dumpster. If you leave the dirt in the vacuum bag or canister, the fleas can easily work their way back into your home.  Eggs and fleas can also get trapped in the fabric on couches, pet bedding and other upholstered furniture. Vacuum upholstery every day for a few weeks. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural and safe alternative for killing fleas in your house. DE is similar in consistency to talcum powder.  It can be sprinkled on carpets, baseboards, and other places in your house. Let it sit for a few days and then vacuum it up. This type of insecticide will restrict the growth of fleas and eggs. Check that the product will kill fleas/eggs for up to 7 months. Strictly follow the instructions. Make sure to remove all pets from the area when you are applying this insecticide. Don't forget birds and other pets in cages. Be sure to also cover aquariums when using these products. Strip as much of the fabric off your couches, chairs, and bed as you can. Then, wash it in the hottest water your fabric will allow. This should kill fleas and their eggs. Gather up any clothes that may be lying around, especially piles of laundry. Fleas will nest in fabrics. Washing and drying on the hottest setting possible will kill fleas and eggs. Summary:","output":"To effectively remove fleas from your home, vacuum daily for several weeks to eliminate eggs and larvae in both floor surfaces and upholstery. Dispose of vacuum contents in an outdoor dumpster. Use diatomaceous earth (DE) as a natural flea-killing solution—sprinkle it around your home, wait a few days, then vacuum it up. Follow product instructions carefully and remove pets while applying the insecticide. Additionally, wash removable fabric from furniture and clothes in hot water to kill fleas and their eggs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Regardless of how you've chosen to hunt, this is one step that will be the same throughout. If you're hunting pigs, this should not be your first time using whichever weapon you've chosen; a pig hunt is not the place to learn a new weapon. You're going to want to choose a weapon that you're confident you can make a clean, humane shot with when required.  No matter what weapon you're using, the best shot will be one to the heart and lungs, behind the pig's front shoulders. Aim for the shoulder itself, high on the pig's leg. This shot is the best because the cardiac/pulmonary damage will be such that you won't need to trail for long. Another plausible shot for those with high caliber weapons (bows and handguns not included) is the neck. You'll be aiming for halfway between the bottom of the ear and the top of the shoulder. When done correctly, this shot will sever the spinal cord and the animal will drop quickly. Never make a shot you're unsure of. A lightly wounded wild pig can quickly become a dangerous enemy; pigs are known for their preference to fight over flight. It is also inhumane to leave a non-fatal wound in a pig. Shoot only when you're cool and comfortable, and know where the bullet will land. Once you've shot the wild pig, there's a good chance that it won't go down immediately. Many pigs wounded in the chest will run for a good bit before tiring and laying down to die. You have an obligation as a hunter to find and dispatch any pig you've shot, no matter what.  If the pig has run off, mark the spot where it was when you first shot it. This will come in handy as a reference point. Focus on any blood the animal has left behind; usually the wound you've made will leave a trail of blood in the direction of the wounded pig. Look out for signs on trees and bushes as well. Be sure to not just focus on the ground, but look up and around as the pig may be a ways ahead of you, but still visible. As mentioned, a single bullet (even in the right place) may not be enough to kill a pig quickly and humanely. Once you've located the wounded pig, you'll need to finish it off out of mercy and respect. Take extreme care in doing so, as even a downed and wounded pig may pose a threat to you.  The best choice is a second shot, either to the head or again to the chest cavity, into the heart and lungs. Many prefer to do this with a handgun for ease of use. If the pig is relatively close to death and safe to approach, you may use a knife to cut the throat or stab the heart (angled thrust, under a front leg) to finish a wild pig. If you're hunting wild pig, chances are you aim to keep the meat of the animal just downed. To do this you'll need to attend to the body quickly (gutted, skinned, and cooled)--pig carcasses can spoil quickly, especially in hot weather. To transport the carcass, tie your rope around the back hooves and drag it with you.  For safety, you'll want to use rubber gloves when handling the pig carcass. Once you've got the carcass where you'd like to skin it, hang it with the head pointing up to begin the process. Using your knife, cut skin-deep all the way around the neck. From the cut made around the neck, use your knife to cut the skin in strips off of the pig's body. Once skinned, hang in a shady place to dry and cool (down from living, body temperature). As with any meat, you'll want to take every precaution when storing and keeping game meat. Once the meat has cooled to room temperature and dried out some, it should be butchered and left to freeze, covered in butcher's paper.  When handling the meat or cutting through it, be especially careful to avoid nicking either the bladder or the intestines. Cutting into either will spill the contents, ruining the meat. Come time to eat the meat, be sure to cook it completely (to 170 degrees Fahrenheit) so that any lingering parasites or bacteria are totally killed off. Any meat you don't eat needs to be disposed of quickly and correctly. Don't dump it and allow other wildlife or your pets to get to it.

OPT: (I) no; (II) yes;","output":"(I) no Dhammavinaya and Buddhism are not paraphrases of each other but are related concepts within the Buddhist tradition. Let's dive into the explanation of both terms to understand their distinct meanings and ideas. Buddhism: Buddhism is a religion and philosophical system founded by Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha, more than 2,500 years ago in India. It is based on the teachings and insights of the Buddha, which he attained after achieving enlightenment. The fundamental principles of Buddhism are the Three Jewels: the Buddha (the enlightened one), the Dharma (his teachings), and the Sangha (the monastic community of practitioners). Buddhism aims to cultivate wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline to help individuals achieve liberation from suffering and attain enlightenment (Nirvana). It is important to note that there are various branches and schools of Buddhism, such as Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, each with its unique interpretations and practices. However, the core teachings remain the same, which are the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Dhammavinaya: Dhammavinaya is a Pali term that refers to the teachings and practices that guide Buddhists on their path to enlightenment. It is made up of two words – Dhamma (or Dharma in Sanskrit), which means the teachings or the truth about the nature of existence, and Vinaya, which refers to the monastic discipline that regulates the Buddhist monastic community (Sangha). These two components, Dhamma and Vinaya, form the foundation of the Buddhist tradition. Dhamma encompasses the core doctrines of Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the Three Marks of Existence, and the various teachings on mindfulness, meditation, ethics, and mental development. The Vinaya, on the other hand, comprises a set of rules and guidelines for the conduct of monks and nuns within the Sangha. It regulates areas such as personal behavior, interpersonal relationships, and community life, emphasizing the importance of ethical discipline as an essential part of spiritual progress. In summary, while Dhammavinaya and Buddhism are closely related, they are not paraphrases of each other. Buddhism is the overarching religion and philosophical system, whereas Dhammavinaya represents the teachings and discipline that guide practitioners on their spiritual path within the Buddhist tradition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Interpret the hypothesis The hypothesis asserts that private savings decrease as the federal government saving increases. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis mention a relationship between federal government savings and private savings. The premise suggests that an increase in federal government saving may lead to a decrease in private savings, while the hypothesis states that private savings decrease as federal government saving increases. Step 4: Assess the level of certainty The premise uses the word \\"may,\\" which implies that there's a possibility of the stated relationship between federal government saving and private saving, but it's not entirely definite. In contrast, the hypothesis presents the relationship as a concrete fact, without any uncertainty. Step 5: Conclusion Based on the premise, we can't definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Private savings lower as the federal government saving increases\\" is true. While the premise suggests a possible relationship between the two variables, it doesn't confirm the relationship as a fact.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming.

Article: British lawmakers are calling for a tax on disposable coffee cups sold at retail establishments in a bid to reduce litter and refuse sent to landfills. The U.K. parliament's Environmental Audit Committee wants a so-called \\"latte levy\\" of 25 pence (about 33 cents) slapped on each cup sold, with the idea being to encourage coffee consumers to bring their own reusable cups.      \\"The UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year -- that's enough to circle the planet five and a half times,\\" admonished committee chair Mary Creagh, according to CBS News partner network BBC News.      \\"Almost none are recycled and half a million a day are littered. Coffee cup producers and distributors have not taken action to rectify this and government has sat on its hands. The UK's coffee shop market is expanding rapidly, so we need to kick start a revolution in recycling.\\"      The government, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, expressed agreement that more measures were needed to reduce the amount of plastic waste discarded in Britain, but said it would wait to see evidence on the efficacy of such taxes on single-use packaging.      One of the world's biggest coffee retailers wasn't waiting, however. Starbucks said it would begin applying a more modest 5 pence per-cup charge in a couple dozen of its London stores in February. The trial was to last three months, and Starbucks noted that it already offers a 25 pence discount to customers who bring in their own cups.      There is predictable opposition to the idea of a per-disposable cup tax by the people who make such cups in Britain. Mike Turner, of the Paper Cup Alliance, told the BBC that paper cups are the most safe, sustainable solution for Britons to enjoy beverages on the go.      \\"The paper cups we manufacture in the UK are sustainably sourced, responsibly produced, recyclable and, through a number of facilities, are being recycled. We are committed to increasing recycling rates,\\" he told the BBC.      \\"Taxing the morning coffee run will not address the issue of litter, but it will hurt consumers and impact already struggling High Streets.\\"      Tim Farron, leader of the U.K.'s Liberal Democrats party, which has long backed such a cup tax, disagrees.      \\"I'm glad our call for a coffee cup charge is gaining traction,\\" he said. \\"The evidence is clear that these levies work -- the 5p charge on plastic bags has massively reduced usage and helped protect our environment.\\" ||||| A coffee drinker holds a disposable cup in London on Jan. 5. British lawmakers are considering a 'latte levy' to cut down on coffee cup waste in Britain.      —Britain should charge a 25 pence (0.34) \\"latte levy\\" on disposable coffee cups to cut down waste and ban them if a recycling target is not met by 2023, a committee of lawmakers said on Friday.      Less than 1 percent of coffee cups are recycled in Britain because of the tightly bonded plastic liner, the difficulties of recycling packaging which has been in contact with food and drink and a lack of facilities, the lawmakers said.      Chains Pret A Manger, Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero, and Greggs alongside US firm Starbucks are among the biggest coffee-sellers in Britain and have rapidly expanded in the past 10 years to meet increasing demand.      Although some outlets give a discount to customers using their own cup, only 1 to 2 percent of buyers take up the offer, according to parliament's environmental audit committee which said a \\"latte levy\\" was needed instead.      \\"The UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year; enough to circle the planet five and a half times,\\" said chair of the committee, Mary Creagh.      \\"We're calling for action to reduce the number of single use cups, promote reusable cups over disposable cups and to recycle all coffee cups by 2023,\\" she said.      The committee said that money raised by the charge should help improve recycling facilities and if the 2023 target is not met then disposable coffee cups should be banned.      The Irish parliament is considering banning single-use coffee cups while the German city Hamburg said in 2016 it will no longer use coffeemakers with aluminum capsules in its own offices or buildings.      In October 2015, Britain introduced a charge of 5 pence on all single-use plastic bags provided by large shops, which led to an 83 percent reduction in plastic bags used in the first year.      On Friday the environment ministry said the government was working closely with the sector and had made progress in increasing recycling rates.      \\"We are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups,\\" said a ministry spokeswoman.      \\"We will carefully consider the committee’s recommendations and respond shortly,\\" she said.      Caffe Nero said it was working with others to understand and address the issues which prevent the widespread recycling of paper cups.      Costa Coffee and Greggs said they offered a discount to those using reusable cups but Costa said the government also needed to focus on improving recycling infrastructure. Pret A Manger's customers have benefitted from a 50 pence discount from this week.      US chain Starbucks will trial a 5 pence levy at up to 25 London branches in February for three months.

A report by the Environmental Audit Committee says the tax should be used to improve the UK's recycling and reprocessing facilities.      The MPs say throwaway cups should be prohibited altogether by 2023 if they are not all being recycled.      In response, Starbucks said it would try out a 5p cup charge in 20 to 25 central London outlets.      \\"We will begin the trial in February and initially it will last for three months,\\" the firm said, adding that it continued to offer a 25p discount to customers who brought their own reusable cups.      The government agrees plastic waste is a problem and will seek evidence on a tax on single-use plastics.      'Revolution' needed      The committee's chair, Mary Creagh MP, said: \\"The UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year - that's enough to circle the planet five and a half times.      \\"Almost none are recycled and half a million a day are littered. Coffee cup producers and distributors have not taken action to rectify this and government has sat on its hands.      \\"The UK's coffee shop market is expanding rapidly, so we need to kick start a revolution in recycling.\\"      The Liberal Democrats said they had been campaigning for a charge on coffee cups since September 2016 and were the only party to include the policy in their 2017 election manifesto.      The party's environment spokesman, Tim Farron, said: \\"I'm glad our call for a coffee cup charge is gaining traction.      \\"The evidence is clear that these levies work - the 5p charge on plastic bags has massively reduced usage and helped protect our environment.\\"      The proposed 25p levy is being opposed by the makers of paper cups.      Mike Turner, of the Paper Cup Alliance, said paper cups were the most sustainable and safe solution for drinks on the go.      \\"The paper cups we manufacture in the UK are sustainably sourced, responsibly produced, recyclable and, through a number of facilities, are being recycled. We are committed to increasing recycling rates,\\" he said.      \\"Taxing the morning coffee run will not address the issue of litter, but it will hurt consumers and impact already struggling High Streets.\\"      The MPs point out that while some coffee shops offer discounts for customers who bring their own cup, only 1 to 2% of coffee drinkers respond.      Following the success of the plastic bag charge, they have concluded that consumers respond more to sticks than to carrots.      The plastic lining in coffee cups makes them costly to recycle, and the MPs say the businesses supplying and producing them do not bear the full costs of their disposal.      Disposable coffee cups are technically recyclable, but most are not because the UK has just three facilities that can split the paper and plastic components for recycling.      The committee has called on the government to require coffee cups from cafes without in-store recycling systems to carry \\"not widely recycled\\" labels to increase consumer awareness. Cafes with in-store recycling systems should print their cups with \\"recyclable in store only\\", the MPs add.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall backs the 'latte levy'      The committee's recommendations were welcomed by environmental campaigners.      Fiona Nicholls from Greenpeace UK, said the problem was getting bigger: \\"We must not allow the packaging industry to water down these recommendations any further.\\"      Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, chef and campaigner, said: \\"The UK has woken up and smelled the coffee cup nightmare.      \\"The committee has recognised that the huge mountain of disposable coffee cups is effectively unrecyclable, and is overwhelming and disrupting the nation's waste disposal systems, ultimately polluting our rivers and seas, and needs urgent action.\\"      The British Coffee Association's Chris Stemman also welcomed the report's broad principles, but said a levy was not the answer.      \\"It places an unfair and additional cost on coffee drinking consumers only - despite paper cups only contributing 0.7% of total paper packaging waste,\\" he told BBC News.      \\"We urge the government to ensure that if any potential tax is considered, that it is ring-fenced and used specifically to invest in new 'binfrastructure' and to improve recycling processes with local authorities that make it easier to separate and stream paper cups and other waste products.\\"      Mr Stemman said the industry should continue to focus on other environmental issues such as cutting water use, carbon reduction, and turning waste coffee grounds into biofuel.      The government plans to produce a new plastics policy later in the year.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under?  Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store. On Ben's first night of patrol he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (who died at the beginning of the film). Inside is a note that says \\"Esseker\\". After viewing Garyâs crime photos Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing. Meanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie (Amy Smart) is killed by her reflection as it grips its jaw and slowly pull its mouth apart, causing her to bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film takes place in the isolated village of Killary on the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland during World War I. The villagers are nationalist and exclusionary, taunting Michael (John Mills) (the mute village idiot) and British soldiers stationed at a nearby army base. They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as \\"our boys\\".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village. Rosy is in love with the local schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum), a widower older than herself. She imagines that Shaughnessy will be able to add excitement to her life because he is educated and listens to classical music. He tries to convince her they are not a good match and suggests she leave the village and see the world. The two ultimately marry, but Rosy quickly becomes discontented with her marriage. She is looking for passion beyond just love in her relationship.Major Randolph Doryan (Christopher Jones) arrives to take command of the local army base. A veteran of World War I, he has been awarded a Victoria Cross, but has a crippled leg and suffers from shell shock. Rosy is instantly attracted to him. When Michael absent-mindedly bangs his foot on the pub bench, it causes Doryan to have a flashback to the trenches and collapse. When he recovers, he is comforted by Rosy.

Information:  - The Swedish Academy, founded in 1786 by King Gustav III, is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. It is known for making the annual decision on who will be the laureate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded in memory of the donor Alfred Nobel.  - Roderick MacKinnon ( born 19 February 1956 ) is a professor of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics at Rockefeller University who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Peter Agre in 2003 for his work on the structure and operation of ion channels .  - The Nobel Committee for Chemistry is the Nobel Committee responsible for proposing laureates for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The Nobel Committee for Chemistry is appointed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It usually consists of Swedish professors of chemistry who are members of the Academy, although the Academy in principle could appoint anyone to the Committee.  - Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.  - The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM), located in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., is the academic medical teaching and research arm of Johns Hopkins University. Johns Hopkins has consistently been among the nation's top medical schools in the number of research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health. Its major teaching hospital, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, was ranked the #1 hospital in the United States for 22 years by \\"U.S. News & World Report\\".  - Nanotechnology (\\"nanotech\\") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \\"nanotechnologies\\" as well as \\"nanoscale technologies\\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.  - Aquaporins also called water channels, are integral membrane proteins from a larger family of major intrinsic proteins that form pores in the membrane of biological cells.  - Peter Agre (born January 30, 1949) is an American physician and molecular biologist, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute. In 2003, Agre and Roderick MacKinnon shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discoveries concerning channels in cell membranes. Agre was recognized for his discovery of aquaporin water channels. Aquaporins are water-channel proteins that move water molecules through the cell membrane. In 2009, Agre was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and became active in science diplomacy.  - Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics and chemical equilibrium.  - Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Jr. (30 August 1852  1 March 1911) was a Dutch physical chemist. A highly influential theoretical chemist of his time, van 't Hoff was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His pioneering work helped found the modern theory of chemical affinity, chemical equilibrium, chemical kinetics, and chemical thermodynamics. In his 1874 pamphlet Van't Hoff formulated the theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom and laid the foundations of stereochemistry. In 1875 he predicted the correct structures of allenes and cumulenes as well as their axial chirality. He is also widely considered one of the founders of physical chemistry as the discipline is known today.  - The Lasker Awards have been awarded annually since 1945 to living persons who have made major contributions to medical science or who have performed public service on behalf of medicine. They are administered by the Lasker Foundation, founded by Albert Lasker and his wife Mary Woodard Lasker (later a medical research activist). The awards are sometimes referred to as \\"America's Nobels\\". Lasker Award has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize. Eighty-six Lasker laureates have received the Nobel Prize, including 32 in the last two decades. Claire Pomeroy is the current President of the Foundation.  - The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) is part of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. As the first independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States, the Bloomberg School is a leading international authority on the improvement of health and prevention of disease and disability. The school's mission is to protect populations from illness and injury by pioneering new research, deploying its knowledge and expertise in the field, and educating scientists and practitioners in the global defense of human life. The school is ranked first in public health in the \\"U.S. News and World Report\\" rankings and has held that ranking since 1994.  - Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of water across a semipermeable membrane. It is also defined as the measure of the tendency of a solution to take in water by osmosis. Potential osmotic pressure is the maximum osmotic pressure that could develop in a solution if it were separated from distilled water by a selectively permeable membrane. The phenomenon of osmosis arises from the propensity of a pure solvent to move through a semi-permeable membrane and into a solution containing a solute to which the membrane is impermeable. This process is of vital importance in biology as the cell's membrane is semipermeable.  - The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or \\"Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien\\" is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. It is an independent, non-governmental scientific organisation which takes special responsibility for the natural sciences and mathematics, but endeavours to promote the exchange of ideas between various disciplines.  - The National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formerly the Institute of Medicine) is an American nonprofit, non-governmental organization. The National Academy of Medicine is a part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Research Council (NRC).   - Biophysics or biological physics is an interdisciplinary science that applies the approaches and methods of physics to study biological systems. Biophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, physical chemistry, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics and systems biology.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl.

In 1870, republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.

A:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break it down step-by-step and see how it affects the process. Hypothesis: Suppose less carbon dioxide and methane are produced.  1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide:     - If people expel less carbon dioxide, it means less greenhouse gas is released into the atmosphere. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide:     - If engines produce less carbon dioxide, again, fewer greenhouse gases would be released into the atmosphere. 3. Living things produce waste:     - This step doesn't directly affect the amount of greenhouse gases since the hypothesis is only about carbon dioxide and methane. 4. Waste decomposes:     - Less waste production would lead to less decomposition, but this step doesn't directly affect greenhouse gases. 5. Decomposition produces methane:     - If there's less decomposition due to less waste, this step would lead to less methane being produced and less greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. 6. Water evaporates:     - This step doesn't directly relate to greenhouse gases or our hypothesis. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere:     - Water vapor is a greenhouse gas, but this step doesn't directly affect the amount of carbon dioxide or methane in our hypothesis. 8. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane are greenhouse gases:     - In this step, the fact that these are greenhouse gases is mentioned. The perturbation hypothesis directly affects carbon dioxide and methane. The perturbation hypothesis would directly affect steps 1, 2, and 5 of the process, leading to less greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, it would also have indirect effects on steps 4 and 8 as the process of decomposition would be impacted and overall decreased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

If a capital letter is followed by lowercase letters, it can indicate the start of a new word. The first part is \\"Readthetexthere\\": - \\"Read\\" is one word as \\"R\\" is capital followed by lowercase letters. - The next group of lowercase letters after \\"Read\\" is \\"thetexthere\\". There is no capital letter to indicate the separation of words. So, I will analyze and find the individual words. - \\"the\\" seems to be a separate word in \\"thetexthere\\". - The remaining string is \\"texthere\\".  - Now, I have \\"text\\" and \\"here\\" as two separate words in \\"texthere\\". So, the first part becomes: \\"Read the text here\\" The second part is \\"bookofhours\\": - Since \\"bookofhours\\" doesn't have any capital letter, I will analyze and find the individual words. - \\"book\\" seems to be a separate word in \\"bookofhours\\". - The remaining string is \\"ofhours\\". - \\"of\\" is another separate word in \\"ofhours\\". - Now, I have \\"hours\\" as the last word in \\"ofhours\\". So, the second part becomes: \\"book of hours\\" Step 3: Combine both parts with the punctuation \\": \\" that was originally present.

The computer, which works very fast, has information about all the 350,000 street addresses in the city. Within two or three seconds after a call is received, the computer provides necessary information for the fire fighters. The information is then sent to them by radio from the computer centre in the City Hall. The exact place of the burning building and its size, type and any other details are clear to them.    TheKansas Citycomputer system also has a medical record of each of the city's 900 fire fighters. This kind of information is especially useful when a fire fighter is injured. With the information, doctors at hospital can treat the injured fire fighters more quickly and easily.    The fire fighters themselves greatly appreciate   the computer's help. They know about possible danger ahead of them and can prepare for it. Many times the computer information helps to save lives and property  . Sometimes the lives are those of fire fighters themselves.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him. Most definitely the most unforgettable classmate. Question: How long was it to when the student narrator arrived at the boarding school that the bully injured someone? Options:  A.

In 1880, his son John Church Hamilton commissioned Carl Conrads to sculpt a granite statue, now located in Central Park, New York City. One statue honoring Alexander Hamilton in Chicago was mired in controversy, at least concerning the surrounding architecture. Kate Sturges Buckingham (1858-1937), of the Buckingham Fountain family, commissioned the monument. Its impetus was that Treasury Secretary Hamilton \\"secured the nation's financial future and made it possible for her own family to make its fortune in grain elevators and banking. Consequently, John Angel was hired to model a figurative sculpture and the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen was to create a \\"colossal architectural setting\\" for it. The proposed 80-foot tall columned shelter was poorly received. By Ms. Buckingham's death in 1937, the sculpture's setting. location and design were uncertain. Conspiracy allegations surfaced, and the matter became mired in litigation. After the courts ordered the construction to be completed by 1953, the trustees hired architect Samuel A. Marx. The structure was completed, had structural problems, and was eventually demolished in 1993. The statue was gilded, and is still on display.

A 12-year-old girl was bitten around noon at Sailors Haven beach on Fire Island, a Long Island barrier island, and a 13-year-old boy was bitten at Atlantique beach, nearly 5 miles away, at around the same time, NJ.com reports. These are the first Long Island shark attacks since 1948, according to the Long Island Press. Neither child suffered life-threatening injuries, but all Fire Island beaches were closed until further notice as a precaution. The boy was out on his boogie board when he was bitten, authorities say. The bite left a tooth in the boy's leg, which was extracted and sent for analysis to find out what kind of shark it was. Witnesses believe it was a sandbar shark around 2 feet long. The girl says she was attacked when she was waist-deep in the water. The town of Islip has closed all its ocean-facing beaches. \\"We're seeing this as an opportunity to remind everyone the water is beautiful, it is magnificent here on the South Shore of Long Island, but the water is treacherous,\\" town supervisor Angie Carpenter tells NBC 4. \\"We need to be careful at all times.\\" Expand this summary.","output":"A long time ago, there were no shark attacks near Long Island, but recently, two kids got bitten by a shark just a few minutes apart from each other.

Luckily, neither of the kids got really hurt, but the people in charge have decided to close all the beaches there just to be extra safe. One of the kids was playing on his boogie board when the shark bit him and left a tooth stuck in his leg. Some grown-ups tried to figure out what kind of shark it was by looking at the tooth, and they think it was a small kind of shark called a sandbar shark.  The other kid, a girl, was bitten while standing in the water up to her waist.

She got a degree in secretarial science before entering Oakwood College, in Huntsville, Alabama. However, her aim was to become a singer at religious meetings. So after graduation she headed for Indiana University to study with the famous soprano Virginia Zeani.  Once, when Brown was troubled by self-doubt, Zeani said to her, \\"If you want to be the next Aretha Franklin, you need no more lessons,\\" Brown remembers her saying. \\"But if you want to be the best Verdian soprano this world has ever seen, you must work.\\"  Work she did. Three times she competed in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions . Three times she failed to make the final round in New York. Then, in 1997 at age 33, the age limit for sopranos to audition, she gave it one more try. She signed up at the last minute and didn't even practice, thinking, \\"All they could do was to tell me no, and that didn't hurt my feelings anymore.\\" She had the strength she needed to fall back on if she failed.  She won. But making it in New York was just the beginning. It took her three more years to become an understudy at the Met. But waiting in the wings was fine with her. Finally, her time came.

Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself. Brandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails, but he orders her to meet him again. After she complies, he takes her to an abandoned field. Instead of forcing himself upon her, Brandon starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her.

(March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In late 1944, the remnants of a platoon of German Panzergrenadiers from the GroÃdeutschland Division are caught in an ambush by American troops. In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right.As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about. Cpl. Baumann (Jason Flemyng) discovers a set of plans for the complex while Cpl. Ebert (Jack Davenport) finds a danger sign. Exploring further, Ebert comes to a mine shaft where he hears movement and a pile of sand nearly falls on top of him. Terrified, he is suddenly stabbed from behind. As he lays dying, a silhouetted figure resembling Kreutzmann walks up. Baumann hears his scream and packs up the papers to investigate when his torch dies. He lights a match and, seeing figures walking towards him, aims his weapon, but they turn out to be his comrades. When Lt. Krupp tries the torch, it turns on easily.Baumann thinks that the Americans are in the tunnels. The group then hears movement, which turns out to be Mirus. The soldiers turn on a rusty old generator, causing lights to turn on down in the tunnels. Lt. Krupp asks Mirus what's going on but Mirus is evasive. Before the questioning can go any further, the men hear machine gun fire coming from the bunker. When the men arrive, it appears that Neumann, Franke and Schenke had been firing at nothing. Lt. Krupp attempts to call headquarters, but the phone lines are dead. Convinced that the Americans have entered the tunnels, a game of cat and mouse develops. Stalked by shadowy figures, it becomes increasingly unclear where the men's fantasies end and the danger begins. Krupp agrees to send an expedition to secure the back entrance to the tunnels but on condition that if too much resistance is encountered they return. Mirus and Neumann are left behind in the bunker, while the remaining men split up: Krupp and Schenke in one group and Baumann, Franke and Neumann in the other. Before leaving, Schenke gives a Nazi salute, which none of the men in the other group return. Neumann stands guard while Mirus scorns the whole idea of trying to fight anymore. Mirus then claims that his son Werner, who died in Normandy, still talks to him and told him something about the tunnels.Down in the tunnels, Schenke and Krupp force their way into an ammunition storage room only to find nothing but shells. Arriving at the rear entrance, they find it is sealed but Schenke hypothesises that there's another way in. They continue searching and discover Ebert's body. The other group comes across the mine shaft and discover a mass grave. Following a voice, they find Kreutzmann, catatonic and repeatedly screaming \\"no\\". Kreutzmann begins babbling about someone being back. They hear a women's voice and try to get Kreutzmann out but Kreutzmann resists them. He breaks away, knocking Baumann out cold. He then hallucinates a soldier with his throat ripped out while two others take pictures and runs off. Lt. Krupp and Schenke explore a corridor when the lights begin to flicker. They hear movement and look, only to spin around a second later when they hear movement behind them and see a lamp swinging from side to side. They slowly back down the corridor to the back door of the tunnel complex. They hear loud banging as something tries to break into the tunnels. Kreutzmann comes rushing up the tunnel, screaming. Startled, Schenke and Kruppe open fire, killing him. The gunfire causes a collapse, burying Lt. Krupp under a pile of wooden beams. When Schenke realises it was Kreutzmann that they killed, he begins laughing hysterically.Back in the bunker, Neumann hears the gunfire and ventures down into the tunnels despite Mirus' protests. Alone, Mirus sees a shadowy figure and takes off in panic. As he flees, he hears pounding on each consecutive door he closes behind him, as if he is being pursued. Mirus leaves the bunker and falls outside into the barbed wire. He sees another dark figure approaching and in his panic to escape becomes more and more tangled in the barbed wire. Meanwhile, Neumann, who is searching through the tunnels, is caught by an increasingly paranoid Schenke, who puts a knife to his neck. Neumann regains his trust him and the two return to the artillery ammunition room and booby trap the room to prevent the shells from falling into the hands of the Americans, whom Schenke is sure are stalking through the tunnels. Heydrich, Baumann and Franke decide to blow the bunker door with a stick grenade and fight their way out. Schenke and Neumann hear the explosion and think that the Americans have set off a booby trap.Schenke lights a fuse to destroy the artillery ammo and the two of them move out. Heydrich, Baumann and Franke's plan to blast the door open fails so they go looking for another entrance. They run into Schenke and Neumann, who thinking that the three of them are Americans, open fire. A short firefight ensues in which Heydrich, Franke and Baumann use up their remaining STG-44 ammo they withdraw. Franke finally cracks and offers to surrender but it turns out that instead of Americans, Schenke is the one in the corridor. He looks rather deranged at this point. Neumann comes up and aims his Kar98K rifle at Heydrich, Baumann and Franke as Schenke basically announces his plan to execute the three of them. When Neumann refuses to execute the three of them Schneke pulls out his Luger and executes Franke. He then puts the gun to Neumann's head and threatens to kill him. Neumann is about to pull the trigger when the explosives go off, knocking everybody down. Heydrich, Baumann and Neumann make a run for it while Schenke wildly fires his pistol after them. The three men race through the tunnels but the main exit is blocked by wreckage. Heydrich pulls Neumann into the mine shaft to get away, but Baumann who is holding the rifle, stays behind and shoots at the helmeted figure approaching. To his amazement and terror the bullets seem to do nothing. He then begins hallucinating and fires a third shot before Heydrich pulls him away. Soon Schenke arrives, but the others have already erected a barricade over the mine shaft entrance.The men stumble across the mass grave again and then Schenke appears, destroying the barricade. Heydrich shoots Schenke in the chest with a flare gun and Schenke suddenly bursts into flames, screaming and reeling away. The three men begin whacking at the mass grave wall with entrenching tools, which break ground. Neumann breaks out and Heydrich is about to follow him when he's stabbed in the back by Schenke, who seems to have put his flames out, despite being badly burned. Baumann launches himself at Schenke and the two begin a fight, which seems even for a while, until Schenke throws Baumann back. Heydrich intervenes, only to get run through by Schenke. The distraction gives Baumann time to get away. Baumann breaks through a layer of soil made up of bones, which seems to try and suck him back into the earth, but is pulled out by Neumann. Baumann then rolls over and hurls a grenade down into the hole, which lands next to the gravely injured Schenke. Several seconds before it explodes, Schenke sees several silhouetted figures standing nearby.The movie then cuts to Neman and Baumann running away as the grenade explodes behind them, presumably killing Schenke. Neumann then checks out the bunker from the rear, and comes back to tell the wounded Baumann that it's safe. Baumann gives Neumann a handkerchief and tells him to go surrender. Neumann wants to stay but Baumann refuses, telling Neumann to leave. Neumann agrees to leave and on his way down the road finds Mirus' body tangled up in the barbed wire. He then sees American soldiers emerging from the woods and waves his handkerchief to get their attention. The film then cuts back to Baumann's memories which show the squad advancing across a sunny field only to find a bunch of deserters about to be executed. An officer hustles over Baumann to participate in the execution. One of the deserters is seen praying and Baumann misses his first shot before shooting the man twice. Quickly the firing squad moves in, with one soldier taking pictures with his camera and an officer finishing off the wounded with a pistol. A member of the firing squad is seen striking a pose while the picture-taking soldier snaps another shot. Baumann snaps out of remembering and staggers off towards the Americans.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Information:  - A sex organ or reproductive organ, primary sex organ, or primary sexual characteristic, is any anatomical part of the body in a complex organism that is involved in sexual reproduction and together constitute the reproductive system. The external and visible organs, in males and females, are the \\"primary sex organs\\" known as the genitals or genitalia. The internal organs are known as the \\"secondary sex organs\\" and are sometimes referred to as the \\"internal genitalia\\". The characteristics that begin to appear during puberty, such as, in humans, pubic hair on both sexes and facial hair on the male, are known as secondary sex characteristics.  - The vulva (plural \\"vulvae\\" or \\"vulvas\\") consists of the external female sex organs. The vulva includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, bulb of vestibule, vulval vestibule, urinary meatus, greater and lesser vestibular glands, and the vaginal opening. The urinary meatus is also included as it opens into the vulval vestibule. Other features of the vulva include: the pudendal cleft, sebaceous glands, the urogenital triangle (anterior part of the perineum), and pubic hair.  - In cell biology, mitosis is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cyclethe division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other.  - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm.  - In mammals, the vagina is a muscular and tubular part of the female genital tract, which in humans extends from the vulva to the cervix. The outer vaginal opening may be partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina. The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow, which occurs periodically as part of the menstrual cycle.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - The egg cell, or ovum, is the female reproductive cell (gamete) in oogamous organisms. The egg cell is typically not capable of active movement, and it is much larger (visible to the naked eye) than the motile sperm cells. When egg and sperm fuse, a diploid cell (the zygote) is formed, which rapidly grows into a new organism.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \\"Ethnologue\\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family.  - Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.  - An embryo is an early stage of development of a multicellular diploid eukaryotic organism. In general, in organisms that reproduce sexually, an embryo develops from a zygote, the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell. The zygote possesses half the DNA of each of its two parents. In plants, animals, and some protists, the zygote will begin to divide by mitosis to produce a multicellular organism. The result of this process is an embryo.  - The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle is required for the production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe. The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age, a point in time known as menarche. They may occasionally start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world and earlier in developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults (an average of 28 days). Menstruation stops occurring after menopause which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. The menstrual cycle is governed by hormonal changes. These changes can be altered by using hormonal birth control to prevent pregnancy. Each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in the ovary (ovarian cycle) or in the uterus (uterine cycle). The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle is divided into menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.  - Female () is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, that produces non-mobile ova (egg cells). Most female mammals, including female humans, have two X chromosomes.  - Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside female viviparous animals. It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals. Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time (multiple gestations).  - The female reproductive system (or female genital system) is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in human reproduction. The female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a fetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus and Fallopian tubes, and the ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the fetus. The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells). The external sex organs are also known as the \\"genitals\\" and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix.  - Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear at sexual maturity in animals and during puberty in humans, especially the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish the sexes of a species, but that, unlike the sex organs, are not directly part of the reproductive system. They are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which display fitness, giving an individual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and aggressive interactions. They are distinguished from the primary sex characteristics, the sex organs, which are directly necessary for sexual reproduction to occur.  - The uterine cavity is the inside of the uterus.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - Hippocrates of Kos (\\"Hippokráts\\"; 460  370 BC), also known as Hippocrates II, was a Greek physician of the Age of Pericles (Classical Greece), and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine. He is referred to as the \\"Father of Modern Medicine\\" in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine. This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated (theurgy and philosophy), thus establishing medicine as a profession.  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - The hymen is a membrane that surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening. It forms part of the vulva, or external genitalia, and is similar in structure to the vagina. The hymen does not seem to have a specific physiological function or purpose. In children, although a common appearance of the hymen is crescent-shaped, many shapes are possible. Normal variations of the hymen range from thin and stretchy to thick and somewhat rigid; or it may also be completely absent.  - In the anatomy of the female reproductive system, the cervical canal (also called the canal of the cervix, endocervical canal, cervical canal of uterus, or the cavity of cervix) is the spindle-shaped, flattened canal of the cervix, the neck of the uterus.  - The uterus ( from Latin \`\` uterus '' , plural uteri ) or womb is a major female hormone - responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals , including humans . One end , the cervix , opens into the vagina , while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes , ( uterine tubes ) depending on the species . It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation , usually developing completely in placental mammals such as humans and partially in marsupials such as kangaroos and opossums . Two uteri usually form initially in a female and usually male fetus , and in placental mammals they may partially or completely fuse into a single uterus depending on the species . In many species with two uteri , only one is functional . Humans and other higher primates such as chimpanzees , usually have a single completely fused uterus , although in some individuals the uteri may not have completely fused . Horses , on the other hand , have bipartite uteri . In English , the term uterus is used consistently within the medical and related professions , while the Germanic - derived term womb is more common in everyday usage . Most animals that lay eggs , such as birds and reptiles , including most ovoviviparous species , have an oviduct instead of a uterus . Note however , that recent research into the biology of the viviparous ( not merely ovoviviparous ) skink Trachylepis ivensi has revealed development of a very close analogue to eutherian mammalian placental development . In monotremes , mammals which lay eggs , namely the platypus and the echidnas , either the term uterus or oviduct is used to describe the same organ , but the egg does not develop a placenta within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and fertilization . Marsupials have two uteri , each of which connect to a lateral vagina and which both use a third , middle \`\` vagina '' which functions as the birth canal . Marsupial embryos form a choriovitelline \`\` placenta '' ( which can be thought of as something...  - The reproductive system or genital system is a system of sex organs within an organism which work together for the purpose of sexual reproduction. Many non-living substances such as fluids, hormones, and pheromones are also important accessories to the reproductive system. Unlike most organ systems, the sexes of differentiated species often have significant differences. These differences allow for a combination of genetic material between two individuals, which allows for the possibility of greater genetic fitness of the offspring.  - A classical language is a language with a literature that is \\"classical\\". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, \\"it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.\\"  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - A zygote (from Greek  \\"zygtos\\" \\"joined\\" or \\"yoked\\", from  \\"zygoun\\" \\"to join\\" or \\"to yoke\\"), is a eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization event between two gametes. The zygote's genome is a combination of the DNA in each gamete, and contains all of the genetic information necessary to form a new individual. In multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage. In single-celled organisms, the zygote can divide asexually by mitosis to produce identical offspring.  - Pubic hair is body hair found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans, located on and around the sex organs, the crotch, and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs, in the pubic region around the pubis bone.  - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet.  - The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.  - A fetus is a stage in the prenatal development of viviparous organisms. In human development, a fetus or foetus (plural fetuses or foetuses) is a prenatal human between the embryonic state and birth. The fetal stage of development tends to be taken as beginning at the gestational age of eleven weeks, i.e. nine weeks after fertilization. In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. The use of the term \\"fetus\\" generally implies that an embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as a human; this is the point usually taken to be the ninth week after fertilization. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final anatomical location.  - Childbirth, also known as labour and delivery, is the ending of a pregnancy by one or more babies leaving a woman's uterus. In 2015 there were about 135 million births globally. About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, while between 3 and 12% were born after 42 weeks. In the developed world most deliveries occur in hospital, while in the developing world most births take place at home with the support of a traditional birth attendant. The most common way of childbirth is a vaginal delivery. It involves three stages of labour: the shortening and opening of the cervix, descent and birth of the baby, and the pushing out of the placenta. The first stage typically lasts twelve to nineteen hours, the second stage twenty minutes to two hours, and the third stage five to thirty minutes. The first stage begins with crampy abdominal or back pains that last around half a minute and occur every ten to thirty minutes. The crampy pains become stronger and closer together over time. During the second stage pushing with contractions may occur. In the third stage delayed clamping of the umbilical cord is generally recommended. A number of methods can help with pain such as relaxation techniques, opioids, and spinal blocks. Most babies are born head first; however about 4% are born feet or buttock first, known as breech. During labour a woman can generally eat and move around as she likes, but pushing is not recommended during the first stage or during delivery of the head, and enemas are not recommended. While making a cut to the opening of the vagina is common, known as an episiotomy, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section. Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress in the baby, or breech position. This method of delivery can take longer to heal from. Each year complications from pregnancy and childbirth result in about 500,000 maternal deaths, 7 million women have serious long term problems, and 50...  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Birth, also known as parturition, is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's pouch.  - Protist is an informal term for any eukaryotic organism that is not an animal, plant or fungus. The protists do not form a natural group, or clade, but are often grouped together for convenience, like algae or invertebrates. In some systems of biological classification, such as the popular 5-kingdom scheme proposed by Robert Whittaker in 1969, the protists make up a kingdom called Protista, composed of \\"organisms which are unicellular or unicellular-colonial and which form no tissues.\\"  - The cervix or cervix uteri (\\"\\") is the lower part of the uterus in the human female reproductive system. In a non-pregnant woman, the cervix is usually 2 to 3 cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape. The narrow, central cervical canal runs along its entire length, connecting the uterine cavity and the lumen of the vagina. The opening into the uterus is called the internal os, and the opening into the vagina is called the external os. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. The cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of Hippocrates, over 2,000 years ago.  - Facial hair is a secondary sex characteristic of human males, referring to the growth of hair on or around the chin, jowls, and philtrum. Men typically start developing facial hair in the later years of puberty or adolescence, between seventeen and twenty years of age, and most do not finish developing a full adult beard until their early twenties or later. This varies, as boys may first develop facial hair between fourteen and sixteen years of age, and boys as young as eleven have been known to develop facial hair. Women are also capable of developing facial hair, especially after menopause, though typically significantly less than men.  - Sexual intercourse, or coitus or copulation, is principally the insertion and thrusting of the penis, usually when erect, into the vagina for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both. This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex. Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include anal sex (penetration of the anus by the penis), oral sex (penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the female genitalia), fingering (sexual penetration by the fingers), and penetration by use of a dildo (especially a strap-on dildo). These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more individuals and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure and commonly contribute to human bonding.    What is the relationship between 'uterus' and 'female reproductive system'? A:","output":"The uterus is a major component of the female reproductive system. It is a hormone-responsive, muscular, and hollow organ where a fertilized egg implants and develops into a fetus during pregnancy. The female reproductive system consists of both internal and external sex organs that function together for the purpose of sexual reproduction. The uterus, along with other internal organs such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix, forms the key parts of the female reproductive system responsible for producing gametes (ova or egg cells), facilitating fertilization, and supporting the growth and development of a new organism during gestation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little. I tried to hide this but my husband blurted out “You aren't crying, are you” like it was the dumbest thing to do and for the entire movie going audience to hear. Sheesh!

Article: Salmonella May Have Caused Massive Aztec Epidemic, Study Finds      Enlarge this image toggle caption Alexandre Meneghini/AP Alexandre Meneghini/AP      In 1545, people in the Mexican highlands starting dying in enormous numbers. People infected with the disease bled and vomited before they died. Many had red spots on their skin.      It was one of the most devastating epidemics in human history. The 1545 outbreak, and a second wave in 1576, killed an estimated 7 million to 17 million people and contributed to the destruction of the Aztec Empire.      But identifying the pathogen responsible for the carnage has been difficult for scientists because infectious diseases leave behind very little archaeological evidence.      \\"There have been different schools of thought on what this disease was. Could it have been plague? Could it have been typhoid fever? Could it have been a litany of other diseases?\\" says Kirsten Bos, a molecular paleopathologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, and an author of a new study published Monday in Nature Ecology and Evolution.      The study analyzes DNA from the teeth of 10 people who died during the epidemic and pinpoints a possible culprit: a type of salmonella that causes a deadly fever.      A new algorithm allowed Bos and her team to identify fragments of ancient salmonella DNA with extreme specificity.      \\"It was an analytical technique that was really the game-changer for us,\\" Bos explains. While scientists have been able to extract ancient DNA from bones and other tissue, until recently it was impossible to compare that extracted DNA to a wide variety of potential matches.      But a new computer program called MALT allowed them to do just that. \\"The major advancement was this algorithm,\\" Bos says. \\"It offers a method of analyzing many, many, many small DNA fragments that we get, and actually identifying, by species name, the bacteria that are represented.\\"      Bos and her team used MALT to match up the DNA fragments extracted from teeth of epidemic victims with a database of known pathogens. The program didn't entire save them from mind-numbing work — at one point PhD student and study author Ashild Vagene had to go through the results of the program by hand.      In the end, they found evidence of the deadly Salmonella enterica Paratyphi C bacteria.      The study does not pinpoint the source of the bacteria, which is an area of great interest for biologists and archaeologists alike. The authors note that many epidemics of the period are believed to originate with European invaders who arrived in the region in the early part of the 16th century, but the new research doesn't present biological evidence for or against that.      A previous study suggested the pathogen responsible for the epidemic originated in Mexico, and that the epidemic was exacerbated by drought. And, Bos notes, \\"the Europeans who were observing the symptoms didn't know what it was, and Europeans got it as well,\\" which suggests it wasn't a disease endemic to Europe.      But even if Europeans did not introduce the pathogen, they may still be responsible for its profound deadliness among indigenous people. \\"We know that Europeans very much changed the landscape once they entered the new world,\\" Bos says. \\"They introduced new livestock, [and] there was lots of social disruption among the indigenous population which would have increased their susceptibility to infectious disease.\\" ||||| Bettmann/Getty      One of the worst epidemics in human history, a sixteenth-century pestilence that devastated Mexico’s native population, may have been caused by a deadly form of salmonella from Europe, a pair of studies suggest.      In one study, researchers say they have recovered DNA of the stomach bacterium from burials in Mexico linked to a 1540s epidemic that killed up to 80% of the country's native inhabitants. The team reports its findings in a preprint posted on the bioRxiv server on 8 February1.      This is potentially the first genetic evidence of the pathogen that caused the massive decline in native populations after European colonization, says Hannes Schroeder, an ancient-DNA researcher at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen who was not involved in the work. “It’s a super-cool study.”      Dead bodies and ditches      In 1519, when forces led by Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortés arrived in Mexico, the native population was estimated at about 25 million. A century later, after a Spanish victory and a series of epidemics, numbers had plunged to around 1 million.      The largest of these disease outbreaks were known as cocoliztli (from the word for ‘pestilence’ in Nahuatl, the Aztec language). Two major cocoliztli, beginning in 1545 and 1576, killed an estimated 7 million to 18 million people living in Mexico’s highland regions.      “In the cities and large towns, big ditches were dug, and from morning to sunset the priests did nothing else but carry the dead bodies and throw them into the ditches,” noted a Franciscan historian who witnessed the 1576 outbreak.      There has been little consensus on the cause of cocoliztli — although measles, smallpox and typhus have all been mooted. In 2002, researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City proposed that a viral haemorrhagic fever, exacerbated by a catastrophic drought, was behind the carnage2. They compared the magnitude of the 1545 outbreak to that of the Black Death in fourteenth-century Europe.      Bacterial genomics      In an attempt to settle the question, a team led by evolutionary geneticist Johannes Krause at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, extracted and sequenced DNA from the teeth of 29 people buried in the Oaxacan highlands of southern Mexico. All but five were linked to a cocoliztli that researchers think ran from 1545 to 1550.      Ancient bacterial DNA recovered from several of the people matched that of Salmonella, based on comparisons with a database of more than 2,700 modern bacterial genomes.      Further sequencing of short, damaged DNA fragments from the remains allowed the team to reconstruct two genomes of a Salmonella enterica strain known as Paratyphi C. Today, this bacterium causes enteric fever, a typhus-like illness, that occurs mostly in developing countries. If left untreated, it kills 10–15% of infected people.      It’s perfectly reasonable that the bacterium could have caused this epidemic, says Schroeder. “They make a really good case.” But María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM, isn't convinced. She notes that some people suggest that a virus caused the cocoliztli, and that wouldn't have been picked up by the team’s method.      The question of origin      Krause and his colleagues’ proposal is helped by another study posted on bioRxiv last week, which raises the possibility that Salmonella Paratyphi C arrived in Mexico from Europe3.      A team led by Mark Achtman, a microbiologist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK, collected and sequenced the genome of the bacterial strain from the remains of a young woman buried around 1200 in a cemetery in Trondheim, Norway. It is the earliest evidence for the now-rare Salmonella strain, and proof that it was circulating in Europe, according to the study. (Both teams declined to comment on their research because their papers have been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.)      “Really, what we’d like to do is look at both strains together,” says Hendrik Poinar, an evolutionary biologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. And if more ancient genomes can be collected from Europe and the Americas, it should be possible to find out more conclusively whether deadly pathogens such as Salmonella arrived in the New World from Europe.      The existence of Salmonella Paratyphi C in Norway 300 years before it appeared in Mexico doesn’t prove that Europeans spread enteric fever to native Mexicans, says Schroeder, but that hypothesis is reasonable. A small percentage of people infected with Salmonella Paratyphi C carry the bacterium without falling ill, so apparently healthy Spaniards could have infected Mexicans who lacked natural resistance.      Paratyphi C is transmitted through faecal material, and a collapse of social order during the Spanish conquest might have led to the poor sanitary conditions that are ripe for Salmonella spread, Krause and his team note in the paper.      Krause’s study offers a blueprint for identifying the pathogens behind ancient outbreaks, says Schroeder. His own team plans to look for ancient pathogens in Caribbean burial sites that seem to be linked to catastrophic outbreaks, and that were established after the Europeans arrived. “The idea that some of them might have been caused by Salmonella is now a distinct possibility,” he says. ||||| 1.

Salmonella enterica genomes from victims of a major 16th century epidemic in Mexico. Nature Ecology and Evolution. In 1545, disaster struck Mexico's Aztec nation when people started coming down with high fevers and headaches, bleeding from the eyes, mouth and nose. Death generally followed in three or four days.      Within five years, as many as 15 million people—an estimated 80 percent of the population—were wiped out in an epidemic the locals named \\"cocoliztli\\".      The word means \\"pestilence\\" in the Aztec Nahuatl language. Its cause, however, has been in question for nearly 500 years.      On Monday, scientists swept aside smallpox, measles, mumps, and influenza as likely suspects, fingering a typhoid-like \\"enteric fever\\" for which they found DNA evidence on the teeth of long-dead victims.      \\"The 1545-50 cocoliztli was one of many epidemics to affect Mexico after the arrival of Europeans, but was specifically the second of three epidemics that were most devastating and led to the largest number of human losses,\\" said Ashild Vagene of the University of Tuebingen in Germany.      \\"The cause of this epidemic has been debated for over a century by historians and now we are able to provide direct evidence through the use of ancient DNA to contribute to a longstanding historical question,\\" she told AFP.      Vagene co-authored a study published in the science journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.      The cocoliztli outbreak is considered one of the deadliest epidemics in human history, approaching the \\"Black Death\\" bubonic plague that felled some 25 million people in western Europe in the 14th century—about half the regional population.      Excavated structure at the northern edge of the Grand Plaza at Teposcolula-Yucundaa. Architectural investigations of the Grand Plaza resulted in the unexpected discovery of a large epidemic cemetery associated with the 1545-1550 cocoliztli epidemic. The cemetery was found to contain numerous mass burials, attesting to the catastrophic nature of the epidemic. Credit: Christina Warinner. The Teposcolula-Yucundaa Archaeological Project.      European colonisers spread disease as they ventured into the New World, bringing germs that local populations had never encountered, and therefore had no immunity against.      The 1545 cocoliztli pestilence in what is today Mexico and part of Guatemala came just two decades after a smallpox epidemic killed an estimated 5-8 million people in the immediate wake of the Spanish arrival.      'Strong candidate'      A second cocoliztli outbreak from 1576 to 1578 killed half the remaining population.      \\"In the cities and large towns, big ditches were dug, and from morning to sunset the priests did nothing else but carry the dead bodies and throw them into the ditches,\\" is how Franciscan historian Fray Juan de Torquemada is cited as chronicling the period.      Even at the time, physicians said the symptoms did not match those of better-known diseases such as measles and malaria.      On Monday, scientists said they have likely unmasked the culprit.      Analysing DNA extracted from 29 skeletons buried in a cocoliztli cemetery, they found traces of the salmonella enterica bacterium, of the Paratyphi C variety.      Åshild J. Vågene conducting lab work at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. Credit: Elizabeth Nelson      It is known to cause enteric fever, of which typhoid is an example. The Mexican subtype rarely causes human infection today.      Many salmonella strains spread via infected food or water, and may have travelled to Mexico with domesticated animals brought by the Spanish, the research team said.      Salmonella enterica is known to have been present in Europe in the Middle Ages.      \\"We tested for all bacterial pathogens and DNA viruses for which genomic data is available,\\" and salmonella enterica was the only germ detected, co-author Alexander Herbig, also from Tuebingen University, told AFP.      It is possible, however, that some pathogens were either undetectable, or completely unknown.      \\"We cannot say with certainty that S. enterica was the cause of the cocoliztli epidemic,\\" said team member Kirsten Bos.      \\"We do believe that it should be considered a strong candidate.\\"      Explore further: Epidemic outbreaks caused by environment, not evolution      More information: Åshild J.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical","output":"To analyze the sentiment of the given sentence \\"is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical,\\" I will perform sentiment analysis step-by-step: 1. Preprocessing:  First, I will check for any spelling errors, abbreviations, or slang in the sentence and correct or standardize them. In this case, the sentence seems to be well-structured and requires no changes. 2. Tokenizing: Next, I will break down the sentence into individual words (tokens) to analyze their sentiment. Tokens: [\\"is\\", \\"virtually\\", \\"without\\", \\"context\\", \\"--\\", \\"journalistic\\", \\"or\\", \\"historical\\"] 3. Removing stopwords: Now, I will remove any common words that do not contribute to the sentiment of the sentence (stopwords). In this case, stopwords include \\"is\\" and \\"or\\". Relevant tokens: [\\"virtually\\", \\"without\\", \\"context\\", \\"journalistic\\", \\"historical\\"] 4. Sentiment score assignment: I will assign sentiment scores to the relevant tokens based on sentiment dictionaries, which contain positive and negative word scores. If the word is not found in any of the dictionaries, it will be considered neutral. \\"virtually\\" - Neutral (0) \\"without\\" - Negative (-1) \\"context\\" - Neutral (0) \\"journalistic\\" - Neutral (0) \\"historical\\" - Neutral (0) 5. Calculate overall sentiment: Now, I will calculate the overall sentiment of the sentence by adding the sentiment scores together. Total sentiment score: -1 6. Converting sentiment score to sentiment: Finally, I will convert the sentiment score to a sentiment category by the following rules: Negative sentiment: score < 0 Neutral sentiment: score = 0 Positive sentiment: score > 0 Since the sentiment score is -1, the sentiment of the sentence is negative.

(CNN) -- Actor Robert Blake accused CNN's Piers Morgan of calling him a liar in a combative, profanity-laced interview that was more remarkable for its tone than revelations surrounding his acquittal in the 2001 murder of his wife. Blake, 78, said he agreed to appear on the show Wednesday to promote his self-published memoir \\"Tales Of A Rascal,\\" telling Morgan that the book was not about his late wife, Bonnie Lee Bakley, or their relationship. \\"I made a deal to come here and talk about anybody from the book,\\" Blake said after Morgan asked about his feelings about the case. \\"But one day somebody opened the paper and saw that Bonnie just married Robert Blake and where does","output":"that leave me?\\" he continued, his voice saturated with indignation as he challenged Morgan's journalistic integrity for delving into the case when it was explicitly not the focus of their conversation. As Blake's anger swelled and the conversation grew increasingly confrontational, it became clear that the interview was quickly devolving into an uncomfortable spectacle, a far cry from the promotional opportunity he originally envisioned for his memoir. Morgan, unflinching in his journalistic pursuit, pressed on with questions about the case, seemingly disregarding Blake's original agreement to appear on the show, further intensifying the clash between the actor and the host."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D.  But I can use this background: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity.  What is an answer for this question: If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, are they closer or farther? Answer:","output":"If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, it means that they are closer to each other. This is due to the fact that both charges are negative, and according to Coulomb's law, like charges repel each other. The electric potential energy between two charges in this case can be described by the formula: U = k * |qA * qB| / r where U is the potential energy, k is Coulomb's constant, |qA * qB| represents the product of the magnitudes of the charges A and B, and r is the distance between the centers of the charges. As the distance (r) between the two charges decreases, the potential energy (U) increases, indicating that they are in a state of higher potential energy when they are closer to each other. The repulsive force between the two negative charges is stronger when they are closer together, causing increased potential energy. This is analogous to holding two strong magnets with the same poles facing each other - as you try to push them closer together, the repulsive force (and the potential energy) between them increases. Electric charges tend to move spontaneously from a position of higher potential energy to a position of lower potential energy, similar to water falling over a dam due to the force of gravity. In the case of the electric charges, they would naturally move farther away from each other to reduce the potential energy, following the path of least resistance through the electric fields C and D mentioned in the scenario. As the distance between charges A and B increases, their potential energy will decrease, reaching a more stable state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Koch, the former three-term mayor of New York City, was hospitalized on Tuesday for anemia, said George Arzt, his former press secretary and longtime friend. Mr. Koch, who is 87 and served as mayor for 12 years, starting in 1978, had been “extraordinarily weak” in recent weeks, Mr. Arzt said by phone. “He used to eat like a horse, and now he just pushes the food around his plate,” Mr. Arzt said. He said he expected Mr. Koch to be released from the hospital within a few days. Mr. Koch, who previously had a stroke and a heart attack, as well as quadruple bypass surgery, has continued to have a political presence in recent years. Two years ago, he began a campaign against corruption and mismanagement in Albany. Last year, he endorsed Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, in her bid for mayor.

Some beauty salons and plastic surgeons offer treatments for cellulite that use lasers and other mechanical devices.  There are downsides to these methods. They are often expensive, they need to be repeated regularly, they have to be done by a trained professional and can be painful. One example: Cellulaze is a procedure approved by the FDA for cellulite. A small laser is inserted under the skin to break down the cellulite’s structure. Research carefully any such interventions and check into the licensing and ratings of the salon performing the functions, as well as the credentials and training of the person administering it. Laser toning and cold-laser massage are also techniques that are said to reduce the appearance of cellulite. The tri-active laser was approved by the FDA and claims to temporarily reduce cellulite’s appearance. Fillers are sometimes used to treat cellulite dimples. Many products advertise that they can help improve cellulite. Not all are that successful, but you could give them a try.  You might find temporary help from ingredients that dilate blood and lymph vessels. Black pepper, green tea, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and ginkgo fall into this category, and some anti-cellulite creams contain them. Ointments containing forskolin (which comes from the herb coleus forskohlii) were found in one study to help women lose excess skin from their thighs. Skin firming cream can help build up collagen and diminish wrinkles. Some cellulite creams contain retinol, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin C. Major brands like Lancome, L’Oreal, and Nivea offer gels and lotions that are said to firm up the skin. Not only do massages feel great, but they are also known to reduce the look of unsightly cellulite dimples.  Use a body brush with boar or just stiff bristles in a circular motion while you take a shower. Or use a hand-held massagers. Apply the massage head to the areas with cellulite. Add a skin firming serum, body lotion or anti-cellulite gel before you apply the massaging motions. Cellulite is caused by fat deposits that push through the skin’s connective tissue, usually in the buttocks and thighs.  Massaging the skin stimulates the lymphatic system that lies right underneath the skin’s surface. This circulates toxins and causes the body to release them more quickly. Add a few drops of olive and juniper oil to the skin before massaging it.

Review: The story is somewhat stilted, what with the main character's sudden reversals of fortune, but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis's portrayals of Philip Carey, the naïve obsessed lover and Mildred Rogers, the unworthy object of his affections, raise this film considerably above standard melodrama. Sensitive, cultured Philip, who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for Mildred is not unlike a character Howard was to play a few years later--Ashley Wilkes, the Southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough Reconstruction era. Philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before Mildred enters the picturehe doesn't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he'll never make it as a painter. It is perhaps this passivity, these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish Cockney waitress for as long as he does. Although Leslie Howard is memorable, today \\"Of Human Bondage\\" is mainly thought of as a Bette Davis picture, perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight Jack Warner to get the part of Mildred, and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy. Mildred may have a grating voice, but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel, making it somewhat understandable why Philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did. Although man eating Mildred may at times seem one dimensional, she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her. One may also think she is on to something when she accuses Philip of looking down on her for not being \\"fine\\" enough. (The scene in which Philip and Norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this). Most of the supporting characters are also effective, particularly Norah the sensible romance writer who loves Philip but knows she can never compete with Mildred and Sally who has Mildred's beauty and Norah's decency and emerges as the deserving woman Philip is rewarded with in the end. The only character I found hollow was Sally's eccentric, ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era. A classic that deserves it reputation.

Movie title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament. The deciding moment comes when he is watching an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South... Answer:","output":"Jack Ruby's occupation was that of a nightclub owner. He owned and operated various establishments including the Carousel Club and the Vegas Club in Dallas, Texas. Ruby became infamous for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, the individual accused of assassinating President John F. Kennedy. Ruby shot Oswald while he was in police custody, fueling a wide range of conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The movie title you mentioned, \\"Executive Action,\\" is a 1973 American conspiracy thriller film that centers around a fictional account of the Kennedy assassination. The movie suggests that shadowy industrial, political, and former US intelligence figures craft a plan to assassinate President Kennedy due to their dissatisfaction with his administration. The film explores the planning and execution of this assassination plot, while painting a dark and ominous picture of the potential forces at play behind the tragic event. The plot of the movie involves a group of powerful and influential individuals coming together to discuss their growing discontent with President Kennedy's policies and actions. Persuading Harold Ferguson, a powerful oil magnate, to support their plans for an assassination becomes their focus. James Farrington, a black ops specialist, presents the concept of \\"executive action\\" as a means of carrying out the assassination. As the conspirators develop and refine their plan, they conduct target practice in a desert and make arrangements to ensure the operation's success. Ferguson's increasing concern over Kennedy's liberal direction, particularly regarding civil rights and nuclear disarmament, leads to his eventual support for the ominous plan. Ultimately, \\"Executive Action\\" is a fictional film that tells a captivating and chilling story about the potential conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination. Investing in a film proposal will depend on various factors such as the quality of the script, the experience and talent of the cast and crew, the target audience, and the marketability of the film. Analyzing these elements and assessing the potential return on investment can help determine if it's worth investing in this specific film proposal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We're given this equation: 0 = 2 * o - 89 + 103 Our job is to find out what value of \\"o\\" will make the equation true. That's like solving a little puzzle! 1. First, let's simplify the equation by adding the numbers together. We have -89 and +103. When you add them together: -89 + 103 = 14. Now the equation looks like this: 0 = 2 * o + 14 2. Now, we need to get \\"o\\" by itself. To do this, we'll need to move everything else to the other side of the equation. Let's start by getting rid of the \\"+14.\\" Since it's adding 14, to move it to the other side, we'll subtract 14. So we'll have: 0 - 14 = 2 * o (which is the same as -14 = 2 * o) 3. Now, we have -14 = 2 * o. We want to find out what \\"o\\" is, so we need to get rid of the \\"2 *\\" or, in simpler terms, divide both sides of the equation by 2. That gives us: -14 ÷ 2 = o 4. Finally, doing the division, we find out our answer: -7 = o So, our solution for the equation is o = -7! That means if you put -7 for o in our original equation, it will be true: 0 = 2 * (-7) - 89 + 103. When you do the math for that, it does equal 0, and that's how we solve it!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Gods and Generals Context: The film centers on the life of Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, the God-fearing and militarily brilliant yet eccentric Confederate general, from the outbreak of the American Civil War until its halfway point when Jackson, while on a night ride with his staff to plan the next day's battle, is accidentally shot by his own soldiers in May 1863 while commanding at the Battle of Chancellorsville. It also follows Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Winfield Scott Hancock. Chamberlain is a Maine college professor who is appointed a Lieutenant Colonel and becomes second-in-command of the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The film prominently features the Battles of Bull Run (1st Manassas), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The film's original running time clocked in at nearly 6 hours (much like the original running time of Gettysburg). The longer version featured the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) as well as an entire plot following the American actor and future assassin John Wilkes Booth and his colleague Henry Harrison (from Gettysburg). This film opens with Colonel Robert E. Lee's resignation from the Union Army, accompanied by the perspectives of various politicians, teachers, and soldiers as the south secedes from the Union and both sides prepare for war. Major Jackson, who is a professor at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington at the outset of the war, leaves his family behind to do battle at Manassas Junction. Jackson is asked by a retreating General Barnard Bee for assistance against the Federal army who is pursuing them after a brief stand on Matthews Hill. In rallying his shaken troops, Bee launches the name of Stonewall into history and the Confederates rout the Federals at Henry House Hill. Jackson maintains steadfast discipline in his ranks during the battle despite suffering a wound to his left hand from a spent ball. Meanwhile, Chamberlain makes his transition from teacher to military officer and practices drilling his soldiers, and is taught military tactics by Col. Adelbert Ames, the... Answer:","output":"The story \\"Gods and Generals\\" is decidedly emphatic of Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and Winfield Scott Hancock.  The film focuses primarily on the life and military career of Confederate General Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, starting from the outbreak of the American Civil War until his accidental death at the hands of his own soldiers during the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863. His strong faith, military prowess, and eccentricities are highlighted in the film, showing his dedication to the Confederate cause and his determination to maintain discipline and order in his ranks. Additionally, the story also emphasizes Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a college professor from Maine who becomes a Lieutenant Colonel and second-in-command of the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. His journey from academia to being a military leader is portrayed through his evolution as a character, his dedication to learning, and implementing military tactics in the field. Chamberlain's character also showcases the struggles faced by people who had non-military backgrounds and were thrust into the violence and tribulations of war. Lastly, Winfield Scott Hancock, another major character in the movie, is a prominent Union General whose role in the story serves as a comparison to Jackson and Chamberlain. His military leadership and presence in the film create a well-rounded perspective, highlighting the various viewpoints and levels of experience present on both sides of the Civil War. By focusing on these three characters - Jackson, Chamberlain, and Hancock - \\"Gods and Generals\\" emphasizes their individual experiences, contributions, and perspectives in the context of the Civil War, making the story decidedly emphatic of these key historical figures. Through their stories, the film explores critical battles such as the Battles of Bull Run (1st Manassas), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, presenting an in-depth look at the lives of the people involved and the strategies that shaped these significant events in American history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Importance of the Context: Understanding the historical and contextual significance of his discovery is essential. Notably, J.J. Thomson's discovery was at a time when the structure of atoms was a major subject of scientific exploration.  2. Experimentation: In 1897, Thomson conducted his famous cathode ray experiments. He passed electricity through gases at low pressure and observed that the cathode rays (streams of particles) produced were deflected by electric and magnetic fields. 3. Hypothesis and Further Experiments: He hypothesized that these rays were composed of negatively charged particles that originated from within atoms. To test his hypothesis, Thomson calculated the charge-to-mass ratio of the particles through a series of experiments.  4. Analysis and Discovery: Based on his experiments, Thomson suggested that atoms were divisible and they contained tiny, negatively charged particles, which he named \\"corpuscles,\\" later to become known as electrons.  5. Validation and Further Impact: This contradicted the prevailing notion that atoms were indivisible and fundamental units. Thomson's work paved the way for the development of the \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom and ultimately, to our modern understanding of atomic structure. So, while J.J. Thomson didn't \\"discover\\" an atom per se, his pioneering work led to the discovery of a key component of the atom - the electron."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When having a weak immune system, it does not directly alter the steps of the virus' process of infecting the cells. However, the weakened immune system may affect the body's overall response to the viral infection, potentially causing more severe symptoms and possibly a prolonged recovery time. The immune system plays a crucial role in detecting and neutralizing the virus; therefore, a weakened immune system would be less effective in controlling the viral replication and spread within the body.

Write an article based on this \\"Officials in China say they're working hard to tackle the country's smog problem.\\"","output":"Title: China's Determination in Tackling Its Smog Problem: A Comprehensive Overview Introduction: China has been experiencing a considerable rise in air pollution over the years, causing a significant increase in smog across the country. The severity of this problem has led to detrimental impacts on the environment, health, and overall quality of life for millions of citizens. Recognizing the magnitude of this issue, Chinese officials have publicly announced their commitment to finding effective solutions and implementing necessary measures to mitigate the problem. In this article, we will explore the nature of China's smog problem, its causes, the efforts made by the government, and the potential outcomes of these actions. Step 1: Understanding the Smog Problem To tackle the smog issue, it's essential first to understand its composition, causes, and effects. Smog is a type of air pollution caused by a mixture of gases and particulate matter (PM), primarily originating from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and coal combustion. When exposed to sunlight, these pollutants react with each other, creating a thick, harmful haze that engulfs many Chinese cities, particularly during winter months. The problem is further exacerbated by China's rapid industrialization and urbanization, thus making air quality a pressing concern. Step 2: Examining the Causes China's smog problem arises from multiple sources, including the burning of coal for power, emissions from vehicles and industrial processes, and the increased demand for energy. The massive rise in industrial production, paired with the country's reliance on coal as its primary energy source, has contributed significantly to the increase of airborne pollutants. Furthermore, vehicle emissions, particularly those from diesel-fueled engines, contribute considerably to the problem, leading to dangerous levels of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides circulating in the air. Step 3: Identifying Government Efforts Chinese officials have taken notice of the growing smog problem and are implementing various strategies to combat it. Some of these measures include: 1. Promoting cleaner energy alternatives: China's government has been working toward transitioning to cleaner energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, and solar power, as a way of reducing emissions from power generation. 2. Tightening vehicle emission standards: The Chinese government has also implemented stricter vehicle emissions standards, aiming to reduce the number of high-polluting cars on the roads. 3. Shutting down or relocating highly polluting industries: Officials have closed or relocated hundreds of factories that emit significant pollutants, aiming to improve air quality in heavily industrialized areas. 4. Encouraging public transportation use: By investing in public transportation and providing incentives for its use, China is working to decrease the number of vehicles on the roads, ultimately reducing emissions. Step 4: Assessing the Potential Outcomes Although it will take time for these efforts to manifest into noticeable improvements in air quality, there is reason to be optimistic. Countries that have previously experienced severe smog problems, such as the United Kingdom during the Great Smog of 1952, have managed to curb pollution levels through effective policies and regulations. As China continues to invest in cleaner technologies and enforce stricter regulations, it is likely that the country will see a gradual decline in its air pollution levels. This will undoubtedly lead to significant improvements in public health and quality of life for its citizens. Conclusion: China's smog problem cannot be resolved overnight. However, as Chinese officials continue to work on implementing effective strategies, there is hope that the country will gradually find its way toward cleaner air and better living conditions. Through collaborative efforts between government bodies, industry, and the public, it is possible to make significant strides toward a healthier, more sustainable future for China and its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: To prevent cookies from sticking to a baking pan, you can OPT:  a). Spray with confectioners sugar.  b). Spray with pam or use grease.","output":"Option b) Spray with Pam or use grease is the correct method to prevent cookies from sticking to a baking pan. Here's a detailed explanation of how to do this: 1. Preheat your oven: Before starting, preheat your oven to the recommended temperature mentioned in your cookie recipe. This ensures even cooking and less chance of the cookies sticking to the baking pan. 2. Choose the appropriate fat: Select a suitable fat for greasing the baking pan. This can be a non-stick cooking spray like Pam, butter, shortening, or vegetable oil. Note that using butter will give the cookies a richer taste while using a non-stick cooking spray or shortening provides a more neutral taste. 3. Grease the baking pan: If you're using a non-stick cooking spray, shake the can well and spray a thin, even layer on the baking pan about 10-12 inches away from the surface. Make sure you cover the entire pan, including corners and edges. If you prefer using butter, shortening, or vegetable oil, you can either use a pastry brush to spread the fat evenly onto the pan or wrap a small piece of wax paper or plastic around your fingers and rub the fat directly onto the surface of the baking pan. 4. Chill the cookies (optional): To minimize spreading, you can refrigerate the formed cookie dough on the greased baking pan for about 15-30 minutes. This will make the fat more solid, providing a barrier to the cookies sticking to the pan during baking. 5. Properly space the cookies: When placing the cookies onto the greased baking pan, ensure that there is enough space between them. This helps the heat circulate evenly and prevents the cookies from sticking together or to the pan. 6. Bake the cookies: Put the baking pan into the preheated oven and bake the cookies according to the recipe's instructions. Keep an eye on them and remove them from the oven once they are done. 7. Cool the cookies: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking pan for about 5 to 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack or plate to finish cooling. It is essential to let the cookies cool slightly before removing them, as they are more prone to breaking when hot. 8. Cleaning and storing the baking pan: After the cookies have cooled and been transferred, clean the baking pan with warm soapy water and a sponge. Dry it thoroughly before storing it away. By following these steps to grease the baking pan, you will successfully prevent cookies from sticking to the pan during baking. Using confectioners sugar (option a) might add a sweet and slightly caramelized outer layer to the cookies but wouldn't provide a barrier to prevent sticking as effectively as greasing the pan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The US was part of the group that liked blue toys (that group was called Capitalists), and Vietnam had some friends who liked red toys (that group was called Communists). The US was worried that if more kids started playing with red toys, then the blue toys group would have fewer friends.

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of women who own their own businesses, as well as those who are seeking management positions in various sectors. This trend has persisted despite the challenges presented by economic crises, which have had a noticeable impact on the global job market and business landscape. There are several factors contributing to this rise in female entrepreneurship and leadership. Firstly, there is an overall increase in awareness and support for gender equality in the workplace, particularly in terms of access to opportunities and resources. This has been facilitated by legislative changes, industry policies, and the efforts of organizations and individuals advocating for greater gender diversity in leadership roles. Furthermore, women are becoming more educated and skilled, thus increasing their likelihood of being qualified for higher management positions. Many women are now pursuing advanced degrees in fields related to business and management, helping them develop the skills and expertise necessary to succeed in these roles. Another factor is the growing number of female role models in business. As more women take on leadership roles in various sectors, they demonstrate the success that can be achieved, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. This contributes to a normalized view of women in leadership, encouraging even more women to pursue such opportunities. Moreover, with the advancements in technology, more women are finding it easier to start their own businesses, as many industries have become more accessible through platforms such as e-commerce, online marketing, and remote working arrangements. This has led to an increase in female entrepreneurs, who can now pursue their business goals and maintain a better balance between work and personal life. In addition, many women are attracted to entrepreneurship and management positions as a way to gain more control over their careers and achieve a better work-life balance. The flexibility offered by these roles allows women to prioritize both personal and professional goals, leading them to pursue these opportunities despite any economic uncertainties. Finally, economic crises may actually provide unique opportunities for women who are willing to take risks and innovate during challenging times. As traditional industries and businesses struggle, there could be room for enterprising women to step in and make a mark with innovative products, services, or business models. In conclusion, the number of women owning their businesses and seeking management positions in other places has been on the rise, even in the face of economic crises. This is mainly attributable to increased support for gender equality, better education and skills, successful female role models, advancements in technology, and the desire for more control and flexibility in their careers.

This includes goggles to protect our eyes, gloves for our hands, and some long clothes to cover our arms and legs. Muriatic acid can be a bit mean to our skin, so we need to stay safe. Now it's time for a grown-up to carefully mix the muriatic acid and water. They will take 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of muriatic acid and add it to 1 gallon of water in a big bucket. Make sure you don't do this part by yourself; we want to stay safe and let a grown-up handle the strong chemicals! Then, you can use an acid brush, which is a special brush for cleaning tiles, to spread the solution onto the tiles inside the pool. The grown-up might need some help, so remember to wear your superhero outfit and be extra careful! After the tiles get all covered in the cleaning solution, they will start to get shiny and clean again. But we can't leave the acid in the pool! We need to add something called soda ash to make it safe, which will change the acid solution into a neutral one. Soda ash is like a superhero that helps calm the acid down and make it safe. Finally, we need to use a pump to get the neutralized acid out of the pool. This is like using a big vacuum cleaner that sucks up all the water and the acid solution. The grown-up will help you with this part too. Once it's all cleaned up, you can put water back in the pool, and it will be shiny and ready for more swimming fun! And that's how we safely clean your pool tiles with muriatic acid! Remember to always have a grown-up with you and wear your superhero outfit to stay safe while helping clean the pool. Happy swimming!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

After that, we will be left with: 131 * p So now our equation looks like this: 131 * p + 12 = 125 * p Now, to find \\"p\\", we need to get all the \\"p\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side of the equation. Let's move the 125 * p to the other side. Since it's positive, it will become negative when we move it: 131 * p - 125 * p = -12 Now, on the left side, we have: (131 - 125) * p = -12 This is like having 131 apples and then taking away 125 apples. We will be left with: 6 * p = -12 Now, to find \\"p\\", we have to divide both sides of the equation by 6: p = -12 / 6 After dividing, we will find that: p = -2 So there you have it!

Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump.  Gary is a high school student examining two cells under a microscope for his biology class. In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another.  Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient? The answer to this question is:","output":"Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient. Step-by-step justification: 1. In Cell X, substances are spreading apart and becoming less concentrated. This is an example of diffusion, which is the movement of substances down the concentration gradient. 2. In Cell Y, substances are congregating and moving into close proximity to one another. This is the opposite of diffusion, which means substances must move up the concentration gradient. 3. When substances move from low concentration to high concentration - up the concentration gradient - this requires an input of energy, such as that provided by ATP molecules. 4. In the context of the question, Cell Y's observed behavior demonstrates substances moving up the concentration gradient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But as a libertarian I don’t see a lot of potential in the United States at it pertains to economic freedoms. I see the government encroaching more and more into our lives. Is this the type of country I want to raise a family in? I certainly don’t want to be outside the United States (no offense towards anyone outside of the U.S). Maybe my goal is political. I’ve always wanted to run for office. Maybe governor one day. Would I be able to avoid the waves of bipartisanship, and actually do what I believe is the best for the people of my state. Or would I collapse under the political pressures and sign up for agreements I know in my heart and mind won’t help the people. Only time will tell. I just don’t see a point. I actually have many goals, but I struggle to see the overall point of accomplishing any of it. Especially seeing as anything I do will be lost in the ink-blots of history. What is the author's dream car? - Audi - Ferrari - Jaguar - not enough information","output":"It seems like you are experiencing a crisis of purpose, which is not uncommon. It's important to remember that life is a journey, and your goals and aspirations may change over time as you grow and learn more about yourself. You've mentioned several potential paths, including spiritual, family, economic, and political goals. It's natural to feel uncertain or overwhelmed about the direction you should take, and that's okay. Regarding the concept of perfection and heaven, it's essential to keep in mind that individual beliefs and perceptions of perfection vary. It's possible that your idea of heaven may differ from others, or that it may evolve as you continue to develop spiritually. Delving deeper into your spiritual beliefs and exploring various spiritual paths can be a way to find grounding and purpose in life. In relation to the question of raising a family in the United States, it is true that the country currently faces many challenges, including economic and political issues. As a potential future parent, you can still instill your values and beliefs into your children to ensure that they grow up to be resilient, independent thinkers. If you do choose to pursue politics, this could be a way for you to have a direct impact on your community or state. When it comes to your political aspirations, it is possible to hold on to your beliefs and navigate the complexities of politics without compromising on what you believe is right for the people. This would require courage, determination, and resilience, but it is certainly possible to foster positive change in a leadership position. Now, addressing the issue of accomplishments being lost in history, it's vital to realize that life isn't solely about achieving external milestones or gaining societal recognition. The experiences you have, the people you meet, and the lessons you learn along the way are all valuable aspects of your life's journey. Personal growth, fulfillment, and creating a meaningful life will ultimately lead to a sense of purpose. It's essential to remember that you don't need to choose just one path or have a singular goal in life. It is possible to pursue multiple goals and aspirations simultaneously or sequentially throughout your lifetime. Embrace a growth mindset and remain open to change, adaptation, and evolution, as these aspects of life can bring richness and meaning as you work towards your multifaceted goals.

In absolute terms, the planet has lost 52% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2014 study by the World Wildlife Fund. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that \\"the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago\\".

Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America, plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"A long-distance relationship (LDR) works through consistent communication, trust, understanding, and setting clear expectations. While it's true that being physically apart from your partner presents unique challenges, a successful long-distance relationship is possible and has been achieved by many couples. The key elements in making an LDR work include: 1. Communication: One of the most important factors in maintaining any relationship, communication is especially vital in a long-distance relationship. It's crucial to establish open lines of communication where both parties can express their feelings, concerns, and needs. Utilize technology such as video calls, texts, voice calls, and instant messaging to stay connected with your partner. 2. Trust: Trust is the foundation of every relationship. In a long-distance relationship, it's particularly important to trust that your partner is committed and will stay faithful. Insecurity or jealousy can poison the relationship, so both partners need to work on building trust by being honest and open with one another. 3. Expectations: Set clear expectations about the level of commitment, schedule for communication, visits, and any other aspects of the relationship. Being on the same page about what each person expects from the LDR can help avoid disappointment and misunderstandings. 4. Quality time: Even though you cannot be physically together, sharing experiences and quality time is crucial. Plan to watch movies or TV shows simultaneously, play online games together, or have a \\"virtual date\\" on video calls. 5. Set goals: Discuss and establish short-term and long-term goals together. Having a plan helps both parties know what they are working towards and provides hope for the future. Goals could include planned visits, future vacations, or plans to eventually live in the same location. 6. Be supportive: Emotional support is significant in a long-distance relationship. Be there for your partner during the ups and downs, knowing that separation can sometimes amplify feelings of loneliness or stress. 7. Visits: Plan regular visits to spend quality time together, providing opportunities to strengthen the bond, and create shared memories. Having visits to look forward to can provide motivation during harder times. 8. Cultivate individual growth: Although it's essential to focus on your relationship, having personal goals, hobbies and a social life can make the time apart feel more manageable and help maintain a sense of identity. Yes, there are numerous examples of successful long-distance relationships. Couples who flourish despite the distance often demonstrate the key elements mentioned earlier - communication, trust, and having shared goals. It's important to note that what might work for one couple may not suit others, but with effort, flexibility, and commitment, a long-distance relationship can be successful.

Possible A: determine word's definition, thesaurus, eat cake, novel, encyclopedia  Why is \\"novel\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Novel\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the question \\"He wore out his dictionary as he worked on his what?\\" because it implies that the person was putting in a significant amount of effort and time into a project that involves language and word usage, which requires regular consultation of a dictionary. The process of novel writing demands a writer to correctly use vocabulary and grammar, maintain a coherent plot, and develop characters and themes. At times, the writer may want to incorporate obscure, specific, or complex language to convey their ideas effectively or add depth, richness, and authenticity to their story. By regularly using a dictionary during the composition of the novel, the writer can verify the meanings, spelling, and pronunciation of words, avoid using the same word repetitively, and discover new vocabulary to enhance their prose. This process would naturally lead to wearing out the dictionary, as it is heavily relied upon. The other possible answers do not align with human common sense as much as \\"novel\\" does because: 1. \\"Determine word's definition\\" does not identify a specific project or work that requires wearing out a dictionary. It only states a general purpose of using a dictionary, which lacks relevance to the question's context. 2. \\"Thesaurus\\" suggests searching for synonyms or related words, which is not directly aligned with wearing out a dictionary. Although interlinked, a dictionary and thesaurus have distinct functions. Using a dictionary primarily involves working with meanings, while a thesaurus deals with word alternatives. 3. \\"Eat cake\\" does not relate to a linguistically-centered task. The phrase implies an unrelated activity to language or dictionary usage and does not require consultation of a dictionary. 4. \\"Encyclopedia\\" can be an expansive project encompassing vast subject matter. However, its focus is on factual knowledge rather than language development and vocabulary usage. While writing an encyclopedia might occasionally involve dictionary consultation, it is not necessarily a human common sense answer in this context, as the emphasis of an encyclopedia is on providing comprehensive data rather than intricate language nuance, like the case in novels. In conclusion, \\"novel\\" is the answer aligned with human common sense because it represents a substantial undertaking involving language, creativity, and vocabulary, ultimately leading to the exhaustive usage of a dictionary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Designed to suit the needs of those doors that necessitate special reinforcement or require SKG certification against burglary Add punctuation.","output":"Designed to suit the needs of those doors that necessitate special reinforcement, or require SKG certification against burglary, the following approach provides a detailed explanation of how to develop and incorporate such a security system. First, it is essential to understand the purpose of SKG certification. SKG is a Dutch organization that evaluates and certifies security products based on their resistance to various forms of forced entry. A product with an SKG-rating has undergone a series of tests to ensure that it can effectively withstand burglary attempts. To design a door with special reinforcement that meets SKG certification requirements, the following steps should be taken: 1. Material selection: Choose the appropriate materials for constructing the door. Certain materials, such as steel and solid wood, offer greater resistance to forced entry. Combining materials may also be an option to further strengthen the door. 2. Door structure: Design the door with a strong and durable structure that can withstand a great deal of force. This can include reinforced framing, thick or multiple layers of material, and a robust core. Additionally, the door should have a tight and secure fit within the door frame to minimize the possibility of prying it open. 3. Locks and hardware: Incorporate high-quality locks and hardware, preferably those that have already obtained SKG certification or similar accreditation. This can include deadbolts, multi-point locking systems, and cylinder locks. The lock structure and installation should minimize the risk of lock picking, drilling, and bumping. The use of strike plates on the door frame can also help distribute the force of an attempted break-in, making it more difficult to breach the door. 4. Hinges and fastening: Strong, durable hinges are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the door. Consider using heavy-duty or security hinges that are resistant to manipulation. Ensure that the screws used to fasten the hinges are long enough to provide a strong connection between the door and the door frame. 5. Security bars and bolts: Additional security measures, such as bars and bolts, can enhance the door's overall resistance to forced entry. These can be installed on both the interior and exterior sides of the door, providing an extra layer of protection. 6. Glass and window reinforcement: If the door has glass or window elements, it is essential to use reinforced or laminated glass that is resistant to smashing. In some cases, security film or bars can be added to increase the overall strength of the glass. Ensure that any window frames are also designed for maximum security. 7. Ensure proper installation: All components of the door system should be installed by a professional who understands the importance of secure door installation. Proper alignment, fastening, and sealing techniques should be employed to provide the best possible security. 8. Maintenance: Regular maintenance is essential to ensuring continued optimal performance of the door. This may include checking locks, hardware, and hinges for wear and damage, lubricating moving parts, and replacing any parts that have become compromised. In summary, to design a door with special reinforcement that meets SKG certification requirements, one must consider various aspects such as material selection, structural design, locks and hardware, hinges and fastening, incorporating additional security measures, reinforcing glass and windows, ensuring proper installation, and adhering to regular maintenance. By closely following these guidelines, you can create a significantly more secure door that can effectively withstand burglary attempts and meet SKG certification standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 1700s. Although most colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left. Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in North America, especially in large urban centers of the U.S. and Canada, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Toronto, Baltimore, Miami, Chicago, Denver and Cleveland. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in New York City were Russian-speaking Jews. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the United States Census, in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.

It was when Occidente passed a law in 1825 making the Yaqui its citizens and subjecting them to taxes that the Yaqui decided to go to war, since they had not previously been subjected to taxes.  The first fighting was at Rahum.  The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol. The Yaqui coalesced around Juan Banderas as their leader.  Banderas managed to get the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexican government.  Occidente was so affected by the war that the capital was moved from Cosala to Fuerte. In 1827 Banderas' forces were defeated by Mexicans in the vicinity of Hermosillo.  This defeat was partly due to the Yaquis having primarily bows and arrows, while the Mexicans had guns.  After this defeat, Banderas negotiated a peace with Occidente, in which he was granted pardon, and recognized as captain-general of the Yaqui town, and was given a salary. In 1828 the office of captain-general was abolished, and Occidente government reasserted its right to tax the Yaqui, as well as proposing a plan for allotting the Yaqui lands.  In 1832 Banderas renewed the war against the Mexican authorities, in cooperation with Dolores Gutiérrez, a chief of the Opata people. In 1833 Banderas and Gutiérrez were executed after their forces were defeated in a battle near Buenavista, Mexico. Based on the above article, answer a question.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall.

Answer:","output":"The busiest Amtrak route that does not stop at either Lortorn Station is the Northeast Regional. This service operates primarily along the Northeast Corridor, linking major cities in the northeastern United States, including Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. It is important to note that Lortorn Station is not an actual station on the Amtrak system. However, considering the query's intention, our focus is on the busiest route that does not include a particular station. In this case, the Northeast Regional fits the description, as it is the busiest Amtrak route and does not include any station by the name of Lortorn Station. The Northeast Regional operates more than 100 trains daily, serving approximately 8 million passengers annually. This makes it the highest ridership route in the Amtrak network, with almost 40 percent of all passengers using this service. The route spans approximately 457 miles and has a travel time of around 9 hours and 30 minutes when covering the full length of the line between Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. The route includes multiple station stops that serve urban centers, suburban communities, and prominent economic hubs. Some of the major stations along the Northeast Regional route include: 1. South Station (Boston, Massachusetts) - Serving as the northern terminus for the route, South Station is a major rail hub for Boston, connecting with several local commuter rail lines and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) subway system. 2. New York Penn Station (New York City, New York) - The busiest station in the Amtrak system, New York Penn Station sees over 10 million Amtrak passengers each year. It also provides connections to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), New Jersey Transit, and the New York City subway. 3. 30th Street Station (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) - Another busy station in the Amtrak network, 30th Street Station serves as a major hub for the city of Philadelphia, offering connections to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and the Philadelphia subway system. 4. Baltimore Penn Station (Baltimore, Maryland) - Serving as an important stop between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, Baltimore Penn Station provides access to the city's major attractions and the surrounding region. 5. Washington Union Station (Washington, D.C.) - As the southern terminus of the route, Washington Union Station is a major transportation hub in the capital city, providing access to various commuter rail lines and Washington's Metro system. It also serves as the starting point for many of Amtrak's long-distance trains. The Northeast Regional's popularity is primarily due to its convenient, frequent service and connectivity between major cities in the northeastern United States. It offers a practical alternative to driving or flying, allowing passengers to avoid congested highways and airport security lines. Additionally, the route passes through many densely populated areas, enabling it to serve a large proportion of the U.S. population."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending.

Options: - not enough information   - Before thinking she had a sense of her every day life   - After reading the quote  by Annie Dillard   - Before creating a sense of 'the day' === The correct answer is A:","output":"The correct answer is - After reading the quote by Annie Dillard. Based on the narrative provided, it's evident that the narrator's perspective of her self-identity was shaken after reading Annie Dillard's quote about how our day-to-day activities define our lives. Upon absorbing this newfound perspective, she decided to shift her focus from an internal list of identifiers to an inspection of her daily life, hence beginning a self-portrait that more accurately represented her identity. Pertinently, the narrator starts creating her self-portrait post this realization. She actively decided to capture the mundane aspects of her life, moving away from a linear narrative to implement a more abstract portrayal of her everyday reality, effectively reflecting the subtleties that collectively shape her existence. Therefore, the timeline of the narrator starting her self-portrait follows her reading of Annie Dillard's quote, making \\"after reading the quote by Annie Dillard\\" the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble and matron Mrs. Corney. At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin.

In 1882, a hydroelectric power plant was built at Saint Anthony Falls, marking one of the first developments of hydroelectric power in the United States.  Iron mining began in northern Minnesota with the opening of the Soudan Mine in 1884.  The Vermilion Range was surveyed and mapped by a party financed by Charlemagne Tower.  Another mining town, Ely began with the foundation of the Chandler Mine in 1888.  Soon after, the Mesabi Range was established when ore was found just under the surface of the ground in Mountain Iron.  The Mesabi Range ultimately had much more ore than the Vermilion Range, and it was easy to extract because the ore was closer to the surface.  As a result, open-pit mines became well-established on the Mesabi Range, with 111 mines operating by 1904.  To ship the iron ore to refineries, railroads such as the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway were built from the iron ranges to Two Harbors and Duluth on Lake Superior.  Large ore docks were used at these cities to load the iron ore onto ships for transport east on the Great Lakes.  The mining industry helped to propel Duluth from a small town to a large, thriving city.  In 1904, iron was discovered in the Cuyuna Range in Crow Wing County.  Between 1904 and 1984, when mining ceased, more than 106 million tons of ore were mined.  Iron from the Cuyuna Range also contained significant proportions of manganese, increasing its value.  Question: What is the name of the range that had less ore than the one that established 111 mines?","output":"The name of the range that had less ore than the one that established 111 mines is the Vermilion Range. This is established based on two information segments from the passage. The first information segment states, \\"the Mesabi Range ultimately had much more ore than the Vermilion Range,\\" which suggests that the Vermilion Range had less ore. The second information piece is, \\"As a result, open-pit mines became well-established on the Mesabi Range, with 111 mines operating by 1904\\" verifying the number of mines on the Mesabi Range. Hence the only other range mentioned juxtaposed against the ore abundance of Mesabi Range is the Vermilion Range."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - air - rock - arctic - log - field  Explain why a human would choose \\"field\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"field\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Insects are known to thrive in areas with vegetation: A field, typically filled with a variety of plants and grasses, provides an ideal habitat for insects. These plants not only serve as a food source but also offer shelter and breeding grounds. Thus, the probability of finding insects eating something green in a field is much higher compared to other options. 2. Understanding the other options:    a) Air: While some insects are airborne, they do not consume food while flying. Insects usually land on a surface to feed on plants, making it an implausible place to find them eating something green.       b) Rock: Rocks are generally devoid of vegetation, which means that insects would not be able to find something green to eat in such an environment.    c) Arctic: The harsh, cold conditions of the Arctic make it an unsuitable environment for most insects to survive, let alone find something green to eat.    d) Log: Although some insects do live around or inside fallen logs and can sometimes feed on the moss or lichen growing on the surface, a field would offer a much wider diversity and abundance of food resources for insects. Considering the reasons above, a human would choose \\"field\\" as the most likely place to find insects eating something green."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who showed artistic promise from an early age?, using the article: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice.

Who will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes?  Jake and his brother Jordan both have to go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled. Jake is allergic to the anesthetic unfortunately, so he has to have the procedure done without it. Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected.  Hint: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.

Sentence 2: Another important route that crossed the Palmyra area included the road which led from the Bindnagle settlement to Campbelltown , which is now PA 117 . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While these two sentences may initially appear to convey the same information due to their similar structure and wording, there are some key differences between them that result in divergent implications. To evaluate their distinction, we shall first dissect both sentences individually and then compare the information presented within them. Sentence 1: \\"Another important route that crossed the Campbelltown territory included the road that led from the Bindnagle settlement to Palmyra, which is now PA 117.\\" In this sentence, the focal point of the information presented is the Campbelltown territory. A notable route crossed this area, connecting the Bindnagle settlement and Palmyra. The current designation of this road is PA 117. Sentence 2: \\"Another important route that crossed the Palmyra area included the road which led from the Bindnagle settlement to Campbelltown, which is now PA 117.\\" Conversely, in this sentence, the emphasis lies on the Palmyra area. As it highlights the Bindnagle settlement's connection to Campbelltown, it suggests that the analyzed route crosses Palmyra. Similarly as before, the road is now labeled PA 117. While both sentences investigate the same road (PA 117) and mention the Bindnagle settlement, Campbelltown, and Palmyra, the key discrepancy between them lies in the conveyed connections. Sentence 1 suggests that PA 117 links the Bindnagle settlement to Palmyra, passing through the Campbelltown territory. In contrast, Sentence 2 implies that the route connects the Bindnagle settlement to Campbelltown, traversing the Palmyra area. Though these sentences exhibit similarities, such as the road and places involved, they are not equivalent in the presented information. In summary, the sentences differ with respect to the destinations and the territories the route crosses while connecting the Bindnagle settlement to either Palmyra or Campbelltown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT:  - No;  - Yes; I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how is rfid tag powered Suggested answer: Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate the given answer as it doesn't respond accurately to the question asked. The question seeks to understand how RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags are powered. The response provided, about tracking pharmaceuticals through warehouses, though related to a potential application of RFID technology, does not address the asked question directly. As such, it is not providing the information the question seeks. Rather, the question, \\"how is RFID tag powered?\\" should be answered as: RFID tags are powered in one of three ways, depending on the type of tag they are: passive, active, or semi-passive. 1. Passive RFID tags: These are powered by the radio wave signal from a nearby RFID reader. The reader emits a signal, which the passive tag captures with its antenna. The energy from the signal is then converted into electrical energy, which powers up the embedded microchip, allowing it to transmit a response back to the reader. It is worth noting that these tags are only active when within range of an RFID reader. 2. Active RFID tags: These possess their own power source, typically a battery, which is used to power the microchip and transmit the signal to the reader. This power source enables active RFID tags to transmit signals over much greater distances than their passive counterparts, even up to several hundred meters. 3. Semi-Passive (or Battery-Assisted Passive) RFID tags: These are a sort of hybrid between passive and active tags. Like active tags, they have their own battery, but this is used only to power up the microchip. The transmission of the signal to the reader, however, is powered the same way as in passive tags, by capturing energy from the reader's radio wave signal. The battery assistance allows for a stronger signal response and greater range than passive tags, but less than active tags. In summary, the powering of an RFID tag depends fundamentally on its type, with passive RFID tags deriving power from the reader's signal, active tags using a built-in power source, and semi-passive tags using a combination of both."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The statement indicates that people in Parliament might be skilled in discussing the matter, but perhaps they aren't as successful when it comes to implementing those discussions and ideas in terms of tangible actions. It suggests a potential disconnect between dialogue and real-life results, highlighting a potential area for improvement in the political system. Furthermore, this could also be interpreted as a general observation on the nature of politics and political debates, where sometimes more emphasis is given to oratory skills and elaborate arguments, rather than genuinely addressing issues and finding practical solutions. The speaker seems to raise concerns about the effectiveness and sincerity of the debate and decision-making process happening in Parliament, which could lead to a consideration of this phenomenon extending beyond the specific matter they were referring to. This statement also allows us to analyze the nature and purpose of parliamentary debates. In general, these conversations aim at offering an open platform for elected representatives to air their views and ideas, identify problems, and eventually, reach consensus on various policies and resolutions. However, as the quote conveys, there could be a gap between the theoretical conversations taking place and the execution of agreed-upon solutions. Closing this gap would require increased focus on the practical implementation of decisions and more coordination among various stakeholders. Overall, the translation of this sentence to English conveys a sense of criticism and frustration with the current functioning of Parliament. It delivers an important message that more attention should be given to turning the discussions and debates in political assemblies into purposeful actions that genuinely impact and benefit society.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the cancellation was announced, how did the people of North Korea feel about it?

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope John Paul, looking tired and  speaking with difficulty, put five Catholics on the road to  sainthood on Sunday, including the 19th century German mystic  nun who inspired Mel Gibson's film on Christ's passion.","output":"This passage is about Pope John Paul II's (at the time) recent canonization of five Catholics, putting them on the path to sainthood. The event took place in Vatican City, and though the Pope appeared to be exhausted and had trouble speaking, he successfully conducted the ceremony. Among the five individuals who were beatified by John Paul II, one significant figure was the 19th-century German mystic nun Anne Catherine Emmerich. She is known for her visions and writings on the life and passion of Jesus Christ. Emmerich's work served as a primary inspiration for Mel Gibson's 2004 film, \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" which focused on Christ's last 12 hours leading up to his crucifixion. To better understand the central topics in this passage, some key aspects can be briefly discussed: 1. Pope John Paul II: As the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, Pope John Paul II (1978-2005) was one of the most influential and widely respected religious figures of his time. He was known for his strong positions on social and moral teachings, as well as his efforts to improve interfaith dialogue and promote peace worldwide. 2. Sainthood and Canonization: According to Catholic tradition, sainthood is the process through which certain deceased individuals are recognized by the Church as having led exemplary lives of heroic virtue and holiness. The official process of canonization is where the Pope formally declares that someone is in heaven and can be venerated as a saint. This involves thorough investigation into the person's life, as well as verifying the occurrence of miracles attributed to their intercession. 3. Anne Catherine Emmerich: Born in Germany in 1774, Emmerich was a Roman Catholic nun who experienced visions related to the life of Jesus Christ. She was a stigmatic, which meant that she bore the physical marks of Christ's crucifixion on her body. Emmerich authored a book called \\"The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ,\\" detailing her visions of the events leading to Christ's crucifixion. The book became widely popular and was eventually used as inspiration for Mel Gibson's film. 4. Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\": This 2004 film, directed by Mel Gibson, is a dramatic and graphic representation of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life, based primarily on the writings of Anne Catherine Emmerich. The film generated immense controversy due to its violent content, portrayals of historical and biblical events, and perceived anti-Semitic themes, but it also garnered significant praise and succeeded at the box office.  In summary, this passage discusses the canonization of five Catholics, including Anne Catherine Emmerich, by Pope John Paul II. The notable German mystic nun served as an inspiration for Mel Gibson's film on Christ's passion, and her visionary writings played a significant role in shaping contemporary interpretations of the events surrounding Jesus's crucifixion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One day Michael decides to head out to the cliff and notices the sky looks much more red than normal. He also remembers that on the previous day he couldn't see his shadow at all.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Given Michael goes out one day and notices he can't see his shadow, which is the most likely weather, clear skies or overcast?  Hint: When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset. A:","output":"Given that Michael goes out one day and notices he can't see his shadow, the most likely weather is overcast.

While crustal deformation can cause some alteration in bedrock, it is not known for leaving a polished appearance. b) Frequent earthquakes: Earthquakes can cause fractures and shifts in bedrock, but they typically do not result in the scraping or polishing of the bedrock's surface. c) Glacial movement: When glaciers move over bedrock, they can scrape, grind, and polish the surface of the rocks. Massachusetts was once covered by glaciers, predominantly during the last Ice Age. As a result, this option appears to be the most plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon. d) Volcanic eruptions: Volcanic activity can indeed alter bedrock, but it is not known for causing a polished appearance. While there is evidence of ancient volcanic activity in Massachusetts, it is not a predominant geological process in the region.

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Given the background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  and the situation: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few.  Answer the following question: Which village experiences fewer rocks breaking? The answer is:","output":"Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking. The background information provided states that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and it is the movement of these plates due to convection within the Earth that causes stresses to build up in rocks. When the stresses become too much for the rocks to handle, they break, releasing stored energy in the form of an earthquake. Elastic rebound theory explains this process. In the given situation, two nearby villages - Bow and Arrow - experience earthquakes. Bow village encounters a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village experiences only a few. Since the occurrence of earthquakes is directly related to the breaking and movement of rocks along plate boundaries, it can be deduced that Arrow village, which has a lower frequency of earthquakes, will also experience fewer instances of rocks breaking. This outcome could be attributed to various factors, such as Arrow village being situated slightly farther from the plate boundary or in an area with more stable geological conditions. It is also possible that the zones of stress and associated rock breakage are more concentrated around Bow village. In conclusion, Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking due to its lower frequency of earthquakes compared to Bow village. The exact reasons for this difference can vary depending on the specific geological conditions surrounding each village, but the overall outcome remains consistent with the principles of elastic rebound theory and plate tectonics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Boone, Ia. -Poor and elderly people may soon go without legal representation in Boone County. Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Information:  - Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Tech house is a subgenre of house music that mixes elements of techno with house. The term \\"tech house\\" developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as \\"rugged basslines\\" and \\"steely beats,\\" with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C & Plink Plonk, Heart & Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen. By the late 90's London nightclub The End, owned by the former Shamen rapper Richard West (Mr C) and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. Tech house tracks are typically between 610 minutes in length.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Trance is a genre of electronic music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \\"peaks\\" or \\"drops.\\" Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music.  - Matthias Paul, better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk (born 16 December 1971 in Eisenhüttenstadt, East Germany) is a German Grammy Award-winning DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release \\"Reflections\\". He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by \\"Mixmag\\" in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide.  - The Politics of Dancing 2 is an album of trance music mixed by Paul van Dyk as a sequel to his The Politics of Dancing .  - Mixmag is a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, published in London, England. Launched in 1982, the magazine covers dance events, and reviews music and club nights.  - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany.   - Eisenhüttenstadt (literally \\"ironworks city\\" in German) is a town in the Oder-Spree district of the state of Brandenburg, Germany, on the border with Poland.

Please answer the following question: Here's a short story: Hank's salt shaker rolled more slowly over his napkin than over the table. He then surmised that the _____ was rougher (A) napkin (B) table.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"napkin\\" and  \\"table\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"napkin\\" and \\"table\\" is \\"napkin\\" (A).  In the short story, it is mentioned that Hank's salt shaker rolled more slowly over his napkin than over the table. If the salt shaker rolled slower on the napkin, it can be inferred that the surface of the napkin was offering more resistance to the motion of the salt shaker than the table did. This increased resistance can be attributed to the roughness, or texture, of the napkin compared to the table.  Napkins are usually made from fabrics, such as cloth or paper, which have a more textured surface than a typical dining table, which might have a smoother hard surface like wood, plastic, or metal. This textured surface of the napkin would create more friction, causing the salt shaker to roll more slowly as it moves over it.  On the other hand, table surfaces are typically designed to be flat and smooth in order to make it easier to place and slide objects as needed during a meal. Therefore, it would make more sense for the salt shaker to roll more effortlessly on the table compared to the napkin. In conclusion, it can be reasonably deduced from the given information that the napkin (A) was rougher, as it caused the salt shaker to roll more slowly on its surface when compared to the table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Add spaces between the words in the following text: Atiltrotatorprovidesanexcavatorwithentirelynewflexibilityandgivestheoperatortheabilitytoperformoperationswithoutaconstantneedtomovethemachine.","output":"A tiltrotator provides an excavator with entirely new flexibility and gives the operator the ability to perform operations without a constant need to move the machine. A tiltrotator is a versatile attachment for excavators that allows the excavator's bucket to rotate a full 360 degrees and tilt up to 45 degrees in any direction. This innovative attachment enables the operator to perform a range of tasks that would be difficult or impossible with a standard excavator. Instead of having to constantly reposition the entire machine to align the bucket with the task at hand, the operator can simply adjust the tiltrotator to achieve the desired angle and orientation, saving both time and effort. The benefits of using a tiltrotator-equipped excavator are numerous, especially for tasks such as digging trenches, grading surfaces, and operating in confined spaces. As the bucket can be rotated and tilted independently of the main machine, the operator can more easily carry out complex tasks, resulting in greater efficiency and productivity on the work site. Improved flexibility and precision are two critical advantages offered by tiltrotators. In addition to the enhanced control provided by the 360-degree rotation and 45-degree tilt capabilities, tiltrotators often come equipped with additional functions, such as an integrated gripper or a quick coupler system. These extra features further expand the versatility of the excavator, enabling it to perform tasks that would typically require separate machines or attachments. Operators also enjoy improved safety when using a tiltrotator-equipped excavator. The need to constantly move the machine to complete tasks is significantly reduced, which not only results in less wear and tear on the machine itself, but also minimizes the risk of accidents caused by frequent maneuvering. Additionally, the added precision offered by the tiltrotator attachment allows operators to work more efficiently in tight spaces, reducing the likelihood of unintentionally damaging nearby infrastructure or property. In conclusion, a tiltrotator provides an excavator with entirely new flexibility and gives the operator the ability to perform operations without a constant need to move the machine. This innovative attachment enhances the capabilities of excavators, making them more versatile, efficient, and safer to use. Consequently, the adoption of tiltrotators is a worthwhile investment for any company or individual looking to maximize the productivity and effectiveness of their excavator operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.

Background: Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski (February 19, 1918 - October 30, 2009) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1940 and with the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks in 1942. Evashevski served as the head football coach at Hamilton College in 1941, Washington State University from 1950 to 1951, and the University of Iowa from 1952 to 1960, compiling a career record of 68-35-6. Evashevski's 1958 Iowa team went 8-1-1, winning the Big Ten Conference title and defeating the California Golden Bears in the 1959 Rose Bowl. Context: \\"People in the Midwest are my people and I wanted to be back among them...And, of course, I don't have to tell you what I think of Big Ten football. It's the best in the country.\\" With those words, Evashevski left the Palouse in eastern Washington to become the University of Iowa's 19th head football coach.  Evashevski nearly took the head coaching job at Indiana University, but Fritz Crisler urged him to consider Iowa. He felt that it would be easier to attain statewide support at Iowa than in Indiana, where Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame shared the spotlight. Evashevski was familiar with Iowa City from his stint with the Naval Pre-Flight School. Crisler was the man who recommended Evashevski to Iowa's athletic director, Paul Brechler. Crisler did warn Brechler, however, that Evashevski was \\"a tough, stubborn Polack, and you might have to put the reins on him.\\"  In 1952, Iowa football had only had three winning seasons in the previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades. A United Press International story named three football programs in 1952 with new coaches that would struggle to ever be competitive: Iowa, Indiana, and Pittsburgh. Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, starting the year 0-2. But Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, \\"Do you think Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?\\" Evashevski snapped, \\"Why in the hell do you think I took the job?\\" Afterwards, a photographer noted, \\"I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football.\\" Question: What words did he say before leaving?.

Context: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

How women are wresting back time The wine business is fun but “one tends to work evenings and weekends,” said Kettlewell, now 53. “It’s not 9-to-5 and then there’s traveling… It just gets to where you have to schedule the laundry.” Still, Kettlewell loved her work with wine. So she did something unexpected. Rather than chasing the illusive work-life balance, she created something new altogether. Three years ago, she co-founded Creative Palate, a public relations and marketing firm for vintners and wine importers, with another colleague. Now, her hours are her own. As her own boss, she can meet with clients yet still carve out time for family and friends. Even more importantly, she has something she values more than prestige or an astronomical salary — flexibility. “I needed a new challenge and starting our own business was part of that,” said Kettlewell. “But the opportunity to manage my schedule... was the primary factor in the decision to strike out on my own.” Kettlewell is one of a new generation of high-powered women who are redefining success. Rather than racking up prestige, titles and money with powerful jobs working for other people, they seek flexibility while continuing to expand their career. Jane Kettlewell (L) and her partner, Kate Morgan-Corcoran, set up a wine tasting for a client of their company Creative Palate. (Allison Drew Klein) Jane Kettlewell (L) and her partner, Kate Morgan-Corcoran, set up a wine tasting for a client of their company Creative Palate. (Allison Drew Klein) A majority of women globally want more flexibility in the workplace, according to LinkedIn’s What Women Want @ Work survey. The survey, which polled 5,000 professional women in 13 countries ––including Brazil, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands –– found that almost two-thirds of those asked wanted greater flexibility in the workplace. Meanwhile, the importance women placed on salary when defining professional accomplishments had fallen in the past decade to 45% from 56%. Having an interesting job came out ahead at 58%, according to the study, published in March 2013. “As women progress in their careers, their definition of success seems to have transformed,” said Ngaire Moyes, a LinkedIn spokeswoman. “Modern working women are not just striving for positions of power or a higher salary. Today’s professional women are far more likely to define success as having an interesting and fulfilling job and being able to successfully balance their work and home lives.” In the US, government programs help fund entrepreneurs. The US Small Business Administration loaned women 3.8bn in 2013, up 31% since 2009, according Erin Andrew, the agency’s assistant administrator for women's business ownership. “Right now, we have 7.8m women-owned businesses in the United States, which is a 20% increase from 2002 to 2007 and we’re continuing to see increases in the number of women-owned businesses,” Andrew said. “Women are usually at 50% or above in our microloan portfolio.” (Microloans are those for 50,000 or less). There has been a slow rise in the size of the loans women are seeking. This is a good sign because it means they are thinking “beyond personal loans and credit cards and taking on more debt for business that will inevitably, probably, grow,” Andrew said. “It’s a trend we are seeing.” London-based Anita Heathcote, who heads her own sales, marketing and public relations firm aimed at the luxury hotel industry, said she started ATP Heathcote & Associates Ltd in 2007 without any help from the British government. She said she was unaware of any similar financing help in the UK. Anita Heathcote was frustrated by the rigidity and expectations of hours spent in the office. (Michael McGlone/Broadcast Support) Anita Heathcote was frustrated by the rigidity and expectations of hours spent in the office. (Michael McGlone/Broadcast Support) Even without such aid, Heathcote was determined to become her own boss. “I started my own company because I did not enjoy corporate politics,” Heathcote said. “I wanted to put my years of experience, past achievements and large network of contacts to good use, and I wanted to address the poor quality of life and stress that I went through never having enough time to tackle my own personal / domestic jobs, or go to the gym without having to get up at dark o’clock in the morning.” Heathcote added, “I am also in my early 50s now, and to be honest, I did feel my age was starting to work against me succeeding further in the corporate world.” Now, she doesn’t have to look busy. If a personal matter demands Heathcote take time in the afternoon, “I don’t mind clearing my emails at night… when things have gone quiet.” And working from home a few days a week saves her “at least another three hours a day of rush hour traveling time,” she said. There have been some challenges. For one, she is bringing home less than she did at her previous positions. Still, Heathcote has found the flexibility of being self-employed has improved her quality of life. “There is a financial unpredictability that comes with this,” she said. “But generally, hard work results in better remuneration including the hard work involved in finding new clients and in keeping existing clients happy.” Eva Bocchiola, a 56-year-old psychotherapist in Milan, left her job in finance two-and-a-half years ago after her third child was born. “It took me a long time and a therapy to realise and to accept that it was impossible, at least for me, to keep together a family with three children and a very demanding job.” Eva Bocchiola turned to therapy when the struggle of managing family and work became too much.

Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.  I am facing a new situation today: Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor.

First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit.

Background: Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. Context: Hirsi Ali arrived in the Netherlands in 1992. That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in Dusseldorf and Bonn, Germany and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged arranged marriage. Once there, she requested political asylum and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather's early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands.  At first she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post. She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by The Observer newspaper, marked her deeply.  As an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000.  Between 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, Immigratie en Naturalisatiedienst). While working for the IND, she became critical of the way it handled asylum seekers. As a result of her education and experiences, Hirsi Ali speaks six languages: English, Somali, Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, and Dutch. Question: why did she go to the netherlands.

Is \\"\\" To limit protests, officials pushed parents to sign a document, which forbade them from holding protests, in exchange of money, but some who refused to sign were threatened.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, from the information provided, it appears that in exchange for signing the document, officials offered money to parents. This document was intended to limit protests by forbidding parents from participating in demonstrations against the officials. If the parents refused to sign the document, the officials would resort to threats in an attempt to coerce them into compliance.  In-depth, this arrangement can be interpreted as a controversial practice of authoritative coercion. The exchange — money for the signing of the document that forfeited a person's right to protest — can be seen as a form of bribery or a tactic of manipulation. While the officials ostensibly offer the monetary exchange as compensation for the individuals' voluntary relinquishment of their protest rights, the presence of threats for those who refused indicates that the officials were resistant to objections and reluctant to accept non-compliance. The transaction can also be viewed under the lens of societal and civil rights. If the protests were justified and aimed against unfair policies, then encouraging individuals to not protest through money and threats can be seen as suppressing their voices and inhibiting them from expressing their concerns. This raises ethical and legal issues since in democratic societies, the right to protest is usually recognized as a fundamental aspect of freedom of speech and assembly.  Conversely, if the protests were deemed harmful, disruptive, or based on false premises, the officials giving money in exchange for a cessation of these activities might be viewed in a different light. However, this interpretation depends heavily on the larger social, political, and ethical contexts surrounding this incident, which are not provided in the statement. As such, while the transaction was indeed money in exchange for signing a document to not protest, the implications and interpretations of this exchange can vary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Its main purpose was to overturn the laws which banned contraceptives from the U.S. mails.\\" be a reasonable answer? Pick your answer from: [-] No; [-] Yes; Answer:","output":"No, the provided information does not directly answer the question about when birth control was banned in the United States. Instead, it mentions the main purpose of overturning the laws related to contraceptives in the U.S. mails. Let me provide you with a more detailed and relevant answer to the question. The banning of birth control in the United States began with the enactment of the Comstock Law in 1873, which made it illegal to send any \\"obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious\\" materials through the mail. The law was named after its chief proponent, Anthony Comstock, and it included any form of birth control and information about birth control methods as part of the prohibited materials. It was enforced at both the federal and state levels. In addition, many states adopted their own versions of the Comstock Law, which further restricted access to contraceptives and information about them. Some states, like Connecticut, outright banned the use and sale of contraceptives for married couples. The controversy surrounding birth control in the United States continued until the mid-20th century. In 1965, the Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut struck down the Connecticut law that banned contraceptives for married couples, ruling that it violated the constitutional right to privacy. This decision set a legal precedent that signaled the beginning of a shift in societal and legal attitudes towards birth control. In conclusion, birth control was first banned in the United States with the Comstock Law in 1873, and these restrictive policies lasted until the mid-20th century when the Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut started to change the legal landscape. The provided statement about overturning laws related to contraceptives in the U.S. mails does not directly address the original question about the timeline of the ban on birth control in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He says that \\"cancer is a disease in which cells divide out of control\\" and \\"chemotherapy works on cells that are dividing\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What helps stop cells multiplying in cancer?\\" is chemotherapy, based on the hints provided by the teacher. Chemotherapy is a widely used treatment method that targets rapidly dividing cells, a key characteristic of cancer cells. It works by inhibiting the process of cell division, thus curbing the growth and spread of cancer within the body. Chemotherapy consists of a variety of drugs, which may be administered in different combinations depending on the type and stage of cancer. These drugs work collectively to disrupt the life cycle of cancer cells, targeting specific phases of the cycle, such as DNA synthesis, or the mitotic stage when the cell divides. The ultimate goal of chemotherapy is to eliminate the cancer cells or slow down their progression by stopping the multiplication of these cells. It is essential to note that chemotherapy doesn't specifically target cancer cells - it affects all rapidly dividing cells in the body, including healthy cells. This can lead to collateral damage and side effects such as hair loss, nausea, and a weakened immune system. However, many of these side effects are temporary and can be managed to some extent with the help of medications and support therapies. Apart from chemotherapy, other treatment methods to stop cancer cell multiplication include radiation therapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapies. Each of these treatments has its unique approach to tackling cancer cell growth, and they may be used in combination with chemotherapy or as standalone treatments, depending on the individual patient's cancer type and stage. In conclusion, chemotherapy is the best answer to the question of what helps stop cells multiplying in cancer due to its ability to target the rapid cell division that characterizes the disease. By disrupting the cell cycle and impeding the growth and spread of cancer, chemotherapy remains a critical component of modern cancer treatment strategies. Nonetheless, it is essential to recognize that different treatments may be appropriate for different cases, and ongoing research aims to develop more targeted and effective therapies to combat cancer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. (October 24, 1926 - October 8, 2017), better known as Y. A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. At the time of his retirement, Tittle held the following NFL records:  Tittle was the fourth player to throw seven touchdown passes in a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record.  Despite record statistics and three straight championship game appearances, Tittle was never able to deliver a title to his team. His record as a starter in postseason games was 0-4. He threw four touchdown passes against 14 interceptions and had a passer rating of 33.8 in his postseason career, far below his regular season passer rating of 74.3. Seth Wickersham, writing for ESPN The Magazine in 2014, noted the dichotomy in the 1960s between two of New York's major sports franchises: \\"... Gifford, Huff and Tittle, a team of Hall of Famers known for losing championships as their peers on the Yankees--with whom they shared a stadium, a city, and many rounds of drinks--became renowned for winning them.\\" The Giants struggled after Tittle's retirement, posting only two winning seasons from 1964 to 1980.  He made seven Pro Bowls, four first-team All-Pro teams, and four times was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player or Player of the Year: in 1957 and 1962 by the UPI; in 1961 by the NEA; and in 1963 by the AP and NEA. In a sports column in 1963, George Strickler for the Chicago Tribune remarked Tittle had \\"broken records that at one time appeared unassailable and he has been the hero of more second half rallies than Napoleon and the Harlem Globetrotters.\\" He was featured on four Sports Illustrated covers: three during his playing career and one shortly after retirement. His first was with the 49ers in 1954. With the Giants, he graced covers in November 1961, and he was on the season preview issue for 1964; a two-page fold-out photo from the 1963 title game. Tittle was on a fourth cover in August 1965.  The trade of Tittle for Lou Cordileone is seen as one of the worst trades in 49ers history; it is considered one of the best trades in Giants franchise history. Cordileone played just one season in San Francisco. Entity:","output":"Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr., better known as Y. A. Tittle, is the entity this text is about.

However, People Before Profit MLA Eamonn McCann said teachers were \\"defending the public service\\". Mr Weir also claimed the teaching unions had initially sought an annual pay rise of 8.23%, including increments, before reducing their demands to 3%. He warned the assembly that there was no more money in the education budget to increase pay to teachers. \\"If faced with the choice between additional pay or additional redundancies, I want to keep people in jobs,\\" he said. \\"I would appeal to any of the unions to suspend any industrial action, to try to have discussions in relation to this.\\" He also said that the management side of the Teachers' Negotiating Committee (TNC) had asked the five teaching unions to suspend their industrial action and hold more talks. Later, in response to a question from SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, Mr Weir accused some of the unions of putting forward \\"fantasy figures\\" on pay. However, People Before Profit MLA Eamonn McCann said teachers were giving a \\"good example\\". He urged the minister and other MLAs to join him alongside teachers on picket lines on 30 November. In response, Mr Weir accused Mr McCann of engaging in \\"fantasy politics\\". Last month, all teaching unions in Northern Ireland rejected an offer that would have seen their pay frozen last year and a rise of 1% for 2016-17. The NASUWT is one of the largest teaching unions in Northern Ireland, and is going on strike for the first time since 2011. While schools in Belfast and Newtownabbey will be the first to be affected, the union said that its members in other areas will then take similar action in January and February 2017. It is expected that there will be a significant impact in over 100 schools on 30 November, and some may be forced to close. The other teaching unions are currently engaged in industrial action short of a strike.
