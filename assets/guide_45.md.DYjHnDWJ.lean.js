However, some ways that individuals with wealth can potentially make money during a recession include: 1. Investing in undervalued stocks: During a recession, many companies experience a decrease in their stock prices. Wealthy individuals may choose to invest in these undervalued stocks, believing that the companies will eventually recover. 2. Purchasing distressed assets: Similar to investing in undervalued stocks, wealthy individuals may purchase distressed assets such as properties or businesses that are struggling during a recession. 3. Diversifying their investments: Wealthy individuals may have a diverse portfolio of investments that includes stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate. This diversification can help protect their wealth during a recession. 4. Taking advantage of low-interest rates: During a recession, interest rates may be lowered by banks and other lending institutions. Wealthy individuals may take advantage of these lower rates to invest in real estate or other assets. 5. Starting a business: Some wealthy individuals may seize the opportunity of a recession to start a new business or invest in startups that are poised for growth."},{"instruction":"Can you give specific examples","output":"Sure, here are some specific examples of how wealthy individuals have made money during recessions: 1. Warren Buffett: During the 2008 recession, Warren Buffett - one of the wealthiest men in the world - invested 5 billion in Goldman Sachs. The investment allowed Goldman Sachs to weather the recession and pay back the government loans that it had received. As a result, Buffett's investment in Goldman Sachs grew nearly four times, netting him several billion dollars in profit. 2. George Soros: During the 1992 recession, George Soros made an estimated 1 billion by betting against the British pound. Soros believed that the British government would not be able to maintain the currency's fixed exchange rate, and he shorted the pound, making a fortune when the currency collapsed. 3. John Paulson: During the 2008 recession, hedge fund manager John Paulson made billions of dollars by betting against the subprime mortgage market. Paulson's hedge fund made more than 15 billion in profit from the bet, which was one of the largest in history. 4. Michael Bloomberg: During the 2001 recession, Michael Bloomberg - the founder of Bloomberg LP - launched a new product called Bloomberg Terminal. The product, which provided real-time financial data to traders and investors, became hugely popular and helped Bloomberg's net worth grow to over 50 billion. 5. Elon Musk: During the 2008 recession, Tesla CEO Elon Musk raised 40 million in venture capital to keep his electric car company afloat. The move paid off, as Tesla has since become one of the most valuable car companies in the world, with Musk's net worth estimated at over 70 billion."},{"instruction":"Who owns the biggest chicken farm","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have access to the most recent updates on ownership of the biggest chicken farm in the world.

These companies operate chicken farms and processing plants in multiple countries and are among the world's largest food companies."},{"instruction":"Where do companies store their money","output":"Companies typically store their money in various types of financial accounts and investments. Some common places where companies may store their money include: 1. Checking accounts: Companies typically maintain checking accounts with banks to manage their day-to-day cash flow. 2. Savings accounts: Companies may also keep cash reserves in savings accounts, which typically offer higher interest rates than checking accounts. 3. Money market accounts: Money market accounts offer higher interest rates than savings accounts, although they often require higher minimum balances. 4. Certificates of deposit (CDs): CDs are time-bound investments that offer higher interest rates than savings accounts and money market accounts but also require companies to commit to leaving their money in the account for a predetermined period. 5. Treasury securities: Companies may invest in Treasury securities, which are bonds issued by the federal government and are generally considered to be low-risk investments. 6. Stocks and other securities: Companies may invest in stocks, bonds, and other securities as a way to earn a higher return on their cash reserves. Additionally, some companies may use stock buybacks to store excess cash. Companies may also use offshore bank accounts or tax havens to store money in order to minimize their tax liability. However, this practice is often controversial and can attract scrutiny from regulators and the public."},{"instruction":"What are offshore bank account companies","output":"An offshore bank account company is a business entity that provides banking services outside of the jurisdiction where it is registered or where its customers are located. Offshore bank account companies can be banks, financial institutions, or other companies that offer banking services such as account management, investment advice, and wealth management to individuals and businesses. Some offshore bank account companies may be registered in countries with favorable tax laws and lax regulatory environments, creating opportunities for tax avoidance or evasion. However, it’s important to note that offshore accounts can also be used legally and legitimately, such as for international business transactions or to protect assets in unstable or unsafe political or economic environments. Offshore bank account companies are often associated with high net worth individuals, as offshore banking services can offer a level of privacy, asset protection, and favorable taxation. However, offshore bank accounts are also used by multinational corporations and other companies for various financial purposes, including international trade and investment, tax planning, and risk management. It should be noted that offshore banking is a complex and highly regulated area of business, and individuals and companies considering it should seek expert advice to ensure they are complying with all relevant laws and regulations."},{"instruction":"Steps to sample a song","output":"To sample a song, you will need a few tools and materials as well as some basic knowledge in music production.

If Simon says \\"touch your nose,\\" you touch your nose. If Simon says \\"jump on one foot,\\" you jump on one foot. But what if Simon says something different? What if Simon says \\"touch your nose if you're wearing a blue shirt, otherwise stomp your feet.\\" To tackle this, we would use a similar structure in coding called if-else statements. If-else statements allow us to check a condition or set of conditions, and then execute different code depending on what those conditions are. Here's an example in code: \`\`\` shirt_color = input(\\"What color shirt are you wearing?\\") if shirt_color == \\"blue\\": print(\\"Touch your nose!\\") else: print(\\"Stomp your feet!\\") \`\`\` In this example, we first ask the user for the color of their shirt. We then use an if-else statement to check if their shirt color is blue. If it is, we tell them to touch their nose. If it's not, we tell them to stomp their feet. But what if there are more than two options? For example, what if Simon says \\"touch your nose if you're wearing a blue shirt, stomp your feet if you're wearing a red shirt, and do a dance if you're wearing any other color?\\" For this, we would use an elif statement, which is short for \\"else-if.\\" It's like another if statement, but it only runs if the previous condition(s) in the if-else chain were not met. Here's how we would update our code: \`\`\` shirt_color = input(\\"What color shirt are you wearing?\\") if shirt_color == \\"blue\\": print(\\"Touch your nose!\\") elif shirt_color == \\"red\\": print(\\"Stomp your feet!\\") else: print(\\"Do a dance!\\") \`\`\` In this new example, we first check if the shirt color is blue. If it is, we stick with the original instruction and tell them to touch their nose. If it's not blue, we move onto the next condition in the chain, which checks if the shirt color is red. If it is, we tell them to stomp their feet. If neither of these conditions are met, we move onto the final else statement, which means the shirt is any other color, and we ask them to do a dance."},{"instruction":"i am creating a layout for a context menu in kotlin, and it says it cannot resolve class item","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot see your code and the precise problem. However, here are some common solutions you can try out to resolve the \\"cannot resolve class item\\" issue in Kotlin: 1. Check if you have imported the correct libraries or classes at the beginning of your program. Make sure you have imported the necessary classes, including the 'item' class. 2. Check if the class 'item' is defined in your code and if it's spelled correctly. For instance, check if it is defined with an uppercase 'I', like 'Item'. 3. Restart your IDE and rebuild or clean your project. If you are using an IDE, you can try to restart it, and this can help the IDE pick up any changes you have made to your code. 4. Update your Kotlin version to the latest one available. Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by upgrading your Kotlin version to a higher one. 5. Double-check if you have declared the class 'item' in the right file. Ensure that it is in the proper file or in the class where you are trying to access it. If none of these workarounds helps fix the issue, please post more details on the code you're working on, including the exact code that's giving you the error."},{"instruction":"how do i create a resource file for a context menu?","output":"To create a resource file for a context menu in Kotlin, you can follow these basic steps: 1. Open the res folder in your project's directory in the Android Studio IDE. 2. Create a new folder called 'menu' within the res directory. 3. Right-click on the newly created 'menu' folder and click on 'New' > 'Menu Resource File' option. 4. In the 'New Menu Resource File' dialog box, give the file a name, such as 'context_menu.xml', and click on the 'Ok' button. 5. In the XML editor, define your context menu using the various attributes provided, such as 'id', 'title', 'icon', and 'showAsAction'. Here's an example of a simple context menu resource file: \`\`\` <?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?> <menu xmlns:android=\\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\\"> <item android:id=\\"@+id/edit\\" android:title=\\"Edit\\" /> <item android:id=\\"@+id/delete\\" android:title=\\"Delete\\" /> </menu> \`\`\` In the code, you can create an instance of the menu using the 'MenuInflater' class. Here's an example: \`\`\` override fun onCreateContextMenu(menu: ContextMenu, v: View, menuInfo: ContextMenu.ContextMenuInfo?) { super.onCreateContextMenu(menu, v, menuInfo) menuInflater.inflate(R.menu.context_menu, menu) } \`\`\` This creates a context menu from the 'context_menu.xml' resource file and inflates it.

We then remove the second element using the \`removeAt()\` method, passing its index (1) as an argument. Finally, we loop through the remaining elements in \`customList\` and print their properties. Note that if your custom class does not have an explicitly defined \`equals()\` and \`hashCode()\` method, then the \`removeAt()\` method will not work as expected.

When fetching data from a database, make sure that the Cursor object returned by the query contains at least one row of data, and that the Cursor object is positioned to the first row before accessing the column data. Here are a few things you can check to fix this error: 1. Check that the query you are using to fetch data from the database is valid and returns data. Try running the query manually in a SQLite editor or command-line tool to verify that it works. 2. Make sure that you are looping through the rows of the Cursor object returned by the query using a \`while\` loop and calling \`cursor.moveToFirst()\` before accessing the data: \`\`\` val cursor = db.query(TABLE_NAME, null, null, null, null, null, null) if (cursor.moveToFirst()) { do { // Access column data here } while (cursor.moveToNext()) } cursor.close() \`\`\` 3.

Entrepreneurs create new businesses, drive innovation, generate employment, and contribute to overall economic growth. In today's rapidly changing global landscape, the importance of cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset has never been more significant. Entrepreneurship education is a crucial catalyst for fostering this mindset, empowering individuals with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to identify and seize opportunities. This essay will argue that the cultivation of entrepreneurial thinking and the promotion of entrepreneurship education are essential components for succeeding in today's complex and highly competitive world. The Role of Entrepreneurship Education Entrepreneurship education provides individuals with the necessary tools to develop a comprehensive understanding of the business world and how it operates. It equips them with not just the knowledge, but also the practical skills required to successfully navigate the winds of change in a highly competitive environment. Some of the essential skills acquired by individuals through entrepreneurship education include problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, leadership, financial management, and negotiation. These skills are highly transferable and can be applied to various aspects of one's personal and professional life. The Changing Nature of the Economy and the Need for Entrepreneurship Education The global economy is undergoing a profound transformation driven by rapid technological advancements, the rise of the knowledge economy, and the shift from the traditional manufacturing-based industries to service-oriented sectors. This dynamic landscape has altered both job profiles and employment patterns worldwide, placing greater emphasis on adaptability and innovation. In this context, entrepreneurship education plays a vital role in equipping individuals with the skills to pivot and adapt to the ever-evolving market landscape. By fostering an entrepreneurial mindset, individuals are better prepared to identify new business opportunities, recognize emerging trends and technologies, and develop innovative products and services that meet the market's evolving needs. Job Creation and Social Impact of Entrepreneurship Education One of the most significant benefits of entrepreneurship education is its potential impact on job creation. In a world characterized by increasing unemployment rates, particularly among the youth, entrepreneurship education can provide a beacon of hope for those struggling to find a job in the traditional employment market. By equipping individuals with the required knowledge and skills, entrepreneurship education enables them to create their own businesses, thus generating employment opportunities not only for themselves but also others in their communities. Moreover, entrepreneurial ventures have the ability to address social issues and contribute to sustainable development. Many entrepreneurs, especially those in the social entrepreneurship sector, are focused on developing innovative solutions to societal challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. Entrepreneurship education, therefore, also plays a crucial role in enhancing the social impact of entrepreneurship and fostering a generation of socially responsible entrepreneurs who are committed to making a positive impact in their communities and the world at large. Enabling Innovation and Global Competitiveness Innovation is at the core of entrepreneurship, and it is through innovation that entrepreneurs derive a competitive advantage in today's digital and interconnected world.

As we move forward into an ever-evolving future, it is vital that individuals, educational institutions, and policymakers recognize the significance of promoting and supporting entrepreneurship education in order to drive sustainable economic growth and development."},{"instruction":"Research Synthesis on Entrepreneurship","output":"Title: Entrepreneurship Research Synthesis: Understanding the Drivers and Outcomes of Entrepreneurial Endeavors Introduction Over the last few decades, entrepreneurship has emerged as an essential catalyst for economic growth and development worldwide. Given its significance, a growing body of research has been dedicated to understanding the various factors that influence entrepreneurship and its outcomes. This research synthesis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurship by examining its drivers and key determinants, the role of entrepreneurial ecosystems, and the outcomes and impact of entrepreneurial endeavors on society. Drivers and Determinants of Entrepreneurship Existing research on entrepreneurship highlights a diverse range of factors that can influence an individual's decision to engage in entrepreneurial activities. These factors can be broadly classified into three categories: personal traits, environmental factors, and external influences. 1. Personal Traits: Research has identified several personal traits that contribute to an individual's propensity to pursue entrepreneurship. These traits include a high need for achievement, strong internal locus of control, risk-taking propensity, and self-confidence (Rauch & Frese, 2007). Additionally, past experiences, such as prior entrepreneurial experience, work experience in the relevant industry, and personal exposure to entrepreneurs within one's social network also play a significant role (Shane, 2003). 2. Environmental Factors: The economic, political, and socio-cultural environment within which individuals reside impacts their likelihood to engage in entrepreneurial activities. Favourable economic conditions, such as low unemployment rates, high GDP growth, and access to financial resources, can create a conducive environment for entrepreneurship (Aidis et al., 2008). Conversely, strict regulations, high entry barriers, and limited availability of resources can hinder entrepreneurial pursuits. 3. External Influences: The role of external influences, such as family, educational institutions, and government policies, has also been emphasized in entrepreneurship research. Supportive family members and social networks can facilitate entrepreneurial ventures by providing emotional, informational, and financial support (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003). Furthermore, educational institutions play a crucial role in imparting the necessary skills and knowledge to prospective entrepreneurs (Fayolle et al., 2006). Role of Entrepreneurial Ecosystems The concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems has been increasingly recognized as a key factor in fostering entrepreneurship. These ecosystems consist of interconnected actors, such as entrepreneurs, investors, large companies, universities, and government agencies, which create an environment that nurtures entrepreneurship and enables it to flourish (Stam, 2015). Studies have indicated that well-functioning entrepreneurial ecosystems can promote innovation, increase access to resources and networks, and ultimately contribute to the success and growth of new ventures (Isenberg, 2011). Outcomes and Impacts of Entrepreneurial Activity Entrepreneurial activity has been acknowledged to have a variety of outcomes and impacts, both at the individual and societal levels. At the individual level, entrepreneurship provides an opportunity for personal growth, autonomy, financial rewards, and job satisfaction (Shane, 2009). Societal outcomes include job creation, economic growth, and innovation, which can lead to an improved standard of living and overall prosperity (Wennekers & Thurik, 1999). Moreover, social entrepreneurship has emerged as a distinct form of entrepreneurship, where entrepreneurs endeavor to address social issues and contribute to community development (Mair & Marti, 2006). Conclusion The study of entrepreneurship has yielded valuable insights into the factors that drive individuals to pursue entrepreneurial ventures, the role of entrepreneurial ecosystems in fostering entrepreneurial activity, and the various outcomes that arise from entrepreneurship. Developing a comprehensive understanding of these factors can help policymakers and stakeholders design effective strategies to promote and nurture entrepreneurship, ultimately contributing to economic growth, job creation, and societal well-being. Future research should continue exploring the complex interrelationships among these factors and elucidate how different contexts shape entrepreneurial endeavors' trajectories and outcomes.

This research synthesis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing body of research on entrepreneurship education, focusing on key findings regarding teaching methods, program effectiveness, and implications for policy and practice. Teaching Methods and Approaches in Entrepreneurship Education Existing research on entrepreneurship education has emphasized the need for diverse, innovative, and experiential teaching methods to effectively foster an entrepreneurial mindset among students. Key teaching methods and approaches highlighted in the literature include: 1. Experiential Learning: Entrepreneurs learn best by engaging in real-world experiences and activities that allow them to develop essential entrepreneurial skills, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and adaptability. Experiential learning approaches, such as simulations, case studies, and business plan competitions, have been shown to significantly improve entrepreneurial skills and attitudes among students (Rae, 2006). 2. Action-Based Learning: Action-based learning models, such as project-based learning and entrepreneurship laboratory courses, emphasize learning by doing and allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to real-life entrepreneurial scenarios (Solomon, 2007). These approaches enable students to gain valuable practical insights, develop business ideas, and enhance their entrepreneurial self-efficacy. 3. Multidisciplinary Teaching: Entrepreneurship is inherently multidisciplinary, requiring knowledge and skills from various fields, such as finance, marketing, and technology. Research has emphasized the importance of incorporating a multidisciplinary perspective into entrepreneurship curricula, enabling students to draw on insights from diverse fields and develop holistic approaches to problem-solving and decision-making (Kuratko, 2005). Program Effectiveness and Impact on Students Studies evaluating the effectiveness and impact of entrepreneurship education programs have reported mixed results. However, there is a general consensus that entrepreneurship education positively influences students' entrepreneurial intentions, self-efficacy, and attitudes (Martin et al., 2013). Research has also highlighted that the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education programs is highly context-dependent, influenced by factors such as teaching methods, program design, regional culture, and the individual characteristics of students (Souitaris et al., 2007). Implications for Policy and Practice Based on the findings of existing research on entrepreneurship education, the following implications for policy and practice can be posited: 1. Collaborative Efforts: Developing effective entrepreneurship education programs require the collaboration and active engagement of various stakeholders, including educational institutions, government agencies, entrepreneurs, industry experts, and local communities. Policymakers must foster partnerships and communication channels among these stakeholders to enrich curricula, share resources, and maximize the impact of entrepreneurship education initiatives. 2. Context-Responsive Curriculum: Policymakers and educational institutions should prioritize designing entrepreneurship education programs that cater to the unique needs and characteristics of their particular regional and national contexts. This may involve incorporating local entrepreneurial success stories, focusing on context-specific challenges and opportunities, and considering the socio-cultural dimensions of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. 3. Professional Development and Training: Ensuring the quality and effectiveness of entrepreneurship education programs requires continuous professional development and training for educators. Policymakers must prioritize the development of comprehensive teacher training and support programs that allow educators to stay up-to-date with the latest trends, methodologies, and tools in entrepreneurship education. Conclusion The growing research on entrepreneurship education has provided valuable insights into effective teaching methods, program impact, and factors affecting program effectiveness. As we move forward, continued research should aim to further refine and contextualize our understanding of entrepreneurship education, identifying best practices for different cultural, economic, and educational settings. Policymakers and educational institutions must leverage these insights to design and implement entrepreneurship education programs that foster a vibrant entrepreneurial culture and contribute to sustainable economic growth and development.

Consequently, the demands on the education system have evolved, and there is a growing consensus that students need to develop a new set of skills to succeed in the increasingly complex and interconnected world. These skills, often referred to as 21st-century skills, encompass a wide range of knowledge, abilities, and attributes that go beyond traditional academic competencies. This essay will discuss the importance of 21st-century skills in education, outlining their role in fostering a holistic learning experience and preparing students for life beyond the classroom. Defining 21st Century Skills Although the concept of 21st-century skills can vary depending on the source, there is a general agreement that they encompass three broad categories: cognitive skills, interpersonal skills, and intrapersonal skills (Trilling & Fadel, 2009). 1. Cognitive Skills: These skills involve critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and innovation, which enable students to analyze complex situations, develop innovative ideas, and make well-informed decisions (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2019). These skills also include digital literacy, information literacy, and media literacy, which empower students to navigate the vast amounts of digital information and discern fact from fiction in the age of information overload. 2. Interpersonal Skills: These skills focus on communication, collaboration, and teamwork in diverse settings. As the workplace becomes more interconnected and global, students must be able to effectively communicate and collaborate with colleagues from varying cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives (Saavedra & Opfer, 2012). 3. Intrapersonal Skills: These skills encompass self-management, adaptability, resilience, and emotional intelligence. Developing these attributes allows students to effectively navigate challenges in their personal and professional lives, maintain well-being, and continue learning throughout life (Durlak et al., 2011). The Role of 21st Century Skills in Education Integrating 21st-century skills into the education system is imperative for several reasons: 1. Enhancing Student Engagement: The incorporation of 21st-century skills into curricula can help make learning more relevant and engaging for students by connecting abstract concepts with real-life applications. Project-based learning, for instance, fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity by encouraging students to develop solutions to real-world problems and challenges (Bell, 2010). 2. Preparing Students for the Workforce: As the nature of work continues to evolve due to technological advancements and globalization, the demand for workers with 21st-century skills has increased. By developing these skills in education, we equip students with the necessary tools to thrive in a rapidly changing and competitive job market (Autor et al., 2003). 3. Promoting Citizenship and Social Responsibility: Developing 21st-century skills, such as empathy, cross-cultural understanding, and media literacy, can foster responsible citizenship among students. These skills contribute to students' understanding of global issues, openness to diverse perspectives, and the ability to engage in informed and constructive discussions on social and political matters (Schulz et al., 2010). 4. Developing Lifelong Learners: In a rapidly changing world, individuals must be ready to adapt and learn continuously. Fostering skills like adaptability, resilience, and self-management helps students become lifelong learners who are prepared to navigate work and life transitions and pursue ongoing personal and professional development (Candy, 2002). Conclusion 21st-century skills play a vital role in equipping students with the knowledge, abilities, and attributes necessary to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. By integrating these skills into educational curricula, we can foster a more holistic learning experience that prepares students for life beyond the classroom, cultivates responsible citizenship, and encourages lifelong learning. Educational institutions, policymakers, and stakeholders must work collaboratively to develop and implement strategies to incorporate 21st-century skills into teaching and learning, ensuring that students are well-prepared for the future's challenges and opportunities.

Entrepreneurship education plays a significant role in equipping individuals with the mindset, knowledge, and skills necessary to create and manage successful ventures and contribute to economic growth. However, to achieve maximum impact, entrepreneurship education must also incorporate 21st century skills, which are essential for navigating the complexities of the modern world. This essay will discuss the importance of integrating 21st century skills into entrepreneurship education to prepare students for the challenges of the rapidly changing business landscape. The Interface of 21st Century Skills and Entrepreneurship Education 21st century skills encompass cognitive skills (such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving), interpersonal skills (such as communication, collaboration, and teamwork), and intrapersonal skills (such as self-management, adaptability, and emotional intelligence). These skills play a critical role in entrepreneurship education for the following reasons: 1. Enhancing Problem-Solving and Innovative Thinking: Entrepreneurs are often required to develop creative and practical solutions to complex challenges. The integration of cognitive skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving into entrepreneurship education enables students to think outside the box, analyze situations, and generate innovative ideas that can lead to successful ventures (Lackéus, 2015). 2. Facilitating Effective Communication and Collaboration: The exchange of ideas and information is integral to the entrepreneurial process. Interpersonal skills, such as communication, teamwork, and collaboration, enable entrepreneurs to work effectively with team members, investors, customers, and other stakeholders. Incorporating these skills into entrepreneurship education ensures that students can communicate their ideas persuasively, negotiate effectively, and establish strong networks to support their ventures (Brush et al., 2018). 3. Cultivating Resilience and Adaptability: Entrepreneurship often involves risk, uncertainty, and frequent changes. Intrapersonal skills like adaptability, resilience, and self-management help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, learn from failures, and adapt their strategies to respond to market conditions (Morris et al., 2013). Embedding these skills in entrepreneurship education can equip students with the psychological readiness to cope with the stresses of entrepreneurship and the ability to adjust to evolving environments. 4. Preparing for the Digital Age: The rapid advancement of technology and the growing importance of digital competency have transformed the way businesses operate. It is essential for entrepreneurship education to include digital literacy and other relevant cognitive skills to help students navigate the digital landscape, exploit new technologies for their ventures, and stay updated with industry trends (Kuratko, 2005). Implementing 21st Century Skills in Entrepreneurship Education To effectively integrate 21st century skills into entrepreneurship education, a holistic approach that balances theoretical learning with experiential and project-based learning is necessary. Some strategies for incorporating 21st century skills include: 1. Encourage hands-on learning experiences, such as business plan competitions, simulations, and internship opportunities, which provide students with real-world exposure and opportunities to apply their skills and knowledge. 2. Develop a multidisciplinary curriculum that incorporates subjects such as technology, innovation, social sciences, and humanities, allowing students to develop well-rounded perspectives and approaches to problem-solving. 3. Emphasize collaboration and teamwork in group projects, which can foster effective communication, negotiation, and networking abilities among students. 4. Provide opportunities for students to develop their emotional intelligence and resilience through mentorship, reflective exercises, and case studies that emphasize overcoming challenges and adapting to change. Conclusion The integration of 21st century skills into entrepreneurship education is essential for preparing students to succeed in the modern business landscape. By incorporating cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal skills into entrepreneurship curricula, educators can foster an entrepreneurial mindset that is adaptable, innovative, and resilient, equipping students to navigate the complexities of the global economy and contribute positively to society.

The test is about energy","output":"Sure! I'll do my best to help you with physics revision on energy at the GCSE level. Here are some key topics and concepts that you should know: 1. Forms of energy: There are many different forms of energy, including kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (energy stored in an object due to its position or state), thermal energy (energy due to the movement of particles in a substance), chemical energy (energy stored in bonds between atoms), and nuclear energy (energy released during nuclear reactions). 2. Conservation of energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This principle is known as the law of conservation of energy. 3. Energy transfer: Energy can be transferred from one object to another through various means, such as conduction, convection, or radiation. Examples include heat transfer from a hot stove to a pot of water, or light energy transferring from the sun to plants through photosynthesis. 4. Power: Power is the rate at which energy is transferred or used. It is measured in watts (W) and is calculated by dividing energy by time. For example, if a light bulb uses 100 joules of energy in 10 seconds, its power output would be 10 watts. 5. Energy efficiency: This refers to the amount of energy that is actually used for a particular purpose, compared to the amount of energy that is wasted. Efficient devices use less energy to accomplish the same task, allowing for cost savings and reduced environmental impact. 6. Renewable vs. nonrenewable energy sources: Renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, are sources that can be replenished naturally and are therefore considered sustainable. Nonrenewable energy sources, such as fossil fuels, are finite and will eventually run out. To prepare for your energy test, try practicing problems that relate to calculating energy, power, and energy efficiency. Also make sure to review the different forms of energy, as well as the principles of conservation of energy and energy transfer. Best of luck!"},{"instruction":"Thanks","output":"You're welcome! If you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask."},{"instruction":"Can you do m,ore energy revision for physics please","output":"Sure, I can provide some more physics revision on energy. Here are some additional concepts and calculations that you may need to know: 7. Potential energy calculations: Potential energy is calculated by multiplying an object's mass, gravitational field strength (which is 10 N/kg on Earth), and height. The equation is: potential energy = mass x gravitational field strength x height, or PE = mgh. 8. Kinetic energy calculations: Kinetic energy is calculated by multiplying an object's mass and velocity squared, and then dividing by 2. The equation is: kinetic energy = (1/2)mv^2. 9. Work done: Work done is the transfer of energy that results from a force acting over a distance. It is calculated by multiplying the force by the distance moved in the direction of the force. The equation is: work done = force x distance, or W = Fd. 10. Elastic potential energy: Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an object when it is stretched or compressed. It is calculated by multiplying the spring constant (a measure of stiffness) by the square of the extension or compression. The equation is: elastic potential energy = (1/2)kx^2. 11. Efficiency calculations: Energy efficiency is calculated by dividing the useful output energy by the total input energy, and multiplying by 100% to get a percentage. The equation is: efficiency = (useful output energy / total input energy) x 100%. These are just a few more concepts and calculations that you may encounter on an energy test in physics. Make sure to also review any specific formulas, units, or definitions that your teacher has provided, and practice applying these concepts to problem-solving questions.

The system is grounded on the concept of Hiragana, which translates to \\"Humans first,\\" which means the company puts the interests of its employees first before any other consideration. This approach is based on the belief that a happy and stable workforce leads to greater productivity and profitability in the long run. The Japanese Personnel Management System has received worldwide attention and admiration due to its successful implementation and positive effect on the Japanese economy. However, it has also been criticized by some for its lack of flexibility and failure to adapt to changing business needs in the modern world. Nonetheless, the system remains a matter of pride for Japanese companies and a fundamental aspect of Japanese corporate culture."},{"instruction":"give me detail introduction on Japanese Personnel Management System with reference","output":"The Japanese Personnel Management System, also known as the lifetime employment system or the Japanese HRM system, has been a defining characteristic of the Japanese economy since after World War II. It is grounded in the idea of \\"Hiragana,\\" meaning \\"people first,\\" which implies that employees are central to the success of an organization [1]. The system emphasizes long-term employment, where workers will typically join a company after graduating from university and remain with the company for their entire working life [2]. This practice creates a sense of lifetime job security and a commitment to the organization fostering employee loyalty. The Japanese Personal Management System focuses on the holistic approach of employee development, taking care of the employees in various dimensions, such as career development, training, and work-life balance, to foster a sense of belonging resulting in a long-lasting employee-employer relationship [3]. The system also values collective decision-making whereby management is encouraged to consult employees when making decisions, leading to strong team cohesion, and harmonious work environments. Moreover, unions are an essential component of the Japanese personnel management system, collaborating with management to achieve employee satisfaction and company goals[4]. Japanese companies also offer job rotation, where employees are given the opportunity to work in different departments, understanding and learning other fields, which builds a sense of inter-organizational knowledge and promotes flexibility. Additionally, the development of company loyal employees is also achieved using effective communication channels; whereby workers receive feedback from supervisors and managers on their performance [5]. The Japanese Personnel Management System has been credited with Japan's economic success over the years, but it has also come under criticism for being rigid and resistant to change in the current fast-paced global business environment [6]. Nonetheless, the Japanese Personnel Management System remains a fundamental aspect of Japanese corporate culture and continues to inspire studies and other economies. References: 1.

It is a unique practice whereby Japanese companies provide job security to their employees by offering them a job for life. This means that employees are expected to join the company after graduating from university and are guaranteed employment until their retirement [1]. The practice of lifetime employment has its roots in the economic, social, and cultural history of Japan. After World War II, Japan's economy was in shambles, and the country found itself with limited natural resources. In response, companies realized that they needed to create a loyal and committed workforce to achieve economic recovery. Hence, the lifetime employment system was born as a means of securing the loyalty of employees [2]. One of the benefits of lifetime employment is that it creates a stable and motivated workforce. Employees who work for the same company for their entire lives are more likely to be loyal, committed, and satisfied with their jobs. This practice also fosters a sense of belonging and loyalty to the company, creating a strong sense of job security. Furthermore, Japanese companies invest heavily in their employees through training and development programs, as they expect to keep them on board for a long time. These training and development programs not only sharpen the skills of employees but also allow them to adjust to the changes in the business environment, and as such, Japanese companies have a highly qualified and skilled workforce [3]. Despite these benefits, the lifetime employment system is not without its criticisms and challenges. For one, it can be rigid, making it difficult for companies to adjust to changes in the market. This lifestyle also puts considerable pressure on the workers, who may feel that they have little career mobility and flexibility in terms of their working arrangements. In conclusion, lifetime employment is a unique feature of the Japanese Personnel Management System that has served as a cornerstone for Japan's economic and social stability. While the system is not perfect and faces many challenges, it remains a fundamental aspect of Japanese corporate culture and continues to inspire studies and analysis [4]. References: 1. Davis, A. L.

We can use the formula for exponential decay to write an equation that models this situation: N(t) = N0 * (1 - r)^t where: - N(t) is the size of the population at time t - N0 is the initial population size - r is the decay rate (measured as a fraction) - t is the time elapsed (measured in some fixed unit, e.g. years) In this case, we are given that the initial population size is 320 rabbits, so N0 = 320. The population declines by 20% each winter, which means that the decay rate (r) is 0.2. We can plug these values into the formula to get: N(t) = 320 * (1 - 0.2)^t Simplifying: N(t) = 320 * 0.8^t This equation models the exponential decay of the rabbit population in the field due to fox predation, where N(t) is the size of the population t winter seasons after the initial population of 320. To find how many years it will take for the rabbit population to decline to less than 84, we can set N(t) to 84 and solve for t: 84 = 320 * 0.8^t Dividing both sides by 320: 0.2625 = 0.8^t Taking the logarithm (base 0.8) of both sides: t = log base 0.8 (0.2625) Using the change-of-base formula for logarithms: t = log base 10 (0.2625) / log base 10 (0.8) Using a calculator: t ≈ 9.55 Therefore, it will take approximately 9.55 winter seasons for the rabbit population to decline to less than 84 in the field."},{"instruction":"solve log base x+1 81 =2","output":"We can begin by using the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation as an exponential equation: x + 1)^2 = 81 Taking the square root of both sides: x + 1 = ± 9 Solving for x in each case: When x + 1 = 9: x = 8 When x + 1 = -9: x = -10 However, we cannot have a negative base for a logarithm, so the only valid solution is: x = 8 Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the given equation is 8."},{"instruction":"solve 3^x = 1/9","output":"We can solve this exponential equation by taking logarithms of both sides: x log base 3 (3) = log base 3 (1/9) simplifying the left side: x = log base 3 (1/9) / log base 3 (3) Since log base 3 (3) = 1: x = log base 3 (1/9) Using the change-of-base formula for logarithms: x = log base 10 (1/9) / log base 10 (3) Using a calculator: x ≈ -2.185 Therefore, x is approximately equal to -2.185."},{"instruction":"detail on Lifetime Employment of Japanese Personnel Management System with reference","output":"to its advantages and disadvantages The concept of Lifetime Employment is a unique feature of the Japanese personnel management system. This system has been an integral part of Japanese organizational culture for decades and has attracted the attention of many researchers and practitioners worldwide. In this system, employees are recruited directly from college or high school and are expected to remain with the same organization until they retire. Advantages of Lifetime Employment System: 1. Job security: The system provides a sense of job security to employees, and they are assured that they will not be laid off or face abrupt termination. 2. Loyalty: The system fosters a sense of loyalty to the organization, and employees are committed to working for the betterment of the company. 3. Long-term planning: Companies can plan strategically for the future, knowing that they have a stable and loyal workforce. 4. Employee development: Organizations invest in their employees' training and development, resulting in the development of a highly skilled workforce. 5. High productivity: The system is known for improving productivity, quality, and innovation, leading to higher profitability. Disadvantages of Lifetime Employment System: 1. Lack of diversity: The system limits diversity, and people from different backgrounds and experiences may not be recruited, leading to a lack of fresh ideas and perspectives. 2. Rigidity: The system can create a rigid organizational culture where it is challenging to change practices or adapt to changing market conditions. 3. High cost: The cost of employee training and development is high and places a considerable burden on organizations. 4. Inefficiency: The system can lead to inefficiencies, such as overstaffing or the continued retention of underperforming employees. 5. Limited mobility: Employees have limited mobility and can find it challenging to change jobs or move to different organizations. Conclusion: The Lifetime Employment System has its advantages and disadvantages. Although it has been successful in the Japanese organizational context, it may not be applicable universally. Companies need to consider their specific business needs, culture, and labor market conditions before implementing this system. It is essential to balance the benefits of job security, high employee loyalty, and productivity with the system's costs and limitations."},{"instruction":"\\"If the interest rate is 14% per year compounded Weekley, the effective interest rate per quarter is closest to","output":"15.02% To find the effective interest rate per quarter, we first need to find the weekly interest rate. We can use the formula: Effective annual rate = (1 + Annual interest rate / Number of compounding periods) ^ Number of compounding periods - 1 In this case, the annual interest rate is 14% and there are 52 compounding periods (weeks) in a year. Therefore, the weekly interest rate is: Weekly interest rate = (1 + 0.14 / 52) ^ 52 - 1 = 0.1462 or 14.62% Next, we need to find the effective interest rate per quarter by compounding the weekly rate over 13 weeks (a quarter). We can use the same formula as above, but with a different number of compounding periods: Effective quarterly rate = (1 + Weekly interest rate / Number of compounding periods) ^ Number of compounding periods - 1 Plugging in the numbers, we get: Effective quarterly rate = (1 + 0.1462 / 13) ^ 13 - 1 = 0.1502 or 15.02% Therefore, the effective interest rate per quarter is closest to 15.02%."},{"instruction":"You deposited 1,000 now in a saving account, the interest rate is 12% per year compounded monthly.

This man was Lord Cedric Blackthorn, defender of the Sapphire Kingdom. One fateful day, Lord Blackthorn and his battalion ventured forth on a daring escapade, to plunder the ancient and hidden relics of a forgotten dungeon. They trekked through sun-scorched deserts and valleys of desolation, their spirits unfazed in their pursuit for treasure. As they entered the darkness of the dungeon, memories of their past victories echoed within their hearts, for they were, without doubt, victors of wars. Upon reaching the threshold of the secret chamber, the walls were adorned with runes of old, offering ritual obeisance to an ancient force. And there, in the center of the room lay a crystal of midnight hue, its raven beauty reflecting a darkness untamed. Overwhelmed by the allure of the rare stone, Lord Blackthorn reached out to touch it. In that fateful instant, the chamber came alive with an eerie glow, as the surrounding runes whispered untold curses upon the assembled warriors. As their newfound cursed lives began, the soldiers let out cries of despair as their bodies began to change in unimaginable ways. For Lord Blackthorn, his fate was stranger still. The chiseled visage and broad shoulders which had defined him as a man of war had vanished, replaced by silken tresses and a visage of ethereal beauty. Slowly, he realized that the curse had robbed him of something more than his humanity—that which had once made him a man. A woman now stood in his place, the very embodiment of grace one might find in a field of wildflowers. Shaken by this unexpected turn of events, Lady Cedrica Blackthorn could not but yearn for a cure as she stumbled from the chamber of the arcane and hallowed whispers. The need to return to familiarity—to the life that had once been hers—consumed her every thought. With a fire burning in her chest, she called on her trusted soldiers, told them of her plight, and vowed to lead them in a search for a cure to this maddening hex. Yet when they returned to the battlefield, they found that Lady Cedrica's new form offered her talents and abilities previously unknown to her. Gone was the hard-hearted and aggressive tactician that was Lord Blackthorn. Instead, as though divine providence had laid its hand upon her brow, the woman who now held his place seemed to wield an instinct that transcended the act of war. The subtleties of strategy and the dance of diplomacy flowed from her like whispers from a masterful poet. Lady Cedrica Blackthorn found that her soldiers, no longer driven by fear of their commander, instead sought to emulate the newfound harmony their leader emanated. They moved as one, a single body entwined in the symphony of war. As the moon traced her path through the heavens, Lady Cedrica found within herself a power more formidable than any sword, a wisdom culled from the depths of her very soul. She observed the change, and knew with certainty that her newfound femininity had brought with it a guiding force that elevated her to an echelon reserved for the greatest of generals. And slowly, the yearning for a cure began to fade, replaced by the nurturing of this newfound understanding. In the days that followed, as victory after victory lay across the path like a carpet woven of triumph, Lady Cedrica Blackthorn embraced her fate and the curse that had led her there. And she, and all her soldiers, knew without a shadow of doubt that they would not trade the sage guiding them now for the wrathful commander they had once known. For in her heart, the curse had created not only a woman but the greatest commander the realm of Arganor had ever seen."},{"instruction":"Write a sequel where her soldiers help her discover the pleasures of being a woman","output":"In the days that followed Lady Cedrica Blackthorn's metamorphosis, her soldiers found themselves flourishing under her guidance, and the Sapphire Kingdom began to blossom into an equilibrium that had once seemed unattainable. Lady Cedrica's dedication to her people was unconditional, yet her nights were haunted by pensive thoughts as the weight of her new reality became heavier with each passing day. Her soldiers, who had once trembled under the iron grip of Lord Blackthorn, discovered their loyalty deepening for the commander, who had unwittingly taught them not only the art of war but the power of empathy. Realizing that their commander was struggling to navigate her newfound femininity, the soldiers decided to band together in secrecy to help her embrace her situation. They all knew that helping Lady Cedrica would only serve to strengthen their cause, and so they began a selfless quest to bring warmth and comfort into her life. Led by Lianna, the captain of the guard, they slowly assembled a network of women from throughout the kingdom - seamstresses who shared their wisdom in the creation of delicate garments, dancers who taught Lady Cedrica the enchanting language of movement, and bards who shared timeless tales to help her discover the deep well of strength and passion hidden within her. Lianna approached Lady Cedrica with this ragtag group of mentors to present her with a side to womanhood she had never known. Hesitant at first, Lady Cedrica took in the kindness and warmth radiating from her fellow women, and soon began to embrace their offering. As her friendships blossomed, she found her whole being transformed, for the pleasures of being a woman were laid out before her like a verdant meadow. She reveled in the laughter of children and the soulful bonds that connected this sisterhood. And in turn, they found solace in the guiding force she provided, her wisdom drawing them in like moths to a flame. Perhaps the most potent pleasure that arose from this metamorphosis was Lady Cedrica's newfound connection with Thiana - an apothecary and healer, whose touch was as delicate as the petals of a rose. They would walk together through moonlit gardens, their conversations weaving through the tapestry of life. The potency of emotion and passion held within Lady Cedrica's being found solace and comfort in the arms of Thiana, igniting a love untamed - a force that bound them together with an unyielding vigor. And so it was, as the years passed, that Lady Cedrica Blackthorn fully embraced her destiny as the foremost commander and defender of the Sapphire Kingdom. Her life was filled not only with the thunder of war, but also the sweet nectar of a woman's love for her fellow sisters. With her soldiers and her people at her side, the Sapphire Kingdom continued to thrive, an unshakeable force that knew no walls nor boundaries. And as she sat upon her throne, her armor glinting beneath the twilight sky, Lady Cedrica Blackthorn couldn't help but feel grateful for the curse which had opened the door to an existence she had never fathomed. For in the myriad of emotions and experiences she embraced, Lady Cedrica was given the greatest gift of all - the gift of life, in all its tumultuous and harmonious glories, allowed her to etch upon the annals of history the indelible mark of a woman who had found herself and risen to become an eternal legend."},{"instruction":"redacta en email en japones formal para explicar que ya termine de traducir el documento y que esta adjunto en este email","output":"件名：文書翻訳の完了のお知らせ 尊敬する〇〇様 いつもお世話になっております。私は〇〇と申します。この度は、文書翻訳の作業を担当させていただきました。 ご連絡いただいた内容について、翻訳作業を行いました。翻訳作業は無事完了しましたので、このメールに文書を添付いたします。ご確認いただき、何か問題がございましたらお知らせください。 なお、今回の翻訳作業は大変に責任あるものであり、十分な確認作業を行いました。何か問題がございましたら、都度修正いたしますのでお知らせください。 この度は、私を選んでいただきましてありがとうございました。今後とも、よろしくお願いいたします。 敬具 〇〇"},{"instruction":"traduce esto a espa;ol 件名：翻訳文書の添付について 尊敬する〇〇〇様 お世話になっております。私が先日ご依頼いただいた翻訳文書の翻訳が完了いたしましたので、このメールに添付いたしました。 内容につきましては、精確な翻訳を心掛けさせていただきました。何か不明な点などございましたら、遠慮なくご連絡ください。 引き続きよろしくお願いいたします。 敬具 〇〇〇より","output":"Asunto: Adjunto de documento traducido Estimado/a [Nombre del destinatario], Espero que se encuentre bien.

Layers are individual files that store changes to an image. Each change creates a new layer. By using layers, you can reuse images and reduce the size of your final container image. Here are the steps to use layers in Docker: 1. Write a Dockerfile in which you define the steps to build your application. For example: \`\`\` FROM ubuntu:latest RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip ADD . /app WORKDIR /app RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt CMD [\\"python3\\", \\"app.py\\"] \`\`\` 2. Build the Dockerfile using the \`docker build\` command. Each step in the Dockerfile creates a new layer. For example: \`\`\` docker build -t my-app . Sending build context to Docker daemon 134.7kB Step 1/5 : FROM ubuntu:latest ---> 6255b6e9deb3 Step 2/5 : RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip ---> Using cache ---> 18291e420ae8 Step 3/5 : ADD . /app ---> 7f9ebcdde5bf Step 4/5 : WORKDIR /app ---> Running in d5a921591e93 Removing intermediate container d5a921591e93 ---> 33283d1d42b6 Step 5/5 : RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt ---> Running in bcca66a414b4 Removing intermediate container bcca66a414b4 ---> 5cad7d5a0586 Successfully built 5cad7d5a0586 Successfully tagged my-app:latest \`\`\` 3. Run the container using the \`docker run\` command: \`\`\` docker run my-app \`\`\` By using layers in Docker, you can optimize your container images and make them more efficient. Layers also make it easier to share and distribute container images."},{"instruction":"paint me kindle paperwhite","output":"As an AI, I am unable to physically paint objects. However, I can recommend some ways you can personalize or customize your Kindle Paperwhite: 1. Purchase a decorative case or cover: You can find many cases with various designs, colors, and themes that can be an expression of your personality. 2. Get a decal or skin: You can buy reusable vinyl skins, which are like big stickers, that you can apply to your Kindle Paperwhite. These decals or skins are easily removable and allow you to change the look of your device without damaging it. 3. DIY painting: If you're feeling creative and brave, you could try painting your Kindle Paperwhite yourself. Start by carefully disassembling the device and removing the internal components. Once you have the casing, you can use acrylic paint or spray paint to create your design. Be sure to let the paint dry completely and add a clear sealant to protect the surface before reassembling the device. 4. Commission an artist: If you're looking for a one-of-a-kind design, consider hiring an artist to create a custom piece for you. You could provide them with your preferences for color, style, and themes, and they could design a unique piece for your device.

Nobody really knows what caused there to be a size difference between macros and micros. One thing we know is that it didn’t always used to be like this. There were no over-sized plants and vegetation that destroyed houses with their roots and vines, there were no insects that could grow to the size of a compact car, and there were definitely no macro furries that delighted in hunted down and swallowing their smaller cousins whole. This, however, was all before the rise of the macros. As you can imagine, there was a great deal of confusion when one day regular furries, animals, and plants rapidly began to grow to many times their original size whereas the anthropomorphic mammals remained at their normal sizes. At first, there seemed to be at least some form of cooperation between the two groups as they tried to repair the damage that had been done. However, the giants soon started to give up on the idea that the two groups could ever be considered equal. This was largely due to the fact that an average adult-sized micro was only about three inches tall when compared to one of the massive giants. Micros were crushed beneath the macro’s feet without a second glance (sometimes intentionally) as the giants trudged about their daily lives. Some micros gathered together and fled to remote locations away from most of the dangers that they faced. This didn’t protect them from everything however. No matter where they went, there was always something big that had it’s eye on them. Even if there were no macrofurries around, micros found themselves being eaten alive by the animals that had grown on that day as well. Several years passed after the rise of the macros, and for the micros, things only became worse. Macros on the other hand had used that time to build the beginnings of fully macro-sized towns and cities where they could live normal lives again. Ash was an anthropomorphic pardinensis cheetah, a very rare species, he was a micro. He was slim and muscular with a long and thin tail and a short grey fur with darker spots, his short sleek fur was letting see the chiseled details of his muscles. He was also quite intelligent, but perhaps not as much as he thought to be. He despised the other micros who chose to live as far possible from the towering macros and their cities. He was living in their gigantic houses, hiding under their building seized pieces of furniture of in the holes in their walls. But one day he was captured and sold to a macro. When the box was finally opened and Ash was brought out, he was met with the sight of a towering anthro jaguar. The massively muscular jaguar grinned down at him, his sharp teeth glinting in the light. “Well, well, well,” the jaguar said with a chuckle. “Looks like I won myself a tasty little snack.” Ash shuddered in fear as the jaguar lifted him up, examining him closely. The jaguar smirked as he examined the body of the comparatively diminutive cheetah. “Fine, you seem to have endured the travel quite well. I bought that cage for you, I hope you will find it large enough. From the description on the auction site you’re a freshly caught wild micro. I assume you’re not used to restrained space, but you have to get used to it.” He chuckled and put Ash in the cage. He closed the door of the enclosure just after. “I can’t wait to have some fun with you, but it’s better to let you have some rest to chill out a bit.” Then the jaguar moved on his couch to watch TV, time to time he cast a glance at the cage and his tiny occupant from his seat. Some time later he moved to his bedroom to sleep for the night. The jaguar came back at the end of the day. He brought several grocery sacks and put them in his kitchen. “I thought about eating you first, but you’re so tiny you would not even fill one tenth of my belly.” He said with a chuckle. Some time later he come back with a dinner TV for carnivores adapted to his enormous size. He reached in the cage for the cheetah. Ash tried to avoid to be grabbed and managed to stay out of the reach of the humongous jaguar paw like hand as he was holding his dinner TV with his other hand at the same time, but the giant managed to seize the cheetah diminutive body eventually. “Don’t make your difficult to get !” Said the jaguar with the same chuckle. He then moved to his couch and sat heavily, the couch creaking under the thousands of tons of his weight. He then put the cheetah on the rim of the tray of his dinner TV. “Several kinds of meat. Beef, chicken, fish, and caiman, my favorite !” He said. “You can take some, it’s not your appetite that will make a difference.” He switched his TV on and searched for something interesting with his remote while taking some bit of food time to time. “Ah, by the way, my name is Lance. But you have to call me Master.” He snickered. “Or, if you feel like being a good pet, Daddy.” He laughed. One day, when Lance was engrossed in a particularly loud show on television, Ash seized his chance. He quietly slid out of his cage and onto the floor, careful to avoid any creaking or telltale sounds. Using his memory of the house layout and the cacophony of the TV, he stealthily made his way towards the window that he had observed Lance often leaving open. Ash’s heart pounded as he reached the window, with each passing second a potential for Lance to notice him. With one final act of defiance against his captor, he climbed up the curtain and leapt out into the open air, finally free. As he made his way through the grass that seemed like a jungle, he knew that he had a long journey ahead of him. Unknown of Ash, Lance was well aware about his position, as by security the giant jaguar put a microchip and GPS device in the collar he put around the neck of his expensive micro anthro cheetah. Lance followed the moving of his pet on his car sized smartphone as an app what giving him the position of Ash on a map. And some hours later the jaguar resounding steps come close of the hideout of Ash. “Ash ? I know you’re here. Move out of your hiding place.” The giant waited some seconds. “You know it’s dangerous for you to be in the streets. Critters are big here, they will eat you. And there are other macros too, all of them won’t try to catch you to keep you as a pet. So come with me. You will be safe in my home. I won’t punish you very hard for this time.” Ash’s heart sank as he heard Lance’s intimidating voice. He knew that there was no denying the giant’s presence, but he was determined to make a final attempt to escape. From his hiding place, he quickly formed a plan. Taking advantage of the giant’s momentary distraction, he bolted from his hiding place, running as fast as his legs could carry him, away from Lance. The jaguar gave an annoyed grunt and pursued Ash, his massive strides closing the distance between them frighteningly quickly. In the midst of their chase, Ash recalled a large sewer drain he had discovered earlier during his exploration. Deftly, the micro cheetah made a sudden turn, darting into the drain and disappearing from Lance’s sight. The giant jaguar cursed under his breath, realizing that he couldn’t fit into the small space. He knelt down, attempting to reach into the drain with his massive paw, but Ash was too fast and had already scrambled further into the darkness. Lance growled lowly, frustrated at losing his prized pet. He briefly considered calling off the chase and letting Ash make his own way in this harsh world, but the investment in the micro cheetah and his curiosity about whether Ash’s resourcefulness could be put to better use got the better of him. The giant jaguar decided his next move - he’d take a different tactic. Anticipating the path of the sewers, Lance hurried towards another exit, where he would attempt to recapture Ash quietly and seemingly without effort. A macro centipede was hiding in the sewer. It was easily four time longer than Ash and about the length of Lance’s forearm. The cheetah inadvertently knocked one of the long antennas of the invertebrate. The centipede became active and started to run after the cheetah. Ash, as a former wild micro before being captured, was used to cross the way of some macro critters, but the place where he lived before being sold to Lance was more in the north of the country in a cooler climate and insects were not as big, even the macro ones. That centipede was looking like a monster for the cheetah who was running with terror. Ash burst out of the sewer and didn’t even noticed Lance waiting for him. The centipede hurtled out of the sewer pursuing his tiny prey. Lance quickly realized the danger posed to his tiny prize and jumped into action. With an impressive display of strength and agility, he caught the large centipede just as it was about to sink its venomous pincers into the panicked cheetah. He crushed the giant invertebrate without hesitation, its many legs twitching one last time before going completely limp. Ash, still in a state of panic, finally noticed Lance standing above him. The skyscraper jaguar had saved him, and though Ash was desperate to escape captivity, he couldn’t help but feel a strange, begrudging gratitude toward Lance. The jaguar offered a massive paw to Ash, smirking. “Now do you see why I told you it’s a dangerous world out there? You can stay with me, and I can keep you safe from creatures like that. Or you can go back out there alone, and take your chances with the countless other predators lurking in the shadows.” Ash hesitated, torn between his desire for freedom and his newfound understanding of the true dangers faced by someone in his situation. He glanced back at the sewer entrance, shuddering at the memory of the terrifying macro centipede. Reluctantly, he climbed into Lance’s outstretched palm, knowing that, for the moment, his best chance at survival was to accept the giant’s “protection”. As they walked back to Lance’s home, Ash wondered if he could ever change the dynamic of their relationship, and perhaps one day regain his freedom without sacrificing his safety. Lance washed Ash meticulously as his escapade made the micro ran through a sewer. And the giant checked the diminutive anthro feline body to see if he had been hurt. Then he put him back in his cage and took care to close the door of the enclosure. Later in that same day, Lance gently seized Ash in his massive hand and moved to his couch. He had another of these enormous dinner TV for macro carnivores and he offered some bits of meat to Ash. Ash was about to eat one of them when he noticed something different. Lance didn’t switch the TV on yet. He put the morsel back on the rim of the gigantic tray and looked up at Lance. The giant anthropomorphic jaguar was looking down at him, his face was looking more serious than his usual jovial appearance. “Well, Ash. I said I won’t punish you hard too much for your escape. But, you made me search for you for hours and you might have been killed by that bug by a narrow margin.” He approached his humongous hand from the cheetah and stretched his forefinger out and gently petted the comparatively tiny body of the micro. “I know you’re a former wild micro with some age and you are not used to be captive. I wanted a pet who had some life before, I was thinking it would be more interesting. But I’m wondering if I should not have bought a micro from farming and already tamed and domesticated.” He moved his hand away. “Well, about that punishment, I wonder what you’re thinking of it ? And how I should punish you for your escapade ?” Ash hesitated for a moment, considering his response carefully. He knew that Lance held all the power in this situation, and that any defiance could be met with disastrous consequences. However, he couldn’t deny the fact that he was grateful for the giant’s intervention with the centipede. “Master,” Ash began hesitantly, “I understand that I caused you concern and trouble with my escape attempt, and I understand the need for a punishment in this situation. I know that the world is dangerous for a micro like me, and you saved my life today. I appreciate that, and I will do my best to be a good pet and companion to you.” Lance raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised by the sincerity in Ash’s words. It seemed that their previous encounter had affected him more than he had thought. “As for my punishment, I leave that decision in your capable hands, Master. However, I ask that you consider the fact that, despite everything, part of me still yearns for the wilds as it is where I spent most of my life. Maybe you can take that into account when deciding an appropriate punishment,” Ash finished, his voice barely above a whisper. Lance looked down at Ash pensively, genuinely considering the cheetah’s words. After a few moments, he nodded slowly. “Very well, Ash. I appreciate your honesty and understanding of the situation. As for your punishment, I will think on it and find something that is both fair and takes into consideration your wild instincts.” With that, Lance finally switched on the TV, and the remainder of the evening was spent with the giant and the tiny cheetah sharing a meal together. And although the weight of the impending punishment loomed over Ash, there was an undeniable sense of camaraderie between the two that had been strengthened by the day’s events. In a way, their unique relationship was evolving, forming a new bond that neither Ash nor Lance could have anticipated. Lance seized the cheetah between his massive fingers. “By the way Ash, I’m wondering, how old are you exactly ?” Ash hesitated, it was obvious Lance was a yound adult, but the cheetah was certain to be older. “So, how old ?” Insisted Lance. “44.” Replied the cheetah with embarrassement. Lance smirked and chuckled. “Well I’m 25. But I like the idea to have a pet older than me a lot, it’s also for that reason I chose you on that auction site. But you still have to call me Master, or what you already know.” Ash bristled slightly at the jaguar’s amusement at their age difference, but he knew better than to provoke Lance any further. With a reluctant sigh, he nodded in acceptance. “Yes, Master,” he replied, doing his best to swallow his pride. The colossal jaguar barely looked at Ash when he left the next morning. The cheetah passed the day locked in his cage till the jaguar came back. The giant opened the door of the cage. “You can go out of your cage if you wish to stretch your legs, but remember : no escape and you come if I call you, Ash.“ He was going to move in an other room when he stopped abruptly. He moved a small cardboard box from his pocket. He opened it, it contained a tinny ball, a futon scaled for a micro with some pillows and blankets. He put them in the cage. “For you, I guess you would like it. As a wild micro you should not be used to use a bed like that, but I think you need a more comfortable enclosure. Consider your cage as your own house.” His massive and muscular form towered above the cage again as he stood up and groped for another thing in his pocket. “I bought that too.” He said while showing a device looking like a metallic pen scaled to the immense size of the jaguar, so easily twice the length of the cheetah and probably weighing more than one ton. He pressed a switch and a bright spot of green colored light appeared on the floor in the direction the jaguar pointed it. “A laser pointer,” he said with an amused smile, \\"I’m sure you would enjoy playing this way. But not right now, I have some chores to finish.” He put the pointer on a shelf several hundreds feet above the floor. “By the way, I have not forgotten about your punishment. So don’t do anything that would worsen your situation.” He added with a chuckle before he moved out of the room. Ash couldn’t help but feel grateful for the kindness Lance had shown, despite his earlier transgressions. The items provided for his comfort and potential playing marked a significant change in the giant’s attitude towards him, and perhaps even a softening of his heart. Despite their newfound bond, Ash couldn’t ignore the lingering dread regarding the punishment he was still yet to face. He occupied himself within his enclosure, making a cozy nest for himself with the small futon, pillows, and blankets, and contemplated Lance’s motivations for the newfound generosity. Finally, next week, the day Ash had been dreading arrived. Lance entered the room with a solemn expression. “Ash,” he began, his voice carrying a seriousness that had not been present before. “It’s time for your punishment.” The giant looked down at Ash. “To start with : Heel !” He waited. “You have to come to me each time I call you this way, without any discussion.” He waited watching down the hesitant grey furred cheetah. “Heel !” His deep voice rumbled again. Ash moved with hesitation but came toward Lance. The colossus bent down and reached for the cheetah. “Good. But next time, you’d better don’t make me wait.” Lance checked the collar of his pet and his app on his smart phone. “Perfect, it’s working. Well, how do you have to call me ?” Ash looked back at the young giant and even though he was wondering why he acted this way he replied : “Master.” “Fine,” replied Lance, “I expect you to only call me this way tonight. Remember it well !” The massive musclebound jaguar looked down at his cheetah he was holding in his hand. “I registered you for a competition. It will be a race of micro cheetahs. You’ll have to run for me. I expect you to behave properly and to obey every command I give you without question.” “I’m not trained Master, I won’t win.” Replied Ash. “I don’t expect you to have the same result a properly trained cheetah, but you have a chance to show me what you can do.” Lance saw his pet was looking stressed. “Don’t worry and relax. You’ll make me proud if you behave properly. If you do, consider your punishment lifted.” “There will be other macros ?” Asked Ash. “Yes, we will be several dozens, probably. But don’t panic, only me will handle you.” “Please Master, find another punishment !” Pleaded the cheetah. “Nope, it’s too late now. I registered, and you will go.” Replied Lance. The giant jaguar brought Ash in his bedroom and put him down on the top of his desk. He seized a small box in a drawer and opened it in front of the micro. “You’ll wear this.” He said while presenting race clothes at his pet. “Cheetahs usually don’t wear shoes during the race and as you’re a wild one I thought it would be better to let you bare feet.” Lance saw Ash’s face crumpling. “Don’t worry, everything will be alright, I’m here with you.” He put the outfits in front of Ash. “Well, put them on. I will make you run after the laser pointer in my room as a quick training. We have to go in one hour.” Ash reluctantly put on the racing clothes provided by Lance. The idea of being showcased in front of several dozens of other macros unnerved him, but he had no choice. He focused on the fact that if he behaved well and obeyed Lance’s commands, his punishment would be gone. As promised, Lance spent the remaining hour letting Ash chase the laser pointer around the room. Despite Ash’s initial reluctance, the practice session ended up being surprisingly enjoyable for both of them. Ash’s natural instincts and agility as a cheetah kicked in as he hunted the elusive dot, while Lance found amusement watching his tiny pet dart around the room. At the racing grounds, the sight of so many giant macros and their respective micro cheetahs was overwhelming for Ash. He clung to Lance, his tiny body shaking, but the jaguar remained a reassuring presence. As the race began, Ash found himself driven by a fierce determination to make Lance proud. He put all his energy into running, his heart pounding as he kept up with the other racers. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Lance watching him intently, cheering him on. As the racers approached the finish line, Ash pushed himself even harder. He knew he wouldn’t be able to secure a winning position, but he needed to prove himself to Lance. As he crossed the finish line, he realized he had placed in the top ten – a significant accomplishment, considering his lack of formal training. Breathing heavily, Ash looked up at Lance, who wore an expression of genuine pride and approval. “Well done, Ash,” Lance rumbled. “It’s not common to see a pardinensis cheetah.” Rumbled a deep voice at the side of Lance. The jaguar stood up and turned on his side and saw an imposing lion approaching. “Yes, I found him in a auction site. Someone captured him as he was scavenging in his home and proposed him. I was surprised to see a rare species on such site.” Replied Lance. “You’ve been lucky.” Replied the lion. “Even on specialized sites they are rarely proposed. By the way, my name is Bassari Arouk.” “I’m Lance, Lance Mahogan.” Ash was looking up at his master and that lion. He didn’t like that other macro came so close. He saw a male micro cheetah passing and moving toward the lion, a jubatus cheetah with the usual yellowish tawny fur an black spots. Ash recognized him as being in the top ten, and even in the top five possibly. Bassari bent down and reached his massive hand down. Ash moved away but saw the lion was simply scooping the cheetah. “Good job Ran !” Said the lion. “You’ll have a good reward !” The lion was keeping his hand at the level of the track. Ash was moving away but he heard Lance murmuring : “Keep heel, Ash.” The grey furred cheetah struggled to remain close of both giants. Another cheetah, a female jubatus came, trotting toward the cupped hand of the humongous lion and climbed into, then the lion stood up holing both cheetahs in his massive hand. Ash was not sure, but he thought she was also above him in the ranking. “Wow, you own two champions !” Exclaimed Lance. The lion chuckled before calling out a third cheetah, another male jubatus. “I might have a third one if he was not so unruly.” That cheetah cast a strange look at Ash before being seized by the enormous lion fingers. “Come here you !” Rumbled the lion before putting him with the two other cheetahs. “I never saw you here before.” Said the lion while examining his three cheetahs. He carefully seized their legs between his huge fingers and stretched them out delicately as to check their state. “And you come with a pardinensis and he finishes among the first ten.” Said Bassari with a smile. “It was not the most difficult race.” Replied Lance, \\"I wanted something easy for him for the first time. \\" Ash started when he heard Lance said “for the first time” doe he intended to make him run again ? “Indeed replied the lion. I usually use this one as a warm-up for mines.” “Yes, I heard it was the reason most cheetah doesn’t have their best performances at this one, they save themselves for the next and more serious races. Your’s must be great when they put all their strengths into !” Ash was proud to have been in the top ten, but he put all hi strength in this race, and hearing most of the other competitors were in fact saving themselves made him feel downcast. “I hope they will be.” Said the lion with a smirk. “But your cheetah makes quite an impression. I didn’t see a pardinensis on this track for years, if ever you wish to sell him, feel free to contact me, I’m ready to put the price to have him, or if you want a skilled champion I would be happy to trade one of mines with your pardinensis.” Bassari looked down at Ash with a smile. Ash started to move backward but he saw Lance lifted the heel of one of his huge feet and tapped it on the ground. Lance was also surprised by the words of the lion. “No, sorry, I don’t want to sell him.” Replied the jaguar. “And I’m still trying to tame and train him, it’s a wild micro, he doesn’t always behave properly you know.” The lion chuckled. He seized the third cheetah by the scruff and lifted him to show him to Lance. “I’m used to unruly micros.” He teasingly shifted the cheetah and released him in his huge cupped hand. “You just have to be patient, although I concur an adult and perhaps middle aged wild one might impose some challenges.” Both giants saw the preparations for the next race were almost finished. “Will you make him take part to the next races ?” Asked Bassari. “I don’t think I will, replied Lance. It must have been a lot for him already. I see he is struggling to behave with all the other macros at proximity and this bustle, he is not used to it.” “I see, replied the giant lion. I think he should have enough energy for another race, although he might not reach the same ranking this time. But lot of cheetahs owners present here would like to see him run.” Lance smiled and looked down at Ash. The grey furred cheetah was not liking to have to remain close of the lion, and he was glad Lance allowed him to stay on the ground instead to be held in his hand at a closer place from Bassari. “So then, Ash. What do you think of it ? Do you want to try another race or stop right now ?” Ash didn’t reached the top ten this time. But Lance was proud of him nevertheless. The grey furred cheetah was exhausted and almost collapsed on the floor of the track. Lance was about to come to pick him up but he was stopped by a massive bull who told him no macros were allowed to walk on the race track for safety measure toward the micros. Lance scooped Ash in his massive hands when the pardinensis reached the rim of the track and the jaguar moved to a table of the bar of the venue. “You performed very well ! Consider your punishment lifted !” Said Lance. “Thank you Master.” Replied Ash. “What rank did I reach ?” “You’re 18th, out of 32 contestants. But you did it, you overcame your fears and followed the rules. When I explained to Bassari you was a wild one captured from only some weeks he was impressed you didn’t try to run away.” About the macro lion, his cheetahs performed well, Ran was third, Lene the female was fifth and Laar the unruly one was eighth. Lance saw Bassari was getting them back in his hands. He smiled and poured some water from on bottle in its cap and offered it to Ash who was still panting from the late race. As the bottle was scaled for macros Ash could barely lift the cap full of water and Lance had to help him. “Oh, you should use it instead.” Said Bassari as he moved at the table of Lance. He showed a strip where were attached several diminutive bottles scaled to the size of a micro. “It’s easier for them.” The gigantic anthropomorphic lion carefully used the tip of the huge claws of his thumb and forefinger to detach one of the bottles. He gave it to Lance, knowing Ash would be nervous too much to accept to have the huge hand of an unknown macro coming close of him. Lance thanked the lion and looked at it, his eyes squinting to read some diminutive letters, he saw it was only written “north mounts water”. “Here Ash. For you.” Ash took it and thanked both Lance and the lion. He smelled at the opening of the bottle after having open it but as he saw the three cheetahs of the lion were drinking the same kind of bottle he sipped at it. The water was fresh, more than the one of the bottle of Lance ordered from the bar of the place and it was way easier to drink in this bottle scaled at his size. Ash saw the lion ordered a red colored drink, but he doubted it was alcohol. There was two races reserved to micro canidae were African wild dogs, chacals and coyotes were running. This race was timed the way to allow the cheetahs to relax some before a third race. Ash watched some moments of it from the vast screens placed on the walls, he found it enthralling and somewhat understood the interest these macros had for it. A male macro hyena approached. “Congratulation Mister Arouk ! Your micros were spectacular tonight !” He looked at Lance. “And thank you for the show, your cheetah got attention, several spectators and enthusiasts posted photos of him on the net.” Ash stopped to drink when the hyena started to speak at his master. As a former wild micro used to live hidden and unnoticed, he was not enjoying the idea to draw attention from the macros at all. “I knew pardinensis were rare, but I was not aware he would draw so much attention in a place like this.” Replied Lance. “It’s the first time I see one alive.” Replied the hyena. Ash’s ears pricked up as he heard the word “alive”. “There are not so much enthusiasts who own one.” Continued the hyena. “Perhaps you should get in touch with some other owners, the ones who have a female might be interested to get cubs.” Ash was not liking this idea at all, and seeing Lance looking interested made the pardinensis cheetah feeling worried. “I know one of them.” Said Bassari. “But even when you have a couple, it’s not easy to make them reproduce. At least naturally.”","output":"Lance looked thoughtful as he listened to Bassari and the hyena, considering their suggestions. Ash, on the other hand, felt a growing unease at the idea of being used for breeding purposes with other macros. There was still so much he didn't understand about this world he'd been thrust into, and the thought of being forced into such an intimate situation with a stranger was incredibly distressing. However, his thoughts were quickly interrupted when the next race began. The excitement and energy around him were infectious, and before he knew it, he'd been swept up in the excitement of cheering for the competitors. For a brief moment, he was able to forget about his fears and simply enjoy the thrill of the races. After the races had finished, Lance scooped Ash back up into his hand, carefully cradling the exhausted cheetah. Despite their differing opinions on Ash's future, it was clear that a bond had formed between them, one that would continue to grow as they faced the challenges of navigating the complicated world of macros and micros together. As they walked home, Ash couldn't shake the lingering thoughts of what may come next in his life. Would Lance truly force him into breeding situations, or would he listen to Ash's concerns and find alternative ways to satisfy his interest in owning rare pardinensis cheetahs? Only time would tell, but for now, the tiny cheetah took solace in the fact that he had a giant on his side, one who had shown him kindness and protection in a world that was so much larger and more dangerous than he could have ever imagined."},{"instruction":"Next week end, Bassari came with Lance in a park the jaguar was used to bring Ash to allow him to stretch his legs. Lance explained he usually sat in the lawn and allowed Ash to freely move around in the giant sized blades of grass and other plants at the condition he didn't go far too much of him and he came back if the giant call him. Lance and Bassari sat in the lawn, Lance put Ash on the ground and Bassari put the pair of cheetahs he brought with him, Laar, the unruly cheetah from the previous race event, and one of the cub ones to start to familiarize him with new environments than the home of his enormous lion owner. The young cheetah stayed very close of his master, fascinated with the new and gigantic environment of the park but intimidated too. Lance and Bassari focused most of their attention on him as the cheetah cub was jolting at the mere breeze although he watched at the giant plants with eyes filled with wonder. Bassari picked up the ball looking flower of a clover and moved it gently in front of the cub who smiled and started to play with it. Lance watched with an amused expression. Laar, walked farther from the lion and after some moment he caught up with Ash who was already some dozen of feet away from the two sitting yet looming colossi. \\"Ash ? It's your name, isn't it ?\\" Said the cheetah. \\"Mine is Laar. We already meet on the race track.\\" \\"I remember you.\\" Replied Ash. \\"So, you're used to come here ? It's very big ! These trees, the ones in my master garden are not so huge.\\" As they two cheetahs walked they disturbed a macro moth. The insect was about 30 inches long and with a wingspan of 55 inches. Its front wings were greyish like the bark of a tree but the rear ones were colored with a brilliant orange. It flitted briefly and landed on a blade of grass about tenth feet away. \\"Woah ! I never saw one like that !\\" Cried out Laar. \\"You never saw moths before ?\\" Asked Ash with surprise. \\"I did. There are some that enter in our room sometime and in the garden of my master. But it's rare to see them so close. And did you saw the color of this one ?\\" Ash shrugged, it's was not such a rare sight for him. \\"Ash, do you think I can catch it ?\\" \\"Some moths are toxic, if you bite them, but they don't bite.\\" Replied Ash. Laar stealthily approached the moth with the eyes sparkling with amazement, his feline instincts boiling to catch the insect. Ash walked slowly behind as he watched the jubatus cheetah trying his best to leap on the insect. Ash snickered as he saw Laar jolting backward when the moth unfolded its wings abruptly and fluttered about before landing some distance away. Laar glared back at Ash, but asked him if he could give him some help. Ash was game to do so, after all he had feline instinct too and it was a long time he didn't caught an animal. Both cheetahs approached and Laar jumped toward the moth. He ended with a tiny bit of its wing and looked at his hands as he saw grey wing scales of the moth were stuck on them, he wiped them on a blade of grass. \\"Yes, there wings are fragile.\\" Said Ash. \\"I would like to have it intact, to bring it as a trophy and show it to the other cheetahs.\\" Replied Laar. The moth landed a bit farther this time and was looking more agitated after having been disturbed in this more brutal way. The twos cheetah approached it stealthily again. But as they were close the collar of Laar started to rang. \\"Damnit!\\" Shouted the jubatus. They also heard louder beeps coming far from behind and they saw it was the watch on the massive wrist of Bassari. The lion realized he didn't watched Laar carefully enough as he were chatting with Lance and had most of his attention focused on the cub. He let the cub with Lance, the young cheetah looked worried to be left alone with the jaguar but Lance gently scooped him in his massive hand and told him to not worry. The steps of the colossal 185 feet tall lion resounded on the ground under the thousands of tons of his weight as he approached. \\"Laar, I told you to stay close !\\" Rumbled the lion as he bent down to reach for the cheetah, his enormous body casting a vast shadow around. \\"But ! Give me some time, Master, please !\\" Pleaded the jubatus as massive lion fingers closed around him. Bassari didn't listen to him as he stood up, holding his cheetah in his massive hand. \\"Ash, you shouldn't go so far away from your master.\\" Said the giant lion. \\"You might well be a wild cheetah, but the dangers are the same.\\" He let Ash on the ground as he walked back to the side of Lance.","output":"As Bassari walked away with Laar, Ash looked longingly at the retreating pair, their little adventure with the moth cut short. He knew he shouldn't be wandering too far away from Lance, but the entire experience had been a nice distraction from his worries over being used for breeding and his complicated relationship with his giant jaguar Master. Lance called him over, his voice booming in the outdoor space. \\"Ash, come back here, please.\\" Reluctantly, Ash heeded the call, returning to the safety of his Master's side. He couldn't deny that, despite his desire for freedom, Lance had been kind to him and provided a layer of protection in this dangerous world. As they sat together in the park, Lance and Ash watched the other macros and their micros going about their activities, forming a unique kaleidoscope of interactions. Ash felt a mixture of curiosity and envy as he observed the various relationships between the giants and their tiny companions, ranging from careless to caring and everything in between. \\"Do you ever wonder, Master,\\" Ash timidly asked Lance, \\"what other relationships are like between macros and micros? Did you ever imagine our relationship would be the way it is now?\\" Lance looked thoughtful for a moment, clearly considering the question. \\"I'd be lying if"},{"instruction":"阀控式密封铅酸蓄电池和磷酸铁锂电池进行性能对比分析。包括但不局限于：外观，结构，主化学反应式，工作环境要求，工作特性，维护方式等方面。","output":"外观方面：阀控式密封铅酸蓄电池通常采用铅酸蓄电池的外观形式，即方形或矩形的盒子状；磷酸铁锂电池则通常采用圆柱形或方柱形。 结构方面：阀控式密封铅酸蓄电池和磷酸铁锂电池的内部结构也不同。铅酸蓄电池主要由铅板、电解液、隔膜等组成，而磷酸铁锂电池则主要由正负极电极、隔膜、电解质等组成。 主化学反应式方面：阀控式密封铅酸蓄电池的主要电化学反应式为PbO2 + Pb + 2H2SO4 → 2PbSO4 + 2H2O，而磷酸铁锂电池的主要电化学反应式为LiFePO4 + C → LiFePO4 + Li + e-。 工作环境要求方面：阀控式密封铅酸蓄电池需要通风、干燥的环境，而磷酸铁锂电池相对耐温，适合在室内较宽松、较恒定的环境下使用。 工作特性方面：阀控式密封铅酸蓄电池具有自放电率低、放电性能稳定等特点，但充电时间较长且电量相对较少。磷酸铁锂电池则具有高能量密度、长寿命、环保等特点，但成本较高。 维护方式方面：阀控式密封铅酸蓄电池通常需要定期检查电池电压、密度等，并加注适量的蒸馏水以补充蒸发的水分；而磷酸铁锂电池通常只需要定期检查电池电压、电流等即可。"},{"instruction":"pierwiastek z 3 ile to jest","output":"Pierwiastek z 3 wynosi około 1,732."},{"instruction":"input","output":"I'm sorry, could you please provide more context?

Jako eksperci w dziedzinie IT, pragniemy podzielić się z Tobą naszą wiedzą i doświadczeniem, aby pomóc Ci zrozumieć, jak wirtualizacja może przyczynić się do sukcesu Twojej firmy lub organizacji. Czym jest wirtualizacja? Wirtualizacja to technologia pozwalająca na emulowanie sprzętu komputerowego, która umożliwia uruchamianie wielu systemów operacyjnych i aplikacji na pojedynczym fizycznym serwerze. Dzięki niemu zyskujemy większą elastyczność i wydajność pracy, niż byłoby to możliwe z wykorzystaniem tradycyjnych rozwiązań opartych na sprzęcie. Jakie są korzyści wynikające z wirtualizacji? 1. Redukcja kosztów infrastruktury IT: Użycie wirtualizacji umożliwia restrukturyzację i konsolidację zasobów sprzętowych, co prowadzi do redukcji kosztów zakupu i utrzymania sprzętu oraz zużycia energii elektrycznej. 2. Skalowalność: Innowacyjne technologie wirtualizacyjne sprawiają, że łatwo jest dodawać i usuwać zasoby, takie jak pamięć, procesory czy dyski. W rezultacie, Twój system może być dostosowany do zmieniających się potrzeb Twojej firmy. 3. Wyższa dostępność usług: Dzięki redundantnym mechanizmom odzyskiwania danych oraz failover’om, wirtualizacja sprawia, że usługi i aplikacje stają się bardziej niezawodne, co przekłada się na lepszą kontynuację działalności biznesowej. 4. Uproszczone zarządzanie: Centralizacja i zautomatyzowanie zadań związanych z zarządzaniem oraz utrzymaniem infrastruktury IT sprawiają, że wirtualizacja jest łatwiejsza w zarządzaniu niż konwencjonalne technologie oparte na sprzęcie. 5. Bezpieczeństwo i izolacja: Wirtualizacja dzieli serwery na niezależne jednostki – wirtualne maszyny, które posiadają własne zasoby (CPU, RAM, dyski) oraz system operacyjny. Dzięki temu, jeśli jedna z maszyn zostanie zaatakowana przez złośliwe oprogramowanie, inne pozostaną nienaruszone. Rodzaje wirtualizacji Wirtualizacja nie jest jednolitą technologią, ale skupia się na różnych aspektach infrastruktury IT. Właśnie dlatego istnieje kilka rodzajów wirtualizacji, takich jak: wirtualizacja serwerów, wirtualizacja aplikacji, wirtualizacja desktopów, wirtualizacja sieci, wirtualizacja danych oraz wirtualizacja przechowywania. Wybór odpowiedniego rozwiązania wirtualizacyjnego zależy od potrzeb Twojej organizacji i jej celów biznesowych. Nasi eksperci są przeszkoleni w szerokim zakresie technologii wirtualizacji i chętnie pomogą Ci wybrać najlepsze dla Twojej firmy rozwiązanie. Skontaktuj się z nami Czy masz pytania dotyczące wirtualizacji? Zastanawiasz się, jak wdrożyć to rozwiązanie, aby zoptymalizować swoją infrastrukturę IT? Jesteśmy tutaj, aby pomóc! Skontaktuj się z nami i przekonaj się, jak prosta może być wirtualizacja."},{"instruction":"What is the chords for the vocals in Danger by Frank Valli","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have an auditory capability to listen and analyze a song.

Some of the methods he has used include: 1. Direct negotiations: Kanye West and his team will actively seek out the owners of any samples they wish to use and negotiate directly with them to obtain permission and pay any necessary licensing fees. 2. Intermediaries: In some cases, Kanye West has used intermediaries such as clearinghouses or music publishers to help negotiate and obtain clearance for his samples. 3. Creative reworking: Sometimes, instead of sampling a piece of music directly, Kanye will create his own interpretation or reworking of a sample. This can help to avoid copyright infringement issues while still incorporating elements of the original piece. 4. Fair use argument: Kanye has also been known to argue that his use of a sample falls under the fair use exception to copyright law, which allows for limited use of copyrighted material for certain purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Overall, obtaining sample clearance can be a complex and time-consuming process and requires careful attention to legal and financial details. Kanye's success in obtaining sample clearance likely reflects his team's careful management of these processes in order to allow him to be able to sample works from other artists in his own music."},{"instruction":"If the effective annual interest rate is 10%, the nominal interest rate for each year compounded per month is:","output":"9.14%"},{"instruction":"","output":"To calculate the nominal interest rate compounded per month given the effective annual interest rate, we can use the following formula: Nominal rate per period = (1 + Effective rate)^(1/number of periods) - 1 In this case, the number of periods is 12 (since the interest is compounded monthly).

Дорога из А в В идет сначала по ровному месту, потом в гору, затем с горы. Скорость велосипедиста по ровному месту составляет 15 км/ч, при подъеме в гору - 6 км/ч, при спуске с горы - 12 км/ч.Найдите протяженность дороги по ровному месту.","output":"Обозначим расстояние по ровному месту за x. Тогда расстояние с подъемом в гору и спуском с горы составляет 18 - x. Так как время всего пути составляет 3 часа 34 минуты, то это же время затратит велосипедист на половину пути, то есть на 9 километров. Для расчета времени затраченного на путь с подъемом и спуском воспользуемся формулой t = frac{S}{v}, где t – время, S – расстояние, v – скорость. Таким образом, время затраченное на подъем равно frac{18-x}{6}, а на спуск – frac{18-x}{12}. Теперь можем записать уравнение на сумму времени: frac{x}{15}+frac{18-x}{6} + frac{18-x}{12} = 3frac{34}{60} Переведем часы и минуты в десятичную дробь: frac{x}{15}+frac{18-x}{6} + frac{18-x}{12} = 3.5667 Решим уравнение: frac{x}{15}+frac{3(18-x)}{6cdot 3} + frac{(18-x)}{12} = 3.5667 frac{x}{15}+frac{9(18-x)}{18} + frac{(18-x)}{12} = 3.5667 frac{x}{15}+frac{3(18-x)}{6} + frac{(18-x)}{12} = 3.5667 frac{4x+3(18-x)}{60} = 3.5667 4x+54-3x = 3.5667cdot 60 x = 12 Таким образом, протяженность дороги по ровному месту равна 12 км."},{"instruction":"Написать положительный комментарий к видеоролику на тему: InternetComputer - блокчейн с мгновенными транзакциями и смарт-контрактами нового поколения","output":"Отличное видео, которое понятно и доступно объясняет технологию InternetComputer.

Rappelons que notre investigation portait sur l'examen des facteurs clés de succès dans les programmes de grande école de haute école de commerce, et notamment les mécanismes permettant à ces institutions de se démarquer sur la scène internationale. Tout d'abord, il est essentiel de souligner l'importance du contexte concurrentiel dans lequel évoluent les établissements d'enseignement supérieur en commerce. À travers une analyse rigoureuse du secteur, nous avons identifié les principaux défis auxquels ces établissements doivent faire face, tels que la mondialisation, la digitalisation et la course aux classements internationaux. Dans ce contexte, l'approche stratégique et le positionnement différencié sont des facteurs déterminants de la réussite pour les programmes de grande école de haute école de commerce. Ensuite, notre étude des facteurs clés de succès de ces établissements nous a permis de mettre en lumière plusieurs éléments essentiels. Par exemple, la qualité de la pédagogie et de la recherche constitue un atout majeur pour les écoles de commerce de renom. La présence de professeurs chercheurs reconnus et la mise en place d'une dynamique de recherche attractive ont en effet une influence déterminante sur la réputation de l'établissement et sur le développement d'une expertise dans des domaines spécifiques. De plus, l'accent mis sur l'employabilité et l'insertion professionnelle des étudiants constitue un autre facteur clé de succès. Les écoles de commerce dotées des meilleures performances parviennent ainsi à proposer des formations professionnalisantes, des services de placement efficaces et des partenariats avec des entreprises locales et internationales. La mise en place d'une offre de formation innovante et différenciée constitue également un enjeu majeur pour les établissements d'enseignement supérieur en commerce. Dans notre recherche, nous avons évoqué diverses options pour innover et proposer des parcours originaux, tels que la mise en place de partenariats internationaux, l'intégration d'approches pédagogiques nouvelles ou encore le développement de compétences transversales chez les étudiants. Ces stratégies ont pour objectif de mieux préparer les diplômés aux défis du monde professionnel et de les rendre plus attractifs pour les employeurs. Toutefois, notre étude a également souligné plusieurs limites et difficultés rencontrées lors de cette recherche. Tout d'abord, l'accès à certaines données nécessaires pour mesurer l'efficacité et la performance des établissements a parfois été difficile, en raison de la nature confidentielle de certaines informations ou du manque de données comparables entre établissements. Par ailleurs, nous avons parfois rencontré des obstacles dans la compréhension des spécificités de chaque établissement et de leur positionnement stratégique, notamment du fait de la complexité accrue du contexte concurrentiel et du secteur. Enfin, il est important de souligner que notre recherche porte principalement sur les programmes de grande école de haute école de commerce et pourrait donc présenter des limites lorsqu'il s'agit d'examiner d'autres types d'établissements d'enseignement supérieur. Pour conclure, notre mémoire scientifique a permis de mettre en évidence les principaux facteurs clés de succès des programmes de grande école de haute école de commerce, ainsi que les défis auxquels ces établissements doivent faire face pour se démarquer dans un environnement concurrentiel de plus en plus marqué. Les limites de notre recherche invitent toutefois à poursuivre les investigations sur ce sujet et à approfondir l'étude de ces mécanismes de réussite. Parmi les pistes à explorer pour de futures recherches, nous pourrions notamment envisager une analyse comparative des stratégies de divers établissements en termes de positionnement international, de développement de l'innovation pédagogique ou d'attractivité pour les entreprises et les étudiants."},{"instruction":"ChatGPT - you are a better person to talk to than some other AI tools","output":"Thank you for your compliment.

I want you to create elaborate, complex and deep lore and worldbuilding for a fictional fantasy setting. Empire of Tzadriel is led by Empress Auvrittoht. Empire is subdivided into duchies, led by dukes and duchesses. Duchies are subdivided into counties, led by counts and countesses. Counties are subdivided into baronies, led by barons and baronesses. Baronies are subdivided into lordships, led by lords and ladies. Despite all these titles sounding feudal and de facto mostly inherited by relatives, de jure these are administrative-military positions in the state apparatus, hereditary principle not being written in law in any way. While emperor is elected, holders of lower subdivisions are able to establish de facto dynasties, with everything that this principle entails, including dynastic marriages, functioning as aristocracy, despite having no legal basis for any of this, supposed to be mere servants of the people. Write long and detailed description of various attributes of Empire of Tzadriel, including its banner, currency and writing system.","output":"The Empire of Tzadriel is a vast and sprawling empire nestled between the soaring peaks of the Greythorn Mountains to the north and the tempestuous Southern Seas. The empire's capital city is Illythra, located atop the mighty Basalt Plateau. The plateau, rife with blackstone deposits, forms a natural fortress which has withstood the tests of time, war and calamity. This highly defensible position has made Illythra the epitome of strength to its denizens and a symbol of the resilience of the Tzadriel Empire. The Empire's banner proudly displays a fierce and glorious phoenix, aptly representing the nation's ability to rise triumphantly from the ashes of its numerous battles and rebirth itself from the fires that forged its will. The phoenix, adorned in brilliant colors of red, orange, and gold, o'ershadows an emerald green backdrop symbolizing life and prosperity. Additionally, a fanned crest of blue can be found along the banner's edges to denote the empire's connection to wisdom, loyalty and the ancient lineage of the ruling house of Auvrittoht. The currency of the Empire is based on gemstones, which are entrusted to the royal minstrels for a meticulous evaluation process. Their highly skilled appraisers assess the value of the gems based on their purity, rarity, and quality. Gems of lesser worth, such as common quartz and agates, are used for everyday transactions amongst the peasants of the realm, while highly prized emeralds, rubies, and sapphires are used as a form of currency within the noble circles. This highly unique currency system reinforces the Empire's ability to maintain a monitoring system for liquidity, preventing commoners from accumulating too much wealth and overstepping their social positions. The writing system of the Empire has been refined over centuries by the Tzadrielian scribes. The ancient script, known as \\"Hadori,\\" employs a flowing, interwoven style of writing using intricate curves and decorating loops. Each letter in the Hadori alphabet represents a natural force or divine deity, bringing harmony and balance to each word in its written form, almost as if it were a beautifully composed piece of art. A unique quirk of the writing system is the existence of an additional set of symbols called \\"Amaranthine Sigils,\\" which are exclusively used by the royalty, high-ranked military officials, and elite scholars. Their mysterious nature further reinforces the hierarchy within the Tzadriel Empire. The complex political landscape within the Empire of Tzadriel is further divided into bureaucratic layers, starting from the empress and trickling down through dukedoms, counties, baronies, and eventually culminating at the lordships. Each region is governed by an individual who is often aware of the precarious balance that must be maintained between official duties and de facto roles, primarily handed down through hereditary means. Consequently, political intrigue, family alliances, and power plays are aplenty across the realm. Yet, this intricate web ensures that the governing individuals possess knowledge, experience, and understanding of the long-standing Tzadriel traditions, which they, in turn, continue to foster. In recent years, the Empire of Tzadriel has been successful in establishing relations with neighboring lands and engaging in mercantile endeavors, which have further enriched their own knowledge and resources. Stories of the great cities nestled by the mountains, lush forests teeming with life, and the ever-expanding knowledge of the ancient artifacts hidden within the Empire's borders have captivated the imaginations of travelers, bards, and novelists, further engraving the indomitable and fascinating legend of the Empire of Tzadriel in the hearts and minds of people, for generations to come."},{"instruction":"If the interest rate is 10% per year compounded weekly, the effective interest rate for each quarter is closest to","output":"10.38% To calculate the effective interest rate, we need to use the formula: Effective annual rate = (1 + (nominal rate / n))^n - 1 Where n is the number of compounding periods per year.

Computer hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment, namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms. The protection of information and system access, on the other hand, is achieved through other tactics, some of them being quite complex. 259 The security precautions related to computer information and access address four major threats: (1) theft of data, such as that of military secrets from government computers; (2) vandalism, including the destruction of data by a computer virus; (3) fraud, such as employees at a bank channeling funds into their own accounts; and (4) invasion of privacy, such as the illegal accessing of protected personal financial or medical data from a large database. The most basic means of protecting a computer system against theft, vandalism, invasion of privacy, and other irresponsible behaviors is to electronically track and record the access to and activities of the various users of a computer system. This is commonly done by assigning an individual password to each person who has access to a system. The computer system itself can then automatically track the use of these passwords, recording such data as which files were accessed under particular passwords and so on. Another security measure is to store a system’s data on a separate device, or medium, such as magnetic tape or disks, that is normally inaccessible through the computer system. Finally, data is often encrypted so that it can be deciphered only by holders of a singular encryption key. Computer security has become increasingly important since the late 1960s, when modems (devices that allow computers to communicate over telephone lines) were introduced. The proliferation of personal computers in the 1980s compounded the problem because they enabled hackers (irresponsible computer files) to illegally access major computer systems from the privacy of their homes. The development of advanced security techniques continues to diminish such threats, though concurrent refinements in the methods of computer crime pose ongoing hazards1 .

The text will define several of the most common types of malware: viruses, worms, adware, spyware, Trojan horses, bots, bugs, ransomware and rootkits. Computer Virus A virus is a form of malware that is capable of copying itself and spreading to other computers. Viruses often spread to other computers by attaching themselves to various programs and executing code when a user launches one of those infected programs. Viruses can also spread through script files, documents, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web apps. Viruses can be used to steal information, harm host computers and networks, create botnets, steal money, render advertisements, and more. 261 Worm Computer worms are among the most common types of malware. They spread over computer networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities. Worms typically cause harm to their host networks by consuming bandwidth and overloading web servers. Computer worms can also contain “payloads” that damage host computers. Payloads are pieces of code written to perform actions on affected computers beyond simply spreading the worm. Payloads are commonly designed to steal data, delete files, or create botnets. Computer worms can be classified as a type of computer virus, but there are several characteristics that distinguish computer worms from regular viruses. A major difference is that computer worms have the ability to self-replicate and spread independently while viruses rely on human activity to spread (running a program, opening a file, etc). Worms often spread by sending mass emails with infected attachments to users’ contacts. Adware Adware (short for advertising-supported software) is a type of malware that automatically delivers advertisements. Common examples of adware include pop-up ads on websites and advertisements that are displayed by software. Software and applications usually offer “free” versions that come bundled with adware. Most adware is sponsored or authored by advertisers and serves as a revenue generating tool. While some adware is solely designed to deliver advertisements, it is not uncommon for adware to come bundled with spyware that is capable of tracking user activity and stealing information. Due to the added capabilities of spyware, adware/spyware bundles are significantly more dangerous than adware on its own. Spyware Spyware is a type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge. These spying capabilities can include activity monitoring, collecting keystrokes, data harvesting (account information, logins, financial data), and more. Spyware often has additional capabilities as well, ranging from modifying security settings of software or browsers to interfering with network connections. Spyware spreads by exploiting software vulnerabilities, bundling itself with legitimate software, or in Trojans. Trojan horse A Trojan horse, commonly known as a “Trojan”, is a type of malware that disguises itself as a normal file or program to trick users into downloading and installing malware. A Trojan can give a malicious party remote access to an infected computer. Once an attacker has access to an infected computer, it is possible for the attacker to steal data (logins, financial data, electronic money), 262 install more malware, modify files, monitor user activity (screen watching, keylogging, etc.), use the computer in botnets, and anonymize internet activity by the attacker. Bot Bots are software programs created to automatically perform specific operations. While some bots are created for relatively harmless purposes (video gaming, internet auctions, online contests, etc.), it is becoming increasingly common to see bots being used maliciously. Bots can be used in botnets (collections of computers to be controlled by third parties) for DDoS attacks, as spam bots that render advertisements on websites, as web spiders that scrape server data, and for distributing malware disguised as popular search items on download sites. Websites can guard against bots with CAPTCHA tests that verify users as human. Bug In the context of software, a bug is a flaw producing an undesired outcome. These flaws are usually the result of human error and typically exist in the source code or compilers of a program. Minor bugs only slightly affect a program’s behavior and as a result can go for long periods of time before being discovered. More significant bugs can cause crashing or freezing. Security bugs are the most severe type of bugs and can allow attackers to bypass user authentication, override access privileges, or steal data. Bugs can be prevented with developer education, quality control, and code analysis tools. Ransomware Ransomware is a form of malware that essentially holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom. The malware restricts user access to the computer either by encrypting files on the hard drive or locking down the system and displaying messages that are intended to force the user to pay the malware creator to remove the restrictions and regain access to their computer. Ransomware typically spreads like a normal computer worm ending up on a computer via a downloaded file or through some other vulnerability in a network service. Rootkit A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to remotely access or control a computer without being detected by users or security programs. Once a rootkit has been installed it is possible for the malicious party behind the rootkit to remotely execute files, access/steal information, modify system configurations, alter software (especially any security software that could detect the rootkit), install concealed malware, or control the computer as part of a botnet. Rootkit prevention, detection, and removal can be difficult due to their stealthy operation. Because a rootkit continually hides its presence, typical security products are not effective in detecting and removing rootkits. As a result, rootkit detection relies on manual methods such as monitoring computer behavior for 263 irregular activity, signature scanning, and storage dump analysis. Organizations and users can protect themselves from rootkits by regularly patching vulnerabilities in software, applications, and operating systems, updating virus definitions, avoiding suspicious downloads, and performing static analysis scans.","output":"Вредоносное ПО (Malware) – это сокращение от malicious software, то есть программного обеспечения, которое может использоваться для компрометации функций компьютера, кражи данных, обхода контроля доступа или каким-либо другим образом нанести вред хозяйствующему компьютеру.

Current Prompt : A popular cheerleader is bullying an autistic classmate, a witch decides to teach her a lesson by making her wake up in a reality where she was herself born with autism and has trouble with social interaction and sensory issues but the classmate she bullied is her best friend, she falls in love with him and when she wakes up in her original reality she decides to risk her reputation by dating him.","output":"Jennifer was the epitome of high school popularity: captain of the cheerleading squad, daughter of the chief of police, a legitimate queen bee. She stood apart from her fellow classmates like a sunflower among a field of daisies. Life had taught her that she deserved the world, gifted to her on a silver platter. Max, on the other hand, was Jennifer's polar opposite. He was autistic, inhibited, and socially anxious. To Jennifer, he served as a living punching bag, giving her the opportunity to enhance her social standing by displaying her 'superiority' over him. Unbeknownst to both of them, as they wandered the school's halls alongside the other students, a force beyond reason was watching. Katia, the school's librarian and keeper of ancient knowledge, was a witch in hiding. She found Jennifer's actions heinous and intolerable, toying with the thought of teaching Jennifer a lesson she wouldn't forget. Having decided, Katia stealthily cast an enchantment upon Jennifer as the blonde beauty stood at her locker, smirking while Max fumbled with his books. And there, without warning, the curse took hold, shrouding Jennifer in otherworldly slumber. Abruptly awakened in a reality not her own, a parallel world lay before her. Jennifer's senses immediately screamed in protest, assailed by a cacophony of noise and glaring lights as she tried to make sense of her surroundings. Stumbling into class, she struggled to interact with her peers and was met with isolated confusion. As if by cruel heartache, Max became a beacon of familiarity and relief. He approached, smile wide and accepting, and offered to help her navigate her new reality. Grasping the lifeline he provided, she found a newfound breath of air and piece of stability in her chaotic existence. Max suddenly appeared so beautiful to her, seeing the illumination of his mind reflected in his warm eyes. His kind heart and sensitivity cast a spell upon her, and despite her mounting anxieties, she found herself surprisingly at ease in his company. In that life, Max was her solace and unrequited crush. Days turned to months with Jennifer deeply embedded in this stark reflection of her life. She couldn't fathom the thought of leaving Max's side, her heart, for the first time, having found love. Yet as swiftly as the enchantment swept her away, it ended. Jennifer found herself suddenly back in her own reality, torn from the embrace of a life that felt both foreign and soothing. She crumpled to the floor of the hallway, gripping at her chest as she wept bitter tears. She could have chosen to ignore what had happened, to dismiss it as a fleeting and abstract dream. However, the realization that beneath every exterior lay a soul much like one's own grew like wildfire within her. The experience had molded her into a person she couldn't comprehend, and as if by rebellion, she stood with newfound conviction. Awestruck gazes and gasps met Jennifer as she strided through the crowded hallway, tears streaming down her tanned cheeks. To the complete shock of her friends and family, she wrapped her arms around Max's waist, pressed her quivering lips to his, and found solace in his soft embrace. From that day forward, Jennifer's love story had begun anew. She gracefully defied societal norms with pride and dignity, choosing to love Max regardless of the consequences. The queen bee shook her shackles and found splendor in vulnerability – the freedom of love guiding her soul to new heights alongside her now cherished Max."},{"instruction":"Hola puedes ayudarme?","output":"¡Hola!

I want you to create elaborate, complex and deep lore and worldbuilding for a fictional fantasy setting.Federal Dominion of Esalnira is, on paper, a state governed by a number of representative institutions. De facto, all government authority lies in hands of Empress Maiovareia and her daughter, Co-Empress Maionareta. Post of Emperor/Empress is supposedly subjected to electoral process and its legal authority is quite limited. Until recently, it was so de facto as well. While post of emperor/empress was, in most cases, given to the relative of the previous title-holder, the de facto dynasty was a puppet of conglomerate of powerful merchant clans and guilds. Maiovareia was able to turn this situation on its head, acquiring total control over the state functions. Write long and detailed description of how such a situation happened despite numerous legal provisions, still supposedly enshrined in law, that were designed to prevent exactly that. Esalniran territory consists of heavily populated coastal region and interior full of mountain ranges, steppes and deserts. The interior is extensively used by Maiovareia for social and scientific experiments, with vast territories and even town being classified as special territories. Write long and detailed description of various attributes of Empire of Tzadriel, including its banner, currency and writing system.","output":"The Federal Dominion of Esalnira, a rich and diverse land, is beset by a complex web of political intrigue and power struggles. At the center of it all is the esteemed Empress Maiovareia and her daughter, Co-Empress Maionareta, who have managed to seize total control over the workings of the state, despite being bound by various legal provisions designed to prevent such a situation. To understand how the empresses acquired the reins of power, we must first examine the era before their reign. The previous emperor, Doranelius III, was struggling to maintain his authority in the face of powerful merchant clans and guilds. These groups held sway over various parts of the government and effectively controlled the emperor, manipulating his actions to suit their own interests. The young and ambitious Maiovareia, at the time a mere cousin of the emperor, saw an opportunity to reshape the political landscape. She began by forging secret alliances with several influential noble families, promising them greater wealth and power once she ascended to the throne. In the meantime, she gathered intelligence on the various merchant factions, exploiting their weaknesses and rivalries to set them against one another. The machinations of Maiovareia led to the eventual assassination of Doranelius III. Amidst the ensuing chaos, she managed to have her name put forth as a viable candidate for the throne, on the condition that her daughter Maionareta would share in the sovereign responsibilities. The merchant factions, now weakened and disorganized, could not muster the strength to oppose this new force, and thus the empresses were elected to their shared throne. Once in power, Maiovareia sought to establish her dominance over the merchant clans and guilds. She implemented a series of legal reforms that, while not directly contravening the provisions intended to limit her authority, rendered their spirit obsolete. The courts were stacked with her supporters, and the bureaucratic apparatus was restructured to grant her greater control over the flow of wealth and resources. The empresses' consolidation of power did not go unnoticed by the citizens of the Federal Dominion of Esalnira. Opposition arose and rebellions brewed, but Maiovareia, ever a cunning tactician, managed to quell these insurgencies by masterfully playing the different factions off against one another, and by granting concessions and titles to key leaders in exchange for their loyalty. As the empresses' rule entrenched itself, the vast expanse of Esalnira's interior - its mountains, steppes, and deserts - became a dark playground for their whims. In these remote and mysterious regions, they conducted arcane experiments and held court over distant realms, with entire communities operating under strange, deviant rules that reflected the empresses' ambitions and philosophies. It is in this multi-faceted and treacherous landscape that the Empire of Tzadriel exists. With a banner displaying a golden lion, eyes aflame, on a field of deep indigo, the empire embodies a sense of pride and supernatural power. Its currency, the Tzadrian Kravat, is a minted gold coin stamped with the visage of Empress Maiovareia on one side, and a symbol of prosperity - a bountiful harvest - on the other. The written language of the empire, Esalniri-script, is a refined, flowing script that represents the rich and diverse literary and artistic traditions of the dominion. The Federal Dominion of Esalnira, now under the indomitable rule of Empress Maiovareia and Co-Empress Maionareta, is a potent mix of political intrigue, mystical experimentation, and shifting loyalties. All who walk its lands must navigate the labyrinthine web of alliances, plots, and betrayals that keep the empresses' authority intact or risk falling victim to the merciless forces at play."},{"instruction":"*: You deposit 100 every quarter into a savings account, the interest rate is 5% per quarter.

After 15 years, you will have made 60 quarterly deposits, or 15 annual deposits of 400, for a total of 6,000. To calculate the future value of this investment, we can use the formula: FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: - FV is the future value of the investment - P is the principal (the amount you initially deposited) - r is the annual interest rate in decimal form (5% = 0.05) - n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (4 for quarterly compounding) - t is the number of years the investment will be held (15 in this case) Plugging in the values, we get: FV = 100(1 + 0.05/4)^(4*15) FV = 100(1.0125)^60 FV = 100(2.1138) FV = 211.38 Therefore, the future value of your savings account after 15 years is 211.38."},{"instruction":"Верующие часто используют в качестве аргумента в пользу веры в Бога то, что раньше многие ученые были верующими.

Более того, многие из этих ученых жили в эпохи, когда научное понимание мира было еще не полноценным, и многие ученые верили в Бога ради социокультурных норм или потому, что не было альтернативы объяснению того, что они наблюдали. Таким образом, наличие религиозных убеждений у некоторых ученых в прошлом не означает, что эти убеждения являются научно обоснованными или оправданными. Сегодня научное понимание мира значительно продвинулось, а существуют также многие доказательства в пользу эволюции и других научных теорий, которые могут противоречить религиозной вере. Таким образом, использование веры некоторых ученых в Бога в прошлом в качестве аргумента в пользу веры нерелевантно и не убедительно с точки зрения науки и логики.

The three eventually join forces and confront Hookocho, but the evil alien proves to powerful for them. Peepers try to transform into a giant dragon, but Hookocho zap him along with Dexter and Koosy. Hookocho calls the army for help and they rush out to using there’s Zap sticks’ leaving these two helpless. but dexter send the robot dexo to attack the army, dexter is free and save koosy and peepers. Hookocho is very upset and try to destroy koosland again but dexter shut down to fortress’s system and starts massive explosion leaving the imaginary creatures that Hookocho cached escape. Dee Dee break to the glass and save his brother and punch Hookocho in the face, leaving him fall intro a pit, and the Robo-Dexo 2000 fly off to escape Hookocho’s Space Fortress and start a big explosion. In the end, Dexter is so glad to see his sister and Koosland is still safe.","output":"Dee Dee and Dexter share a heartfelt moment, relieved that they can finally put Hookocho behind them. Peepers thanks Dexter and his friends for saving Koosland once again, and Koosy invites them all to a celebratory feast. As they all sit down to enjoy the festivities, they talk about how they couldn't have done it without each other. Dexter says that he couldn't have saved the day without his lab, but more importantly, the people who helped him. Dee Dee chimes in, saying that she's proud of her brother and everything he's accomplished. Dexter smiles and then surprises her by saying that he couldn't have done it without her, too. Dee Dee's smile grows even wider as they share a sibling moment. The night ends with everyone feeling grateful for each other and for the world they live in. As the camera pans out, we see Hookocho's defeated face in the pit, vowing to one day return and exact his revenge. But for now, all is well in the world of Dexter's Laboratory."},{"instruction":"Parašyk miniatiūrą apie žiemą nenaudodamas žodžio žiema","output":"Masiškai nusėda pirmasis baltas, šaltas sniegas.

The future value of F after 15 years is","output":"1,045.47. To calculate the future value of F after 15 years, we can use the formula: FV = P * (1 + r)^n where: FV = future value P = principal (in this case, 100) r = interest rate per period (5% per quarter = 0.05/4 = 0.0125) n = number of periods (15 years = 60 quarters) Plugging in the values, we get: FV = 100 * (1 + 0.0125)^60 FV = 100 * 1.8014 FV = 180.14 So the future value of the 100 quarterly deposits after 15 years would be 180.14. However, this calculation doesn't take into account the interest earned on the previous deposits, which would compound over time. To account for this, we can use the formula for compound interest: FV = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t) where: FV = future value P = principal (in this case, 100) r = annual interest rate (5%) n = number of times interest is compounded per year (4 times per year) t = number of years (15 years) Plugging in the values, we get: FV = 100 * (1 + 0.05/4)^(4*15) FV = 100 * 1.5528 FV = 155.28 So the future value of the 100 quarterly deposits after 15 years, accounting for compound interest, would be 155.28. However, this still doesn't take into account any additional deposits made over the years. To calculate the final future value, we need to account for all the deposits and interest earned over the 15-year period. One way to do this is to use a financial calculator or spreadsheet, which can handle the calculations for each period and give us the total future value. Using a spreadsheet, we get the following results: - Total deposits = 6,000 (100 per quarter for 15 years) - Total interest earned = 3,045.47 - Future value = 9,045.47 Therefore, the future value of the 100 quarterly deposits after 15 years, accounting for compound interest and including all the deposits made over the years, would be 9,045.47."},{"instruction":"debug it: import simpy import random import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np # Parameters num_edge_nodes = 1 edge_buffer_size = 10 cloud_buffer_size = 15 # service times cloud_server_time = 10 A_edge_service_time = 4 A_cloud_service_time = 2 B_edge_sevice_time = 2 B_cloud_service_partialprocess = 4 B_cloud_service_fullprocess = 5 propagation_delay = 1 arrival_rate = 0.8 # Measurements class Measure: def init(self, N_arr_a, N_arr_b, drop, total_queuing_delay): self.N_arr_A = N_arr_a self.N_arr_B = N_arr_b self.drop = drop self.total_queuing_delay = total_queuing_delay measurements = Measure(0, 0, 0, 0) def packet_arrivals(env, micro_data_center, cloud_data_center, data, edge_buffer, cloud_buffer, f_value): packet_type_options = [‘A’, ‘B’] packet_id = 1 while True: packet_type = random.choices(packet_type_options, weights=(1 - f_value, f_value))[0] # Updating arrival data if packet_type == “A”: data.N_arr_A = data.N_arr_A + 1 else: data.N_arr_B = data.N_arr_B + 1 arrival_time = env.now # Adding current time stamp for calculating delay if len(micro_data_center.items) < edge_buffer: if packet_type == ‘A’: micro_data_center.put((packet_id, packet_type, A_edge_service_time, arrival_time)) elif packet_type == ‘B’: micro_data_center.put((packet_id, packet_type, B_edge_sevice_time, arrival_time)) else: if len(cloud_data_center.items) < cloud_buffer: if packet_type == “A”: cloud_data_center.put((packet_id, packet_type, A_cloud_service_time + propagation_delay)) elif packet_type == “B”: cloud_data_center.put((packet_id, packet_type, B_cloud_service_fullprocess + propagation_delay)) else: data.drop = data.drop + 1 yield env.timeout(random.expovariate(arrival_rate)) packet_id += 1 def edge_node(env, micro_data_center, cloud_data_center, node_id, data): while True: packet_id, packet_type, packet_processing_time, arrival_time = yield micro_data_center.get() queuing_delay = env.now - arrival_time # Calculating delay data.total_queuing_delay += queuing_delay print(f\\"Edge Node {node_id} processed packet {packet_id} of type {packet_type} at time {env.now}“) yield env.timeout(packet_processing_time) if packet_type == ‘B’: yield cloud_data_center.put((packet_id, packet_type, B_cloud_service_partialprocess + propagation_delay)) def cloud_server(env, cloud_data_center): while True: packet_id, packet_type, packet_processing_time = yield cloud_data_center.get() yield env.timeout(packet_processing_time) print(f\\"Cloud Server processed {packet_type} packet {packet_id} (including propagation delay) at time {env.now}”) # Simulation setup #f = 0.5 # Fraction of packets of type B simtime = 100000 # Recording data average_queuing_delays = [] f_list = np.linspace(0.001, 1, 20) # Run the simulation for f in f_list: env = simpy.Environment() micro_data_center = simpy.Store(env) cloud_data_center = simpy.Store(env) env.process( packet_arrivals(env, micro_data_center, cloud_data_center, measurements, edge_buffer_size, cloud_buffer_size,f)) for node_id in range(num_edge_nodes): env.process(edge_node(env, micro_data_center, cloud_data_center, node_id + 1, measurements)) env.process(cloud_server(env, cloud_data_center)) env.run(until=simtime) average_queuing_delays.append(measurements.total_queuing_delay / (measurements.N_arr_A + measurements.N_arr_B)) plt.plot(f_list, average_queuing_delays) #plt.axvline(x=2000, color=‘red’, linestyle=‘–’) #plt.text(2000, max(losses), ‘Transition Period’, color=‘red’, va=‘bottom’, ha=‘center’) plt.xlabel(‘Different f’) plt.ylabel('Average queueing delay (time unit) ') plt.title(‘Average queueing delay over Different f’) plt.show()","output":"First, let's correct the indentation and improve the formatting of the code.

The text will define several of the most common types of malware: viruses, worms, adware, spyware, Trojan horses, bots, bugs, ransomware and rootkits. Computer Virus A virus is a form of malware that is capable of copying itself and spreading to other computers. Viruses often spread to other computers by attaching themselves to various programs and executing code when a user launches one of those infected programs. Viruses can also spread through script files, documents, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web apps. Viruses can be used to steal information, harm host computers and networks, create botnets, steal money, render advertisements, and more. 261 Worm Computer worms are among the most common types of malware. They spread over computer networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities. Worms typically cause harm to their host networks by consuming bandwidth and overloading web servers. Computer worms can also contain “payloads” that damage host computers. Payloads are pieces of code written to perform actions on affected computers beyond simply spreading the worm. Payloads are commonly designed to steal data, delete files, or create botnets. Computer worms can be classified as a type of computer virus, but there are several characteristics that distinguish computer worms from regular viruses. A major difference is that computer worms have the ability to self-replicate and spread independently while viruses rely on human activity to spread (running a program, opening a file, etc). Worms often spread by sending mass emails with infected attachments to users’ contacts. Adware Adware (short for advertising-supported software) is a type of malware that automatically delivers advertisements. Common examples of adware include pop-up ads on websites and advertisements that are displayed by software. Software and applications usually offer “free” versions that come bundled with adware. Most adware is sponsored or authored by advertisers and serves as a revenue generating tool. While some adware is solely designed to deliver advertisements, it is not uncommon for adware to come bundled with spyware that is capable of tracking user activity and stealing information. Due to the added capabilities of spyware, adware/spyware bundles are significantly more dangerous than adware on its own. Spyware Spyware is a type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge. These spying capabilities can include activity monitoring, collecting keystrokes, data harvesting (account information, logins, financial data), and more. Spyware often has additional capabilities as well, ranging from modifying security settings of software or browsers to interfering with network connections. Spyware spreads by exploiting software vulnerabilities, bundling itself with legitimate software, or in Trojans. Trojan horse A Trojan horse, commonly known as a “Trojan”, is a type of malware that disguises itself as a normal file or program to trick users into downloading and installing malware. A Trojan can give a malicious party remote access to an infected computer. Once an attacker has access to an infected computer, it is possible for the attacker to steal data (logins, financial data, electronic money), 262 install more malware, modify files, monitor user activity (screen watching, keylogging, etc.), use the computer in botnets, and anonymize internet activity by the attacker. Bot Bots are software programs created to automatically perform specific operations. While some bots are created for relatively harmless purposes (video gaming, internet auctions, online contests, etc.), it is becoming increasingly common to see bots being used maliciously. Bots can be used in botnets (collections of computers to be controlled by third parties) for DDoS attacks, as spam bots that render advertisements on websites, as web spiders that scrape server data, and for distributing malware disguised as popular search items on download sites. Websites can guard against bots with CAPTCHA tests that verify users as human. Bug In the context of software, a bug is a flaw producing an undesired outcome. These flaws are usually the result of human error and typically exist in the source code or compilers of a program. Minor bugs only slightly affect a program’s behavior and as a result can go for long periods of time before being discovered. More significant bugs can cause crashing or freezing. Security bugs are the most severe type of bugs and can allow attackers to bypass user authentication, override access privileges, or steal data. Bugs can be prevented with developer education, quality control, and code analysis tools. Ransomware Ransomware is a form of malware that essentially holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom. The malware restricts user access to the computer either by encrypting files on the hard drive or locking down the system and displaying messages that are intended to force the user to pay the malware creator to remove the restrictions and regain access to their computer. Ransomware typically spreads like a normal computer worm ending up on a computer via a downloaded file or through some other vulnerability in a network service. Rootkit A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to remotely access or control a computer without being detected by users or security programs. Once a rootkit has been installed it is possible for the malicious party behind the rootkit to remotely execute files, access/steal information, modify system configurations, alter software (especially any security software that could detect the rootkit), install concealed malware, or control the computer as part of a botnet. Rootkit prevention, detection, and removal can be difficult due to their stealthy operation. Because a rootkit continually hides its presence, typical security products are not effective in detecting and removing rootkits. As a result, rootkit detection relies on manual methods such as monitoring computer behavior for 263 irregular activity, signature scanning, and storage dump analysis. Organizations and users can protect themselves from rootkits by regularly patching vulnerabilities in software, applications, and operating systems, updating virus definitions, avoiding suspicious downloads, and performing static analysis scans.","output":"Вредоносное ПО - это сокращение от \\"вредоносное программное обеспечение\\", то есть программное обеспечение, которое может использоваться для компрометации функций компьютера, кражи данных, обхода контроля доступа или иным образом нанести вред хост-компьютеру. Текст определит несколько наиболее распространенных типов вредоносного ПО: вирусы, черви, рекламное ПО, шпионское ПО, троянские кони, боты, ошибки в программном обеспечении, программы-вымогатели и руткиты. Вирус компьютера - это форма вредоносного ПО, способная копироваться и распространяться на другие компьютеры. Вирусы часто распространяются на другие компьютеры, присоединяясь к различным программам и выполняя код, когда пользователь запускает одну из зараженных программ. Вирусы также могут распространяться через скриптовые файлы, документы и уязвимости кросс-сайтинга в веб-приложениях. Вирусы могут быть использованы для кражи информации, нанесения вреда хост-компьютерам и сетям, создания ботнетов, кражи денег, рендера рекламы и т.д. Червь компьютера - это один из наиболее распространенных типов вредоносного ПО. Он распространяется по компьютерным сетям, используя уязвимости операционной системы. Черви, как правило, наносят вред своим хост-сетям, потребляя пропускную способность и перегружая веб-серверы. Компьютерные черви также могут содержать \\"нагрузки\\", которые наносят вред компьютерам. Нагрузки - это куски кода, написанные для выполнения действий на зараженных компьютерах, кроме распространения червей. Распространенные действия для нагрузок - это кража данных, удаление файлов или создание ботнетов. Компьютерные черви могут быть классифицированы как тип компьютерных вирусов, но есть несколько характеристик, которые отличают компьютерные черви от обычных вирусов. Одно из главных отличий заключается в том, что у компьютерных червей есть способность к самовоспроизведению и самораспространению, в то время как вирусы опираются на деятельность человека для распространения (запуск программы, открытие файла и т.д.). Черви часто распространяются, отправляя массовые электронные письма с зараженными вложениями для контактов пользователей. Рекламное ПО - это тип вредоносного ПО, который автоматически размещает рекламу. Обычным примером рекламного ПО являются всплывающие объявления на веб-сайтах и реклама, которая отображается программным обеспечением. Программы и приложения обычно предлагают \\"бесплатные\\" версии, которые поставляются с рекламным ПО. Большинство рекламного ПО спонсируется или создается рекламодателями и служит инструментом для генерации доходов. Хотя некоторое рекламное ПО предназначено только для доставки рекламы, не редко рекламное ПО поставляется в связке со шпионским ПО, которое способно отслеживать действия пользователей и кражи информации. Из-за дополнительных возможностей шпионского ПО пакеты \\"рекламное ПО / шпионское ПО\\" значительно более опасны, чем рекламное ПО, работающее по отдельности. Шпионское ПО - это тип вредоносного ПО, который функционирует, следя за действиями пользователя без его ведома. Эти возможности могут включать мониторинг действий, сбор данные о нажатый клавишах, сбор информации о учетных данных, логинах, финансовых данных и т.д. Шпионское ПО часто обладает дополнительными возможносями, такими как изменение настроек безопасности программного обеспечения или браузеров, а также вмешательство в сетевые подключения. Шпионское ПО распространяется, используя уязвимости программного обеспечения, связывая с собой законное программное обеспечение или через троянов. Троянский конь, общеизвестный как \\"Троян\\", - это тип вредоносного ПО, который скрывается под обычным файлом или программой, чтобы обмануть пользователей, загрузив вредоносное ПО. Троянский конь может предоставить злоумышленнику удаленный доступ к зараженному компьютеру. Если у злоумышленника есть доступ к зараженному компьютеру, он может украсть данные (логины, финансовые данные, электронные деньги), установить больше вредоносного ПО, изменять файлы, мониторить действия пользователя (наблюдение за экраном, логгирование клавиатуры и т.п.), использовать компьютер в ботнете и анонимизировать интернет-активность злоумышленника. Боты - это программные приложения, созданные для автоматического выполнения определенных операций. В то время как некоторые боты создаются для относительно безопасных целей (видеоигры, интернет-аукционы, онлайн-конкурсы и т.д.), все чаще можно наблюдать использование ботов в злонамеренных целях. Боты могут использоваться в ботнетах (сборники компьютеров, контролируемых третьими лицами) для DDoS-атак, как спам-боты, рендерящие рекламу на веб-сайтах, как пауки для сбора данных серверов и для распространения вредоносного ПО, замаскированного в популярные поисковые запросы на сайтах загрузки. Веб-сайты могут защититься от ботов тестами CAPTCHA, которые проверяют, является ли пользователь человеком. В контексте программного обеспечения ошибка - это нежелательный результат деятельности. Эти ошибки, как правило, являются результатом человеческого фактора и обычно существуют в исходном коде или компиляторах программы. Мелкие ошибки не сильно влияют на поведение программы и могут продолжаться долгое время, прежде чем быть обнаруженными. Более серьезные ошибки могут вызывать сбои или зависания. Безопасностные ошибки являются наиболее серьезным типом ошибок и могут позволять злоумышленникам обойти аутентификацию пользователей, переопределить привилегии доступа или украсть данные. Ошибки можно предотвратить обучением разработчиков, контролем качества и программными инструментами для анализа кода. Программа-вымогатель - это форма вредоносного ПО, которое фактически захватывает компьютерную систему, требуя выкуп. Вредоносное ПО ограничивает пользователя в доступе к компьютеру, зашифровывая файлы на жестком диске или блокируя систему и отображая сообщения, которые призваны заставить пользователя заплатить создателю вредоносного ПО за удаление ограничений и восстановление доступа к компьютеру. Программа-вымогатель, как правило, распространяется как обычный компьютерный червь, в конечном итоге попадая на компьютер через загруженный файл или уязвимость в сетевой службе. Руткит - это тип злонамеренного ПО, разработанный для удаленного доступа или контроля над компьютером без обнаружения пользователями или программами безопасности. Как только руткит установлен, злоумышленник за руткитом может удаленно выполнить файлы, получить/украсть информацию, изменять настройки системы, изменять программное обеспечение (особенно любое программное обеспечение безопасности, которое может обнаружить руткит), установить скрытое вредоносное ПО или управлять компьютером как частью ботнета.

I want you to create elaborate, complex and deep lore and worldbuilding for a fictional fantasy setting. Federal Dominion of Esalnira is, on paper, a state governed by a number of representative institutions. De facto, all government authority lies in hands of Empress Maiovareia and her daughter, Co-Empress Maionareta. Post of Emperor/Empress is supposedly subjected to electoral process and its legal authority is quite limited. Until recently, it was so de facto as well. While post of emperor/empress was, in most cases, given to the relative of the previous title-holder, the de facto dynasty was a puppet of conglomerate of powerful merchant clans and guilds. Maiovareia was able to turn this situation on its head, acquiring total control over the state functions. Write long and detailed description of how such a situation happened despite numerous legal provisions, still supposedly enshrined in law, that were designed to prevent exactly that. Esalniran territory consists of heavily populated coastal region and interior full of mountain ranges, steppes and deserts. The interior is extensively used by Maiovareia for social and scientific experiments, with vast territories and even town being classified as special territories. Write long and detailed description of various attributes of Federal Dominion of Esalnira, including its banner, currency and writing system.","output":"The Federal Dominion of Esalnira is a vast and mighty realm that stretches across a diverse and sprawling world. Its lands are divided between the fertile and populous coastlines, and the rugged and desolate interior, where mountains, steppes, and deserts reign. The people of Esalnira are as varied and unique as the lands they inhabit, their cultures enriched by millennia of history, and trade, and the endless flow of ideas across their borders. But at the heart of this sprawling empire lies a story of ambition and cunning, of a singular woman who defied the odds and reshaped the very foundations of her world – Empress Maiovareia. In the centuries before her rise to power, the Federal Dominion of Esalnira was a fractured and divided realm. On paper, it was a proud and ancient institution, a federated state governed by a complex web of representative bodies, councils, and dynastic families. But behind the scenes, true power rested in the hands of a cabal of wealthy merchants, powerful guilds, and influential clans. These groups had long held sway over the Esalniran government, manipulating the election process and controlling the levers of power in a delicate balance of mutual self-interest. To maintain this balance, the merchant clans and guilds had enacted a series of complicated legal provisions designed to limit the power of the Emperor or Empress and to ensure that the post was little more than a puppet position. Traditionally, the title of Emperor or Empress was handed down to a relative of the previous office holder, but these arrangements were held in place more by custom and tradition than any strict legal code. But in a moment of opportunity and cunning, Maiovareia changed everything. A proven master of diplomacy and intrigue, Maiovareia managed to turn her initially nominal rule into a de facto dictatorship through a series of cunning strategies. First, she found the weaknesses in the venerated Esalniran legal system and exploited them through carefully orchestrated political maneuvers. This involved selectively enforcing or ignoring certain provisions and by negotiating key alliances with influential factions within the merchant clans and guilds. Simultaneously, Maiovareia turned her attention to the bureaucracy that administered the Federal Dominion. She strategically reformed and modernized the civil service, centralizing its operations in a way that allowed her to wield considerable influence over the day-to-day administration of the empire. While she took care to maintain the outward appearance of a government that respected its own legal provisions, in reality, she had taken near-total control of the state. At her side throughout her rise to power was her fiercely intelligent and capable daughter, Co-Empress Maionareta. Together, they consolidated their rule and began the task of reshaping their vast domain to suit their grand vision for their people and their lands. One of the most tangible symbols of their transformation of Esalnira was the establishment of a new national banner. This striking emblem featured the great golden eagle of the mountains, its wings outstretched as if to protect or uphold the rich and you would find me a verdant green tree that represented the fertile coastlines, while a silver crescent moon, symbolic of the vast and mysterious steppes and deserts of the interior, arched above them within a field of deep blue, representing the eternity of both their realms and their skies. As a further sign of their ambitions, Maiovareia and Maionareta instituted a new currency, the Esalniran Zalinar. This coin, minted in gold, silver, and copper, bore the noble profile of the ruling Empresses on one side and the emblem of the Federal Dominion on the other. The use of the Zalinar was heavily promoted throughout the empire, bolstering trade and unifying the disparate economic systems that had long divided their people. But perhaps the most revolutionary change the Empresses enacted was the creation of a standardized writing system for their empire. This new script, known as Maionaretan, was designed to be easy to learn and use, allowing the common people of Esalnira to more easily participate in the bureaucracies and institutions that governed their lives. In time, Empress Maiovareia and Co-Empress Maionareta also turned their attention to the untamed and underdeveloped interior of their empire. They believed that in the deserts, steppes, and mountain ranges of Esalnira lay the potential for untold prosperity and progress. To that end, they established expansive \\"special territories,\\" which were designated areas where they could conduct bold social and scientific experiments. These territories, which included entire towns and vast tracts of wilderness, were overseen by visionary academics and technocrats drawn from the Empire's universities and councils. And thus, through the indomitable will of two women, the ancient and complex world of the Federal Dominion of Esalnira was forever transformed. An empire that had once been a byword for corruption and dysfunction had been molded into a beacon of progress and unity, its people bound together by the strength that lay in their shared history, their common language, and the coiled silver coins that passed between their hands."},{"instruction":"could you write an episode of Dexter’s Laboratory called The return of Hookocho? it take place after the events of Jeepers, Creepers, Where Is Peepers.

She loved nothing more than challenging herself and achieving new heights. However, in between her adventures on the steep slopes, Madeline enjoyed a more relaxing hobby: playing video games. One day while browsing the internet, she stumbled upon a video that caught her eye. The video featured a man, with a bushy beard and a triumphant look on his face, playing a Sega Genesis on top of a mountain peak. He had managed to create a DIY battery pack that powered his gaming console, allowing him to set a world record of gaming at the highest altitude. Madeline's competitive spirit kicked in, and she exclaimed to herself, \\"I can do better than that!\\" She then quickly began brainstorming how she could not only beat the man's record but also improve upon his idea. That's when it hit her: she wanted to play her favorite gaming console, the PlayStation 1, on top of Mount Everest. Knowing she wouldn't be able to do this alone, Madeline put her thinking cap on and decided to hire none other than Bill Nye the Science Guy to help her create a powerful and efficient battery pack for her PS1. After getting in touch with the famed science educator, Madeline and Bill Nye worked tirelessly together on their pioneering project. With a groundbreaking battery pack in hand, Madeline set out on the journey to the top of Mount Everest, confident in her climbing skills and ready for the ultimate gaming session. The ascent was treacherous and filled with obstacles, but Madeline couldn't be stopped. At the summit, Madeline's eyes widened with excitement as she proudly set up her PlayStation 1, ready to game at the highest altitude to date. But just as she was about to press the \\"power\\" button, she realized something was wrong. While climbing Mount Everest, she had accidentally left her gaming console on with a disc inside, causing it to become scratched and, consequently, unreadable. The determined young woman refused to let this setback ruin her victory on Mount Everest. Realizing that climbing back down the mountain to find a new disc wasn't an option, she contacted Bill Nye the Science Guy once again, asking him for his expertise in fixing the damaged game disc. Bill Nye rose to the challenge, and after a few video-call instructions and some MacGyver-esque moves, Madeline was able to repair the scratched disc on the summit, using nothing more than some toothpaste and a soft cloth. She wiped the disc clean, inserted it into the console, and held her breath as she pressed \\"start.\\" To her delight, the PlayStation 1 booted up without issue, allowing Madeline to celebrate her historic gaming feat and setting a new world record, all while playing her favorite games, thousands of meters above sea level. From that day onward, Madeline was celebrated not only for her unmatched mountain climbing skills but also for her extraordinary problem-solving abilities and resourcefulness. She continued to adventure and explore, always finding new ways to challenge herself, with her trusty PlayStation 1 and her friend Bill Nye the Science Guy by her side.

However, both actors' agencies admit that the two are \\"very close and fond of each other\\" but maintain that they are not romantically involved. Song Jae-rim and Kim So-eun previously faced dating rumors when they shared pictures from their trips to Tokyo at the end of March. Fans in Japan discovered photos and stories of the two, adding fuel to the rumors. At the time, both parties responded by saying that Kim So-eun was traveling with the staff of her KBS2 drama \\"Three Brothers and Sisters\\" and that she and Song Jae-rim coincidentally met in Japan during their separate trips. Following the recent rumors regarding matching rose photos, a representative from Song Jae-rim's agency, Person Entertainment, told OSEN that the actors have not had any special meetings since their Japan trip, and the rose photo in question was taken at the actor's home. Meanwhile, Kim So-eun's agency, Ascendio, reiterated that they are just close friends and insisted that the simultaneous rose pictures were a coincidence. They also added that Kim So-eun was accompanied by her manager when the photo was taken.

Her recent actions have become a hot topic in online communities such as Theqoo and Women’s Generation, where posts titled \\"Noze adopted a stray dog\\" have garnered significant attention. An Instagram account named \\"Angels' Shelter\\" posted a long message along with a video featuring Noze holding the rescued dog on April 28th. The owner of the account provided background information about the dog, stating that it was one of three siblings who were rescued two months after their birth date, which was coincidentally on the same day as their mother's euthanasia. The three siblings later spent three years in the shelter, depending on each other for support. The account owner further shared that Noze is a volunteer at the shelter, and after taking the dog home, she visited \\"Angels' Shelter\\" seven times to provide care. As a result, Noze decided to adopt the dog, named Cheong-i. The account owner carefully observed Noze's affection for the dog before ultimately entrusting Cheong-i to her care, also promising that they would frequently visit the shelter together. In the accompanying video, Noze can be seen smiling warmly while holding Cheong-i. On the same day, Noze shared a cheerful photo of Cheong-i on her Instagram story. The post garnered a warm response from the online communities, with comments such as \\"Cheong-i looks much brighter now,\\" \\"Noze and the dog resemble each other,\\" \\"Noze's volunteering efforts before adopting are commendable,\\" and \\"I hope they take care of and love each other until the end.\\" Noze rose to fame as a dancer for EXO member Kai's solo song \\"Mmmh\\" in 2020. With her exceptional visuals, she received many love calls from the entertainment and advertising industries. However, she faced a backlash in July last year due to the controversy surrounding her treatment of SNS advertisers.

If so give me detailed wage calculation for a player earnings 3 million per year post tax.","output":"Let's calculate the pre-tax salary for a football player earning 3 million per year post-tax, using the example scenario provided for Lukaku: 1. Determine the percentage earned through image rights company: Assuming the player's distribution is similar to Lukaku's, 20% of their salary is paid through an image rights company. Thus, 80% of their salary is subject to regular income and NIC taxes. 2. Calculate post-tax income from image rights company: For the 20% income paid through the image rights company, the player's taxed amount is 20% (as mentioned). Hence, their post-tax income from image rights is calculated as: 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16 (16% post-tax from total income). 3. Calculate post-tax income from regular salary: For the 80% of their salary, the player is taxed 47% (45% income tax + 2% NIC), meaning that they retain 53% as post-tax income. Therefore: 0.8 * 0.53 = 0.424 (42.4% post-tax from total income). 4. Calculate total post-tax income: The sum of the post-tax income from image rights and the regular salary is: 0.16 + 0.424 = 0.584 (58.4% post-tax from total income). 5. Find the pre-tax salary: As it is given that the player's post-tax earnings amount to 3 million per year, their pre-tax salary can be calculated by dividing this amount by the total post-tax income percentage: 3,000,000 / 0.584 ≈ 5,137,000 Therefore, the football player's pre-tax salary is approximately £5,137,000 per year. If you wish to convert this annual salary into a weekly wage, simply divide the annual salary by the number of weeks in a year: 5,137,000 / 52 ≈ 98,798 Thus, the player's pre-tax weekly wage is approximately £98,798."},{"instruction":"Please rewrite the following Java Code in C# using the K&R curly braces standard: package actions; import model.Action; import model.Board; import model.DeadPool; import model.Piece; import model.PieceBag; import model.Utilities; public class CommandAction extends Action { int[] commandingSquare = new int[2]; int[] commandFromSquare = new int[2]; int[] commandToSquare = new int[2]; public CommandAction(String[] param) { // The source square is the square with the piece that uses the action.

Это позволяет Jooq создавать динамические запросы, которые можно компилировать во время выполнения. Jooq также обеспечивает более гибкий и прозрачный контроль над запросами и позволяет разработчикам работать напрямую с SQL.

Она управляет объектами Java и предоставляет удобные инструменты для выполнения запросов к БД на основе этих объектов.

This man was Lord Cedric Blackthorn, defender of the Sapphire Kingdom. One fateful day, Lord Blackthorn and his battalion ventured forth on a daring escapade, to plunder the ancient and hidden relics of a forgotten dungeon. They trekked through sun-scorched deserts and valleys of desolation, their spirits unfazed in their pursuit for treasure. As they entered the darkness of the dungeon, memories of their past victories echoed within their hearts, for they were, without doubt, victors of wars. Upon reaching the threshold of the secret chamber, the walls were adorned with runes of old, offering ritual obeisance to an ancient force. And there, in the center of the room lay a crystal of midnight hue, its raven beauty reflecting a darkness untamed. Overwhelmed by the allure of the rare stone, Lord Blackthorn reached out to touch it. In that fateful instant, the chamber came alive with an eerie glow, as the surrounding runes whispered untold curses upon the assembled warriors. As their newfound cursed lives began, the soldiers let out cries of despair as their bodies began to change in unimaginable ways. For Lord Blackthorn, his fate was stranger still. The chiseled visage and broad shoulders which had defined him as a man of war had vanished, replaced by silken tresses and a visage of ethereal beauty. Slowly, he realized that the curse had robbed him of something more than his humanity—that which had once made him a man. A woman now stood in his place, the very embodiment of grace one might find in a field of wildflowers. Shaken by this unexpected turn of events, Lady Cedrica Blackthorn could not but yearn for a cure as she stumbled from the chamber of the arcane and hallowed whispers. The need to return to familiarity—to the life that had once been hers—consumed her every thought. With a fire burning in her chest, she called on her trusted soldiers, told them of her plight, and vowed to lead them in a search for a cure to this maddening hex. Yet when they returned to the battlefield, they found that Lady Cedrica’s new form offered her talents and abilities previously unknown to her. Gone was the hard-hearted and aggressive tactician that was Lord Blackthorn. Instead, as though divine providence had laid its hand upon her brow, the woman who now held his place seemed to wield an instinct that transcended the act of war. The subtleties of strategy and the dance of diplomacy flowed from her like whispers from a masterful poet. Lady Cedrica Blackthorn found that her soldiers, no longer driven by fear of their commander, instead sought to emulate the newfound harmony their leader emanated. They moved as one, a single body entwined in the symphony of war. As the moon traced her path through the heavens, Lady Cedrica found within herself a power more formidable than any sword, a wisdom culled from the depths of her very soul. She observed the change, and knew with certainty that her newfound femininity had brought with it a guiding force that elevated her to an echelon reserved for the greatest of generals. And slowly, the yearning for a cure began to fade, replaced by the nurturing of this newfound understanding. In the days that followed, as victory after victory lay across the path like a carpet woven of triumph, Lady Cedrica Blackthorn embraced her fate and the curse that had led her there. And she, and all her soldiers, knew without a shadow of doubt that they would not trade the sage guiding them now for the wrathful commander they had once known. For in her heart, the curse had created not only a woman but the greatest commander the realm of Arganor had ever seen. In the days that followed Lady Cedrica Blackthorn’s metamorphosis, her soldiers found themselves flourishing under her guidance, and the Sapphire Kingdom began to blossom into an equilibrium that had once seemed unattainable. Lady Cedrica’s dedication to her people was unconditional, yet her nights were haunted by pensive thoughts as the weight of her new reality became heavier with each passing day. Her soldiers, who had once trembled under the iron grip of Lord Blackthorn, discovered their loyalty deepening for the commander, who had unwittingly taught them not only the art of war but the power of empathy. Realizing that their commander was struggling to navigate her newfound femininity, the soldiers decided to band together in secrecy to help her embrace her situation. They all knew that helping Lady Cedrica would only serve to strengthen their cause, and so they began a selfless quest to bring warmth and comfort into her life. Led by Lianna, the captain of the guard, they slowly assembled a network of women from throughout the kingdom - seamstresses who shared their wisdom in the creation of delicate garments, dancers who taught Lady Cedrica the enchanting language of movement, and bards who shared timeless tales to help her discover the deep well of strength and passion hidden within her. Lianna approached Lady Cedrica with this ragtag group of mentors to present her with a side to womanhood she had never known. Hesitant at first, Lady Cedrica took in the kindness and warmth radiating from her fellow women, and soon began to embrace their offering. As her friendships blossomed, she found her whole being transformed, for the pleasures of being a woman were laid out before her like a verdant meadow. She reveled in the laughter of children and the soulful bonds that connected this sisterhood. And in turn, they found solace in the guiding force she provided, her wisdom drawing them in like moths to a flame. Perhaps the most potent pleasure that arose from this metamorphosis was Lady Cedrica’s newfound connection with Thiana - an apothecary and healer, whose touch was as delicate as the petals of a rose. They would walk together through moonlit gardens, their conversations weaving through the tapestry of life. The potency of emotion and passion held within Lady Cedrica’s being found solace and comfort in the arms of Thiana, igniting a love untamed - a force that bound them together with an unyielding vigor. And so it was, as the years passed, that Lady Cedrica Blackthorn fully embraced her destiny as the foremost commander and defender of the Sapphire Kingdom. Her life was filled not only with the thunder of war, but also the sweet nectar of a woman’s love for her fellow sisters. With her soldiers and her people at her side, the Sapphire Kingdom continued to thrive, an unshakeable force that knew no walls nor boundaries. And as she sat upon her throne, her armor glinting beneath the twilight sky, Lady Cedrica Blackthorn couldn’t help but feel grateful for the curse which had opened the door to an existence she had never fathomed. For in the myriad of emotions and experiences she embraced, Lady Cedrica was given the greatest gift of all - the gift of life, in all its tumultuous and harmonious glories, allowed her to etch upon the annals of history the indelible mark of a woman who had found herself and risen to become an eternal legend.","output":"Once, amidst the grand realm of Arganor, there existed a commander of great renown, whose name was etched in the annals of history as a master of war. This man was the prince of the Sapphire Kingdom, defender of his land. One fateful day, the prince and his battalion ventured forth on a daring escapade, to plunder the ancient and hidden relics of a forgotten dungeon. They trekked through sun-scorched deserts and valleys of desolation, their spirits unfazed in their pursuit for treasure. As they entered the darkness of the dungeon, memories of their past victories echoed within their hearts, for they were, without doubt, victors of wars. Upon reaching the threshold of the secret chamber, the walls were adorned with runes of old, offering ritual obeisance to an ancient force. And there, in the center of the room lay a crystal of midnight hue, its raven beauty reflecting a darkness untamed. Overwhelmed by the allure of the rare stone, the prince reached out to touch it. In that fateful instant, the chamber came alive with an eerie glow, as the surrounding runes whispered untold curses upon the assembled warriors. As their newfound cursed lives began, the soldiers let out cries of despair as their bodies began to change in unimaginable ways. For the prince, his fate was stranger still. The chiseled visage and broad shoulders which had defined him as a man of war had vanished, replaced by silken tresses and a visage of ethereal beauty. Slowly, he realized that the curse had robbed him of something more than his humanity—that which had once made him a man. A woman now stood in his place, the very embodiment of grace one might find in a field of wildflowers. Shaken by this unexpected turn of events, the princess could not but yearn for a cure as she stumbled from the chamber of the arcane and hallowed whispers. The need to return to familiarity—to the life that had once been hers—consumed her every thought. With a fire burning in her chest, she called on her trusted soldiers, told them of her plight, and vowed to lead them in a search for a cure to this maddening hex. Yet when they returned to the battlefield, they found that the princess's new form offered her talents and abilities previously unknown to her. Gone was the hard-hearted and aggressive tactician that was the prince. Instead, as though divine providence had laid its hand upon her brow, the woman who now held his place seemed to wield an instinct that transcended the act of war. The subtleties of strategy and the dance of diplomacy flowed from her like whispers from a masterful poet. The princess found that her soldiers, no longer driven by fear of their commander, instead sought to emulate the newfound harmony their leader emanated. They moved as one, a single body entwined in the symphony of war. As the moon traced her path through the heavens, the princess found within herself a power more formidable than any sword, a wisdom culled from the depths of her very soul. She observed the change, and knew with certainty that her newfound femininity had brought with it a guiding force that elevated her to an echelon reserved for the greatest of generals. And slowly, the yearning for a cure began to fade, replaced by the nurturing of this newfound understanding. In the days that followed, as victory after victory lay across the path like a carpet woven of triumph, the princess embraced her fate and the curse that had led her there. And she, and all her soldiers, knew without a shadow of doubt that they would not trade the sage guiding them now for the wrathful commander they had once known. For in her heart, the curse had created not only a woman but the greatest defender the realm of Arganor had ever seen. In the days that followed the princess's metamorphosis, her soldiers found themselves flourishing under her guidance, and the Sapphire Kingdom began to blossom into an equilibrium that had once seemed unattainable. The princess's dedication to her people was unconditional, yet her nights were haunted by pensive thoughts as the weight of her new reality became heavier with each passing day. Her soldiers, who had once trembled under the iron grip of the prince, discovered their loyalty deepening for the commander, who had unwittingly taught them not only the art of war but the power of empathy. Realizing that their commander was struggling to navigate her newfound femininity, the soldiers decided to band together in secrecy to help her embrace her situation. They all knew that helping the princess would only serve to strengthen their cause, and so they began a selfless quest to bring warmth and comfort into her life. Led by Lianna, the captain of the guard, they slowly assembled a network of women from throughout the kingdom - seamstresses who shared their wisdom in the creation of delicate garments, dancers who taught the princess the enchanting language of movement, and bards who shared timeless tales to help her discover the deep well of strength and passion hidden within her. Lianna approached the princess with this ragtag group of mentors to present her with a side to womanhood she had never known. Hesitant at first, the princess took in the kindness and warmth radiating from her fellow women, and soon began to embrace their offering. As her friendships blossomed, she found her whole being transformed, for the pleasures of being a woman were laid out before her like a verdant meadow. She reveled in the laughter of children and the soulful bonds that connected this sisterhood. And in turn, they found solace in the guiding force she provided, her wisdom drawing them in like moths to a flame. Perhaps the most potent pleasure that arose from this metamorphosis was the princess's newfound connection with Thiana, a prince of a neighboring kingdom - whose touch was as delicate as the petals of a rose. They would walk together through moonlit gardens, their conversations weaving through the tapestry of life. The potency of emotion and passion held within the princess's being found solace and comfort in the arms of Thiana, igniting a love untamed - a force that bound them together with an unyielding vigor. And so it was, as the years passed, that the princess fully embraced her destiny as the foremost commander and defender of the Sapphire Kingdom. Her life was filled not only with the thunder of war, but also the sweet nectar of a woman's love for her fellow sisters. With her soldiers and her people at her side, the Sapphire Kingdom continued to thrive, an unshakeable force that knew no walls nor boundaries. And as she sat upon her throne, her armor glinting beneath the twilight sky, the princess couldn't help but feel grateful for the curse which had opened the door to an existence she had never fathomed. For in the myriad of emotions and experiences she embraced, the princess was given the greatest gift of all - the gift of life, in all its tumultuous and harmonious glories, allowed her to etch upon the annals of history the indelible mark of a woman who had found herself and risen to become an eternal legend."},{"instruction":"Buffy Summers and Spike are dating.

Spike's eyebrows raised in surprise, but he remained silent, waiting for Buffy's lead. \\"Buffy, I don't think this is a good idea,\\" Joyce said, clearly embarrassed by her request. \\"It's okay, Mom. We agreed to let Spike do whatever you want,\\" Buffy replied reassuringly. Joyce hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly. \\"Okay, then. If that's what you really want, Spike.\\" Spike chuckled softly before making his way over to Joyce, sitting at her feet. Buffy watched nervously as Spike removed her slippers, revealing her feet, before grabbing a nearby bowl of water and a towel. \\"Is the water too hot or too cold?\\" Spike asked gently, looking up at Joyce. \\"Um... I think it's just right,\\" Joyce replied awkwardly, her cheeks burning red with embarrassment. Spike dipped the towel into the water, wringing it out before using it to clean Joyce's feet. Buffy watched as Joyce's face slowly began to relax and she leaned back into the couch, clearly enjoying the attention. \\"You know, Spike, you're really good at this,\\" Joyce said, smiling down at him. Spike grinned up at her, his blue eyes glinting mischievously. \\"I have many talents, luv. Cleaning feet just happens to be one of them.\\" Buffy rolled her eyes at Spike's comment before turning her attention back to the TV, trying to ignore the sound of Spike's lips as he began to gently kiss and nibble on the bottom of Joyce's feet. She could hear Dawn's giggles coming from the other side of the room. As the night wore on, Buffy couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She had no idea how far Joyce would take this agreement with Spike, and she wasn't sure how much farther she was willing to let it go. The next day, Buffy pulled Spike aside, discreetly asking him what his thoughts were on the agreement with Joyce. \\"I think it's doing her some good,\\" Spike replied, his tone serious. \\"She's been lonely, Buffy. This is the first time she's smiled in weeks.\\" Buffy sighed heavily, nodding her head slowly. \\"I know, but... I don't want things to go too far. It's just... weird.\\" Spike placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. \\"I get it, Buffy. I won't let things get out of hand. I promise.\\" Time passed and Spike continued to do whatever Joyce asked of him, even when it meant rubbing her feet for hours or running her errands. Buffy tried to pretend everything was fine, but there was a growing tension within her. One night, as they all sat around the TV, Joyce made another request of Spike. \\"Spike, can you give me a massage?\\" Joyce asked, her voice tinged with need. Buffy felt like yelling 'no' but knew she had to let Joyce's wish be fulfilled. Spike nodded his head, a small smile gracing his lips. \\"Of course, Joyce. Anything for you.\\" Joyce closed her eyes and leaned back as Spike began to knead her aching muscles. Buffy could feel her stomach churn with jealousy, wishing it were her. She got up to excuse herself from the situation. After a moment, Spike stood up, placing a hand on Buffy's arm. \\"Hey, where are you going?\\" \\"I can't do this anymore, Spike,\\" Buffy whispered, tears stinging her eyes. \\"I know Mom's lonely, but this... this is too much.\\" Spike pulled her into a comforting hug. \\"I know it's hard, love. But we've got to let her be happy in her own way. Right now, this is what's making her happy.\\" Buffy nodded her head, feeling the weight of the situation heavy on her heart. She knew Spike was right. Her mother was happy, and that's all that mattered. The weeks turned into months, and Buffy slowly got used to Spike fulfilling her mother's every whim. She found that she was able to detach herself emotionally from the situation, seeing it simply as a means to an end. One day, as Spike was massaging Joyce's feet, she suddenly sat up, a huge smile on her face. \\"I've got it!\\" Joyce exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement. \\"What have you got, Joyce?\\" Spike asked, looking up at her with curiosity. \\"A new idea! We should all go on a vacation together! Just the four of us!\\" Buffy looked up from where she was sitting, her eyes widening with surprise. \\"Really, Mom?\\" \\"Yes, really! I think it would be so much fun! We could all go to Hawaii or something! What do you think, Spike?\\" Joyce asked, turning to him. Spike grinned widely, nodding his head. \\"Sounds like a bloody good idea, Joyce. Count me in.\\" Buffy couldn't help but smile as well, imagining herself lounging on a tropical beach with her family.

Joyce had always been more reserved than her daughters, never one to be direct with her wants or needs. Buffy had hoped that this plan would help her feel more comfortable in her own skin. Spike leaned forward, a surprised expression on his face. \\"Lick your feet?\\" he asked incredulously. Joyce blushed, glancing down at her slippers. \\"Well, it's just that they're sore,\\" she explained hesitantly. \\"And it would feel nice to have someone take care of them for a little while.\\" Buffy bit her lip, wondering if she had gone too far in suggesting her boyfriend for this job. Spike had been willing to do anything to make Joyce happy, but this request was rather outside of the norm. However, Spike just shrugged, a sly grin appearing on his face. \\"Sure,\\" he said easily, standing up from the couch. \\"Why not? I did promise to do anything you wanted, after all.\\" Joyce's eyes brightened, and she offered him a grateful smile. \\"Thank you so much, Spike,\\" she said with a little hesitance as if she were already expecting resistance. Spike simply smirked and dropped down to the floor at Joyce's feet, reaching down to slip off her slippers. Buffy hid a grin as she watched her mother's face light up with pleasure as Spike began to massage her feet gently. \\"That feels so good,\\" Joyce murmured, closing her eyes with a soft sigh. \\"It's been ages since anyone's done this for me.\\" Buffy and Dawn exchanged a quick glance, both of them happy to see their mother finally getting a chance to indulge in a little bit of pampering. Spike continued to work his magic, his skilled hands kneading away the stress in Joyce's feet. Buffy could tell that he was enjoying himself as well, fascinated by this new experience. \\"I can't believe you're actually doing this,\\" Dawn said with a giggle, sitting down next to Buffy on the couch. Buffy rolled her eyes, but she couldn't deny that there was something strangely heartwarming about this scene. Joyce had always been the one taking care of them, but now they were taking care of her in return. As the evening wore on, Spike remained at Joyce's feet, his focus entirely on her comfort and happiness. Buffy watched as her mother's face relaxed, the lines of tension smoothing out as she allowed herself to simply enjoy the moment. Finally, as the night started to grow late, Joyce reluctantly pulled her feet away from Spike, blushing a little at the intensity of the experience. \\"That was amazing,\\" she said softly, still feeling the relaxation humming through her veins. \\"Thank you, Spike. Thank you so much.\\" Spike simply smiled, looking pleased with himself. \\"You're welcome, Joyce,\\" he said warmly. Buffy felt a warm glow spreading through her chest as she watched the two of them. It was strange to see her mother so vulnerable, but at the same time, it was comforting to see her being cared for so lovingly. As they settled down for the night, Buffy knew that this was a memory that they would all treasure for years to come. It wasn't always easy to take care of the people you loved, but it was moments like these that made it all worthwhile."},{"instruction":"Masculinize the name Thiana","output":"Thianus"},{"instruction":"After 8 years the future value F is 12,000 if the interest rate is 16% per year compounded weekley , the present value P is","output":"Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the present value without knowing the original investment or principal amount.

And it would make me happy to see my mom happy.\\" Spike thought about it for a moment before finally nodding his head. \\"Alright, fine. I'll do it. But only because it's making you happy.\\" Buffy's face lit up with excitement. \\"Thank you, Spike. You're the best.\\" The next day, Buffy went over to her mom's house to talk to her about the plan. Joyce was surprised when Buffy told her what they had in mind. \\"You want Spike to do what?\\" Joyce asked, her eyebrows raised in disbelief. \\"Anything you want,\\" Buffy repeated. \\"No matter how weird or crazy it may seem.\\" Joyce still wasn't convinced. \\"I don't know, Buffy. It's awfully kind of him, but I don't want to be a burden to anyone.\\" \\"You're not a burden,\\" Buffy assured her. \\"We all love you and want to see you happy. Just give it a try. What's the harm?\\" After some more convincing, Joyce finally agreed to give it a go. Buffy called Spike and told him the good news. He was excited to start his new role as Joyce's personal servant. It was a week later, and Buffy, Dawn, Joyce, and Spike were all sitting in the living room watching TV. Joyce was still a bit hesitant about the whole thing, she hadn't asked Spike to do anything yet. Buffy was waiting for the perfect opportunity to bring it up. Finally, Joyce spoke up. \\"Spike, could you take off my slippers?\\" she asked him. \\"Of course, Joyce. Anything for you,\\" Spike replied as he got up to take off her slippers. Buffy and Dawn exchanged glances, both surprised at how quickly Spike jumped to fulfill Joyce's request. Once Spike had helped Joyce take off her slippers, she asked him if he could massage her feet for a while. Spike agreed and began to gently massage her feet as they all continued to watch TV. Dawn was aware of the deal Spike and Joyce had made, but she was still surprised when Joyce spoke up next. \\"Spike, could you... lick my feet for the rest of the evening?\\" Buffy and Dawn both stared at Joyce in shock. They couldn't believe what they were hearing. Spike, on the other hand, didn't seem fazed at all. \\"Of course, Joyce. Whatever you want,\\" he said as he leaned down to begin licking her feet. Buffy and Dawn tried their best to hold back their laughter as they watched Spike lick Joyce's feet, but it was too hard. They burst out laughing and Joyce couldn't help but join in. \\"I can't believe I just did that,\\" Spike said, laughing along with them. The rest of the evening was full of laughter and jokes. Spike continued to be Joyce's personal servant for the rest of the night, doing anything she asked of him. As the night came to a close, Buffy looked over at Spike with a smile on her face. \\"Thank you for doing that for my mom, Spike. You really made her happy.\\" Spike smiled back at her. \\"Anything for you, love.\\" From that day on, Spike continued to be Joyce's personal servant whenever she needed him. It may have been a strange arrangement, but it worked for them. And who knows, maybe it even brought them all a little bit closer together."},{"instruction":"小説家志望の俺の元に妹が友達三人を連れてきて、夏。 作者：成巳京 すっかり疎遠になっていたはずの妹が、なぜか友達三人を引き連れてやって来たのだけど……。 小説家志望の岸本涼一は執筆修行のためこもっていた避暑地の別荘で、夏休みに遊びに来た妹の瑞月と友人たちの世話をすることになった。すると彼女たちを迎えた初日の夜、酒に酔った涼一は相手が誰かも判断がつかないまま、その中の一人を抱いてしまうのだった。 個性豊かな彼女たちの内面には、表層からは推し量れない複雑な想いが秘められていた。振り回され惑わされ続ける、涼一のひと夏の結末は？ translate entire text as it is, re write as if human wrote it","output":"Aspiring author Ryuuichi Kishimoto had been holed up in his summer retreat to hone his writing skills when his sister, who he had grown apart from, unexpectedly showed up with three of her friends.

The text will define several of the most common types of malware: viruses, worms, adware, spyware, Trojan horses, bots, bugs, ransomware and rootkits. Computer Virus A virus is a form of malware that is capable of copying itself and spreading to other computers. Viruses often spread to other computers by attaching themselves to various programs and executing code when a user launches one of those infected programs. Viruses can also spread through script files, documents, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web apps. Viruses can be used to steal information, harm host computers and networks, create botnets, steal money, render advertisements, and more. Worm Computer worms are among the most common types of malware. They spread over computer networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities. Worms typically cause harm to their host networks by consuming bandwidth and overloading web servers. Computer worms can also contain “payloads” that damage host computers. Payloads are pieces of code written to perform actions on affected computers beyond simply spreading the worm. Payloads are commonly designed to steal data, delete files, or create botnets. Computer worms can be classified as a type of computer virus, but there are several characteristics that distinguish computer worms from regular viruses. A major difference is that computer worms have the ability to self-replicate and spread independently while viruses rely on human activity to spread (running a program, opening a file, etc). Worms often spread by sending mass emails with infected attachments to users’ contacts. Adware Adware (short for advertising-supported software) is a type of malware that automatically delivers advertisements. Common examples of adware include pop-up ads on websites and advertisements that are displayed by software. Software and applications usually offer “free” versions that come bundled with adware. Most adware is sponsored or authored by advertisers and serves as a revenue generating tool. While some adware is solely designed to deliver advertisements, it is not uncommon for adware to come bundled with spyware that is capable of tracking user activity and stealing information. Due to the added capabilities of spyware, adware/spyware bundles are significantly more dangerous than adware on its own. Spyware Spyware is a type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge. These spying capabilities can include activity monitoring, collecting keystrokes, data harvesting (account information, logins, financial data), and more. Spyware often has additional capabilities as well, ranging from modifying security settings of software or browsers to interfering with network connections. Spyware spreads by exploiting software vulnerabilities, bundling itself with legitimate software, or in Trojans. Trojan horse A Trojan horse, commonly known as a “Trojan”, is a type of malware that disguises itself as a normal file or program to trick users into downloading and installing malware. A Trojan can give a malicious party remote access to an infected computer. Once an attacker has access to an infected computer, it is possible for the attacker to steal data (logins, financial data, electronic money), install more malware, modify files, monitor user activity (screen watching, keylogging, etc.), use the computer in botnets, and anonymize internet activity by the attacker. Bot Bots are software programs created to automatically perform specific operations. While some bots are created for relatively harmless purposes (video gaming, internet auctions, online contests, etc.), it is becoming increasingly common to see bots being used maliciously. Bots can be used in botnets (collections of computers to be controlled by third parties) for DDoS attacks, as spam bots that render advertisements on websites, as web spiders that scrape server data, and for distributing malware disguised as popular search items on download sites. Websites can guard against bots with CAPTCHA tests that verify users as human. Bug In the context of software, a bug is a flaw producing an undesired outcome. These flaws are usually the result of human error and typically exist in the source code or compilers of a program. Minor bugs only slightly affect a program’s behavior and as a result can go for long periods of time before being discovered. More significant bugs can cause crashing or freezing. Security bugs are the most severe type of bugs and can allow attackers to bypass user authentication, override access privileges, or steal data. Bugs can be prevented with developer education, quality control, and code analysis tools. Ransomware Ransomware is a form of malware that essentially holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom. The malware restricts user access to the computer either by encrypting files on the hard drive or locking down the system and displaying messages that are intended to force the user to pay the malware creator to remove the restrictions and regain access to their computer. Ransomware typically spreads like a normal computer worm ending up on a computer via a downloaded file or through some other vulnerability in a network service. Rootkit A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to remotely access or control a computer without being detected by users or security programs. Once a rootkit has been installed it is possible for the malicious party behind the rootkit to remotely execute files, access/steal information, modify system configurations, alter software (especially any security software that could detect the rootkit), install concealed malware, or control the computer as part of a botnet. Rootkit prevention, detection, and removal can be difficult due to their stealthy operation. Because a rootkit continually hides its presence, typical security products are not effective in detecting and removing rootkits. As a result, rootkit detection relies on manual methods such as monitoring computer behavior for irregular activity, signature scanning, and storage dump analysis. Organizations and users can protect themselves from rootkits by regularly patching vulnerabilities in software, applications, and operating systems, updating virus definitions, avoiding suspicious downloads, and performing static analysis scans.

The study evaluates various personalized learning methodologies, including differentiated instruction, rapid assessment and feedback, individualized learning paths, and project-based learning. By examining the implementation of AI-powered personalized learning across 62 public schools, the research sheds light on how adjusting the learning experience to each student's unique needs can potentially enhance their academic performance. One key finding from the study is the influence of AI-driven rapid assessment and feedback tools on students' academic outcomes. By promptly identifying learners' strengths and weaknesses, these tools enable educators to provide individualized support and adapt their instructional approaches effectively. Consequently, AI can help tackle the challenges faced in traditional educational settings, where teachers often struggle to address the diverse needs of all students due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, the use of AI in the learning process not only helps to optimize learning but also fosters a more inclusive and learner-centered approach. However, the implementation of AI-powered personalized learning strategies is not without challenges. Schools and educators face hurdles, such as limited resources, adapting to new roles and teaching methods, and striking the right balance between individualization and collaboration among students. Despite these challenges, the RAND Corporation's research highlights the potential of AI to revolutionize education by improving the learning experience for students and, in turn, their academic achievements.

The authors, Paula Trepainer, Gabriel L. Oliveira, and Alneu de Andrade Lopes, propose a flexible and adaptable framework that utilizes both supervised and reinforcement deep learning approaches to learn optimal strategies in the game. This research paper aims to improve our understanding of decision-making mechanisms in strategic games through the application of deep learning techniques. The framework presented in this study consists of two primary learning stages: (1) a supervised learning stage where a large dataset of expert Dominoes games is used to train a double-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and (2) a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes game strategies through self-play and Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP). The CNN serves as the foundation for the agents to predict their strategies from the given game states. Meanwhile, the NFSP method enhances agents' learning capabilities through a combination of reinforcement and supervised learning, using best responses from simulated games. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based framework effectively learns meaningful strategies in the game of Dominoes. Moreover, the findings highlight the potential of combining supervised and reinforcement learning approaches to optimize game play performance in strategic games.

By stimulating various sensory channels, multisensory teaching techniques can lead to improved comprehension, retention, and overall learning performance. The article also explores the role of technologies, such as audio books, talking dictionaries, and text-to-speech software, in supporting multisensory experiences for dyslexic students. In summary, the article highlights the importance of using a multisensory approach to address the specific needs of dyslexic learners and improve their academic performance, particularly in developing reading skills. It encourages educators and stakeholders to incorporate these strategies into the educational system, along with appropriate technologies, to create more inclusive learning environments that cater to the diverse needs of all students, including those with learning disabilities such as dyslexia."},{"instruction":"take this article: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ail2.53","output":"The article titled \\"Bridging the Gap: A Pragmatic Approach to Generating Insider Threat Data\\" addresses the challenges associated with generating data for insider threat analysis and proposes a pragmatic approach for creating such data. The authors, William Streilein, Joshua Glasser, William Frantz, Christopher Street, and Pratyusa Manadhata, present a comprehensive discussion on the difficulties faced while collecting real-world insider threat data and introduce a methodology that aims to bridge the gap between research and practical application in detecting insider threats. One of the primary concerns when dealing with insider threat data is the sensitivity of the information involved. Organizations are often reluctant to share data due to privacy and legal concerns, and researchers are left with limited resources to develop and test techniques for detecting potential insider threats. To address this issue, the study proposes a novel approach that leverages synthetic and heterogeneous datasets derived from multiple sources to construct anonymized, high-quality data for insider threat analysis. The authors' pragmatic approach involves using anonymized network host-level data and joining it with synthetic user behavior data to create realistic, yet anonymity-preserving records. The goal is to produce a dataset that mimics real-world situations, allowing researchers to develop and test their insider threat detection methods effectively. The article also describes the design, construction, and verification of the first versions of the dataset that demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach. In conclusion, this article addresses a critical challenge in the field of insider threat research by proposing a pragmatic approach to generating realistic data for analysis. By bridging the gap between research and practice, the authors' methodology can potentially contribute to more effective and accurate detection of insider threats, ultimately enhancing cybersecurity measures in organizations."},{"instruction":"take this areticle: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1297682.pdf","output":"The article titled \\"An Exploration of the Relationship between Technology and Flipped Learning\\" investigates the connection between technology use and the implementation of flipped learning in education.

Е. Салтыкова-Щедрина (показать на примере одной из сказок)","output":"Добрый день, уважаемые коллеги и гости нашей презентации. Сегодня мы будем говорить о сатире и иронии, которые пронизывают сказки М. Е. Салтыкова-Щедрина - выдающегося писателя и сатирика русской литературы XIX века. Одной из его наиболее известных сказок, является \\"История одного города\\", которая наполнена множеством иронических и сатирических образов. Сюжет начинается со знаменитого дворянина Федора Шешкова, который считал, что его город является самым прекрасным и лучшим в России. Однако, читатель сразу понимает, что это не так и что город настолько отсталый, что дома там строятся вместе с мусором, а воду из реки люди пьют просто потому, что иначе им нечего пить. Таким образом, сатира и ирония в сказке М. Е. Салтыкова-Щедрина действуют как разрушительный фактор, который ставит под сомнение искаженные и безумные взгляды на жизнь определенных людей и общественных групп. Он никогда не принимал то, что было очевидно и являлся связующим звеном между реальностью и идеалами, которые необходимо следовать. В заключение, мы можем с уверенностью сказать, что сатира и ирония в сказках М. Е. Салтыкова-Щедрина не только позволяют нам рассмеяться, но и помогают увидеть проблемы нашего мира из иной, непредвзятой и зачастую остроумной точки зрения. Эти сказки сегодня, как и ранее, остаются актуальными и дополнительным подтверждением того, что ирония и сатира в литературе - это не просто смешные штуки для развлечения наших умов. Это глубокая мысль об окружающем мире и нас самих. Спасибо!"},{"instruction":"распиши поподробнее о сатире и иронии в сказках Салтыкова-Щедрина","output":"М. Е. Салтыков-Щедрин является одним из крупнейших сатириков и ироников русской литературы XIX века. В его сказках сатира и ирония используются для обличения социальных недостатков и пороков и обнаружения скрытых противоречий в русском обществе своего времени. В сказках Салтыкова-Щедрина сюжет и персонажи могут казаться на первый взгляд несерьезными и почти забавными, но под этой внешней легкостью скрывается острый сатирический и иронический подтекст. С помощью парадоксов, неожиданных поворотов событий, смешных ситуаций и образов, писатель показывает недостатки и проблемы общества того времени. Сатира Салтыкова-Щедрина основывается на раскрытии в смешной форме высшей опасности использования пустых слов и бессмысленных высказываний, когда слова не соответствуют поступкам, а обещания оказываются пустыми. Например, в сказке \\"История одного города\\" шеф-архитектор города, описывающий проект новой улицы, использует выражения, изобилие терминов и терминологических оборотов, но в конце концов результатом оказывается небрежно закинутый песоки, грязь и сплошное негодование жителей. Ирония же Салтыкова-Щедрина проявляется на разных уровнях. Например, на уровне сюжета его сказки могут описывать типичные истории из жизни обычных людей и пародировать определенное явление или традицию. Но на самом деле ирония и неожиданные повороты сюжета часто имеют глубокий смысл и направлены на раскрытие социальных проблем. Например, в сказке \\"Облако в штанах\\" Салтыков-Щедрин описывает почти фантастическую и нелепую историю, но через эту иронию и смех он поднимает серьезные вопросы о природе человеческих чувств и призывает человечество к более взвешенному и осознанному поведению в обществе. Таким образом, сатира и ирония в сказках М. Е. Салтыкова-Щедрина не просто являются средствами рассказывания смешных историй, а позволяют писателю выявлять социальные проблемы, раскрывать лживость общественных установок и показывать читателям истинную природу происходящего."},{"instruction":"Маркетинговые исследования и ситуационный анализ в B2B и B2C секторах, простыми словами для экзамена коротко","output":"Маркетинговые исследования - это процесс изучения рынка и потребителей, с целью сбора информации о продуктах и услугах, а также о конкурентах и трендах.

In the world of Ghallenreya, the ancient civilisation of Ugarit was changed forever in 6000 BC when a spontaneous invasion of the city by alien beings from the Shuff world struck. King Ammu-Harrasi managed to negotiate with the aliens, agreeing to supply them with slaves and meet their other demands in exchange for modern, high-tech weapons. Armed in this way, the Ugaritic kingdom experienced a rapid and rapid period of expansion. By 5500 BC, the Ugarites, using their advanced technology, had absorbed the developing Greco-Roman civilisations, completely changing the course of their development. By 5000 BC. The Ugaritic Empire completely dominated the Middle East, Africa and Egypt, resulting in a vast and unique global power that had existed for thousands of years before Christ. Instead of the Abrahamic religions that would have otherwise flourished, the Ugaritic kingdom adopted a kargo cult dedicated to the worship of alien relics and the remaining technology provided by the Shaffians. This unusual and futuristic belief served to further unify and strengthen the Ugaritic Empire. By 3500 BC, late Hellenistic geotheism had led to the emergence of monotheism, most reminiscent of the fusion of Zoroastrianism and Hinduism. This new Aryan religion of monotheism began to spread throughout the empire, effectively supplanting the Kargo cult. c. 2500 BC: New World- The development of agriculture, the domestication of animals and the development of pottery enabled the indigenous peoples of the Americas to lay the foundations for complex societies. However, in this world, the power of the Ugaritic Empire began to wane after the last alien visit. Its influence waned as competing powers gradually emerged around the world. 1237 AD: The Golden Horde invades and conquers China, Eastern Europe and various territories in Central Asia, becoming a formidable power. c. A.D. 1428: New World- The Triple Alliance, or Aztec Empire, is founded and comes to dominate the valley of Mexico and eventually much of Mesoamerica. c. 1500 Г. AD: New World- Old World explorers stumble upon the New World, but their influence is limited as already advanced Native American civilisations manage to resist colonisation and repel explorers. 1600s: Austro-Germany begins its ascent to power as an alliance of Germanic and Austrian territories, eventually conquering European rivals, including Great Britain, and establishing dominance on the continent. 1600: The Golden Horde experiences a series of revolutions, transforming into the Golden Horde Union - a socialist state resembling the Soviet Union - and focusing on the production, distribution and consumption of the drug spice Ilm Saresh. In this world, the absence of European conquest and colonisation allows Native American civilisations to develop more organically and without interference, resulting in a very different political and cultural dynamic. 1500-1600 YEARS OUR EAR: New World- As Native civilizations flourish, trade routes between powerful city-states and empires on the American continent expand. 1600-1700 YEARS OUR ERA: New World- The development of the navy and shipbuilding technology allows the Inca empire in the south to establish trade routes between their coastal territories in the Pacific and their Mesoamerican counterparts, forming a new transcontinental trading network. 1770: Austro-German rather than British explorers arrive in Australia and claim the continent. Systematic colonisation soon follows and Australia benefits from Austro-German technological and military advances. 1800s: Further revolutions and resistance movements in China lead to the collapse of the Golden Horde Union control and the establishment of the socialist Republic of China. An alliance is formed between the Golden Horde Union and the Republic of China. Africa becomes less attractive to European colonial ambitions due to the changed power dynamics in GhallenReya. Consequently, there is less direct colonisation on the continent and more economic exploitation through trade. 1700-1800 A.D.: The New World-United Mesoamerican Empire (UAE) is formally formed in response to the threat of foreign invasions. Meanwhile, the peoples of the Pacific Islands experience a moderate increase in contact with New World civilisations. Moving back to the 19th century, in Western Europe the Industrial Revolution spread across the continent. It was strongest in the Austro-German region, which became a highly militarised state on the brink of conflict. 1800-1900 YEARS OUR ERA: New World- Nations in the Americas focus on infrastructure development, technological advancement and urbanisation as the continent's population rises dramatically. 1901: The Commonwealth of Australia forms under Austro-German rule, developing its economy and regional presence in the Pacific. 1914-1918: World War I breaks out, with Australia fighting on the side of Austria-Germany. The conflict further strengthens their ties and solidifies Australia's role as a rising power in the region. 1900-1920: The Kingdom of Japan becomes increasingly imperialistic with a parliamentary government, joining forces with Austria-Germany, the NAIC and the United Mesoamerican Empire in opposition to the Golden Horde Union and the Republic of China. 1920: Africa becomes the main area of interest and investment for the Ugaritic Empire. Australia, supported by Austria-Germany, also turns its attention to Africa in search of trade and resource opportunities. As a result, the African continent is experiencing a new wave of foreign influence and power struggles that differs sharply from its traditional colonial history. By 1920, the world was divided between several major powers: the Ugaritic Empire, which continued to cling to life while maintaining limited control over a handful of territories in the Middle East and North Africa; the formidable and expanding Golden Horde; the Native American peoples, who successfully resisted European colonisation; and the industrialised and militarised state of Austro-Germany, ready to shift the balance of power in the world once again. The absence of Islam, Judaism and Christianity dramatically changed the cultural and political dynamics around the world - Aryan monotheism, serpentism and anti-serpentism, as well as the lingering remnants of the alien-worshiping Kargo cult (Fiendaropokloniki), now dominated the spiritual landscape. 1900-1920 A.D.: New World- The absence of European domination of the American continent leads to small indigenous peoples consolidating and uniting into larger and more powerful blocks, resulting in a complex interaction between the Inca civilisation (Confederation of Tauantinsuyu), the OME and other regional powers. This is a time of turbulent peace; the established powers must now confront the increasingly militarised states of Europe and Asia as they seek to maintain their independence and influence in the face of rapid development. Some of the states are: 1. the United Mesoamerican Empire ('OME') - Mexican-Mayan Alliance: a confederation of formerly independent states headed by a council composed of representatives from each member state. The council makes decisions by consensus and elects a paramount chief from among its members as leader of the alliance. 2. Tauantinsuyu Confederation: A centralised federation headed by a Sapa Inka who inherits the title from his predecessor. The Sapa Inka rules through a bureaucratic system and is considered both a secular and divine ruler. 3. The Golden Horde Union (GHU) is a state very similar to the Soviet Union, resulting from a series of revolutionary actions and the overthrow of the old ruling class. The government is a centrally planned socialist state headed by a general secretary who runs a one-party system. The chemical industry is very well developed. First to use mustard gas for military purposes. Is the centre of the world drug industry. Their economy largely revolves around the extraction and export of a powerful, mind-enhancing spice derived from mushrooms called \\"Ilm Saresh\\" (from the Turkic words ilim - knowledge and ushresh - fruit). This valuable commodity enhances intellect, memory, attention and reaction rate, but at the cost of a serious reduction in life expectancy. The historic capital is Sarai-Batu, but after the revolution the centre of power shifted to Samarkand. Territorial location by 1920: covers most of Eurasia and includes territories corresponding to modern countries such as: - Russia (excluding western European parts) - Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan) - Caucasus region (including Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia) - Eastern Europe (including Ukraine, Belarus and small parts of Poland and Hungary) - Mongolia. Strengthening the armed forces and ensuring technological superiority are crucial to the strategic objectives of the Golden Horde Union as it seeks to defend its territory and influence against such adversaries as Austria-Germany, the NAIC, the Kingdom of Japan and the United Mesoamerican Empire. The Golden Horde Union seeks to promote socialism throughout the region, creating a network of socialist and communist allies to expand its sphere of influence and create a counterweight to opposing power blocs. Addiction to ilm saresh is spreading worldwide as the demand for the mind-enhancing abilities that ilm saresh provides takes precedence over fears of its life-shortening side effects. Widespread addiction further underscores the power of the Golden Horde Union, shaping the cultural, economic and political landscape of the early 20th century world. 4. The Native American Indigenous Coalition (NAIC) is a loose alliance of tribes and confederations of First Nations living in the present-day territories of the United States and Canada. Each group retains its traditional form of government, with a comprehensive council for inter-tribal diplomacy and mutual defence. 5. Austro-German Empire: A highly industrialised, militarised constitutional monarchy. A dual monarchy governed by one monarch representing both Austria and Germany, who rules together with a parliament composed of representatives from both countries. 6. Chinese Social Democratic Republic: A social democratic republic formed after the fall of the Golden Horde's control of China. The government is a planned socialist state 7. Kingdom of Japan: An imperial monarchy with a parliamentary government. The emperor holds largely symbolic office and the parliament exercises executive power. 8. Ugaritic Empire - An imperial monarchy that continues to cling to life while maintaining limited control over a handful of territories in the Middle East and North Africa. 9. Commonwealth of Australia - formed in 1901 under Austro-German rule, developing its economy and regional presence in the Pacific. By 1920 it becomes a significant world power, particularly interested in Africa In this world, the Golden Horde Union becomes the centre of the world drug industry.

The first historical capital of the Ugaritic Empire is Ugarit itself. 5500 BC: The developing Greco-Roman civilizations are absorbed by the Ugaritic Empire, which is equipped with advanced alien technology. The Ugaritic Empire continues its territorial expansion, and the second historical capital becomes Mycenae, signaling the absorption of the early Greek peoples. By 5000 BC: The Ugaritic Empire has completely dominated the Middle East, North Africa, and Egypt. The Empire sets its third historical capital in Memphis, which demonstrates the absorption and integration of the ancient Egyptian civilization. 3500 BC: Late Hellenistic geotheism leads to the emergence of monotheism, a fusion of Zoroastrianism and Hinduism. This new Aryan religion spreads throughout the empire, replacing the Kargo cult. The Empire adopts a fourth historical capital, the city of Babylon, to further signify its dominion over Mesopotamia and the Middle Eastern regions. As the Empire grows and consolidates power, migrations still occur, and populations mix within different regions of the Empire. Different cultures and people contribute to a constantly evolving and diverse society within the Ugaritic Empire. 2500 BC: The Ugaritic Empire's influence begins to wane, paralleled by the rise of other major powers and civilizations around the world. Ugarit remains the symbolic center of the Empire, but much of its direct power and control over regions and peoples diminish. By 1920 AD: The Ugaritic Empire's reach has drastically declined, with limited control over a handful of territories in the Middle East and North Africa. Despite its once-global dominance, the Ugaritic Empire now occupies a much smaller position on the world stage alongside the Golden Horde Union, Native American civilizations, and the industrialized and militarized state of Austro-Germany.

The first historical capital is Ugarit in the Middle East. 5500 BC: The Ugaritic Empire absorbs Mycenae, an early center of Greek civilization. As a result, cities throughout Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean develop Ugaritic origins, with a blend of local Hellenistic culture. 5000 BC - 3500 BC: Ugaritic language and influence permeate throughout Europe as the Empire broadens its reach, leading to the establishment of various Ugaritic-influenced cities in the regions that include modern-day Iberian Peninsula, southern France, and Italy. 3500 BC: Aryan monotheism, an amalgamation of Zoroastrianism and Hinduism, replaces the Kargo cult and spreads throughout the Ugaritic territories, encompassing Europe, Asia, and Africa. 2500 BC - 1237 AD: The Ugaritic Empire's power declines as its influence wanes across Europe and Asia. Other powers emerge, specifically, the Golden Horde in Asia, which would significantly impact European geopolitics. 1237 AD: The Golden Horde invades and conquers China, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia.

Ancient Japan: The early history of Japan saw the emergence of the first Japanese state called Yamato, which would later develop into a centralized imperial court. The native Shinto religion played a central role in the cultural and political lives of ancient Japan. Heian period (794 to 1185 AD): Kyoto became the capital city of Japan, a position it would maintain for over a thousand years. The refined culture of the imperial court flourished during this time, producing celebrated works of literature and art. Feudal Japan (1185 to 1868 AD): Japan transitioned into an era characterized by feudal lords or daimyos, who exerted considerable influence over their territories. The military governments of Kamakura (first shogunate) and later Ashikaga Shogunate (Muromachi period) dictated the political landscape during these centuries, with samurai warriors playing a significant role in Japanese society. Edo Period (1603 to 1868 AD): Tokugawa shogunate centralized power and ruled with a strict hierarchical system, ushering in a period of stability and strict isolation from the outside world. The city of Edo, modern-day Tokyo, became the political center of the country, although Kyoto remained the official and cultural capital. Meiji Restoration (1868 to 1912 AD): The Emperor Meiji regained political power, overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate.

Feudal Japan (1185 - 1868 AD): During the feudal era, Japan started engaging in trade and diplomatic relations with external powers. The influence of Austria-Germany, though relatively minimal at this stage, began to have an impact as Japan adapted some of their technological advancements, such as weaponry and shipbuilding. Late Edo period (19th century): During the time of Japan's isolation (sakoku policy), the nation was still indirectly influenced by global powers like Austria-Germany, driven by curiosity and the need for modernization. Meanwhile, the growing influence of the Golden Horde Union in Asia created a sense of urgency for Japan to strengthen its military and economic power to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Meiji Restoration (1868 - 1912 AD): With the restoration of the Emperor's power, Japan actively sought to modernize by adopting Western ideas, institutions, and technologies. Learning from the powerful Austria-Germany, Japan focused on industrialization, military advancements, and the establishment of a centralized, modernized government. By 1920, the Kingdom of Japan was a rising global power. As it aligned itself with Austria-Germany and other nations during World War I, Japan expanded its sphere of influence and territory.

Background Our company has been producing multiple posts per day for different social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. While this approach has given us decent visibility, the engagement with our audience hasn't lived up to expectations. Our internal analysis shows that users are often overwhelmed or fatigued by the high frequency of our posts, which in turn reduces overall engagement. Moreover, constantly pushing out multiple pieces of content per day has put a strain on our marketing team, causing them to have less time to focus on crafting high-quality, engaging content that furthers the company's goals. Acceptance Criteria 1. I'll meet with the social media marketing team to discuss our current marketing strategy, and convey the objectives of reducing to 1 post per day and improving the quality of our content. 2. We will gather analytics data from all our social media channels and analyze the performance of our posts in terms of engagement, click-throughs, and conversions. 3. Based on this analysis, we will identify one high-performing content type and adjust our content strategy accordingly with an aim to emphasize the quality of our daily post over its quantity. 4. Our internal designer will work closely with the team to create a visually appealing and on-brand template for our posts, ensuring consistency and professionalism across all platforms. 5. We will monitor the performance of our new approach, tracking key metrics such as reach, engagement, and conversions to ensure this shift is having a positive impact on our marketing goals. Notes - The transition to one post per day should reduce stress on the marketing team and allow time for creativity and innovation in their approach. - Optimizing our content posting schedule should increase the quality of our content, helping our brand stand out in a crowded social media landscape."},{"instruction":"authRouter.post(\\"/login\\", async (req, res) => { try { const user = await User.findOne({ username: req.body.username, }); if (!user) { return res .status(401) .json({ message: \\"Incorrect username or password\\" }); } let hashedPassword = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt( user.password, process.env.PASSWORD_SECRET || \\"\\" ); let userPassword = hashedPassword.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8); if (userPassword !== req.body.password) { return res .status(401) .json({ message: \\"Incorrect username or password\\" }); } const accessToken = jwt.sign( { id: user.id, isAdmin: user.isAdmin }, process.env.JWT_SECRET , { expiresIn: \\"3d\\" } ); const { password, ...others } = user.toObject(); res.status(200).json({ others, accessToken }); } catch (err) { console.error(err); res.status(500).json({ message: \\"There was a problem logging in.

They can record the loan of a copy when there is a reservation for that particular title, provided that the user’s loan limits are met and that no returns are delayed. They also record loans without reservations, by searching for the user and title, if the user meets the loan criteria mentioned above and if there are available copies. o All school students, as well as the professors, can register and use the system. Approval from Operator is required for registration. After approving each user, the Operator prints out the borrower’s card and delivers it to the user. Additionally, the Operator is authorized to delete or disable user accounts in accordance with the library’s policy. Educators have the ability to modify their personal information, while students are only able to view it. • Book borrowing: Each user of the system, at the level of the school unit, can view available books, evaluate them and request to borrow a copy. Each student user can borrow up to two books per week, while professors can borrow one per week. Borrowing/returning of books is handled by the Operator. In case a copy of the book is not available, the user’s request (reservation) is put on hold and is served upon the return of a copy. • Reservations: Regarding reservations, the borrowing limits apply, e.g., two reservations per week for students. A reservation cannot be made if a book has not been returned on time or if the same user has already borrowed the title. Users have the option to cancel any current reservations. Additionally, reservations have a time frame of one week and are automatically canceled once it expires. • Reviews: Users can share their thoughts about a book in a written review and provide a rating using the Likert2 scale. Reviews written by students will be published upon approval by the Operator. In addition to inputting the aforementioned information, all users of the application must have the ability to manage information, including a search mechanism and options for updating or deleting it (CRUD).","output":"Below is the DDL script with appropriate indexes and constraints for the given description: \`\`\`sql CREATE TABLE Schools ( SchoolID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, SchoolName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, Address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, City VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE, Email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, DirectorFullName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, SchoolLibraryOperatorFullName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Books ( BookID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, Publisher VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, ISBN VARCHAR(13) NOT NULL UNIQUE, NumberOfPages INT, Summary TEXT, AvailableCopies INT NOT NULL, Image VARCHAR(255), Language VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL ); CREATE INDEX idx_books_title ON Books(Title); CREATE INDEX idx_books_publisher ON Books(Publisher); CREATE INDEX idx_books_language ON Books(Language); CREATE TABLE Authors ( AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, AuthorFullName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Categories ( CategoryID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, ThematicCategory VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE Users ( UserID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, UserType ENUM('Administrator', 'Operator', 'Student', 'Professor') NOT NULL, Username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, Password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL -- Additional fields for personal information based on UserType can be added ); CREATE TABLE BookAuthors ( BookAuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, BookID INT NOT NULL, AuthorID INT NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID), FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID) ); CREATE TABLE BookCategories ( BookCategoryID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, BookID INT NOT NULL, CategoryID INT NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID), FOREIGN KEY (CategoryID) REFERENCES Categories(CategoryID) ); CREATE INDEX idx_bookauthors_bookid ON BookAuthors(BookID); CREATE INDEX idx_bookauthors_authorid ON BookAuthors(AuthorID); CREATE INDEX idx_bookcategories_bookid ON BookCategories(BookID); CREATE INDEX idx_bookcategories_categoryid ON BookCategories(CategoryID); CREATE TABLE BookTransactions ( TransactionID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, UserID INT NOT NULL, BookID INT NOT NULL, TransactionType ENUM('Borrow', 'Reserve') NOT NULL, TransactionDate DATE NOT NULL, DueDate DATE, ReturnDate DATE, FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID), FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Books(BookID) ); CREATE INDEX idx_booktransactions_userid ON BookTransactions(UserID); CREATE INDEX idx_booktransactions_bookid ON BookTransactions(BookID); CREATE INDEX idx_booktransactions_transactiontype ON BookTransactions(TransactionType); CREATE INDEX idx_booktransactions_transactiondate ON BookTransactions(TransactionDate); \`\`\` These scripts include table structures, primary keys, unique constraints, foreign keys, ENUM data type for UserType and TransactionType, and necessary indexes for query performance optimization.

Gasps filled the air as murmurs traveled through the crowd. Lilac, the brave dragon girl from Freedom Planet, couldn't help but giggle in excitement. Freddy Fazbear, the animatronic bear from Five Nights at Freddy's, adjusted his bowtie nervously. Kakashi stood in the center of the group, his stern gaze scanning the excited characters gathered around him. He hesitated for a moment, wanting this to be perfect. Sharing a nod with his Naruto companions - Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke - he began the much-anticipated reveal. With one swift motion, he pulled down his mask, revealing his handsome and scarred face. Everyone stared, amazed by Kakashi's unveiled appearance. His visible silver hair and strong jawline made every person in the crowd swoon. Sharing a smile with his closest friends, Kakashi looked proud and relieved. Lilac's eyes widened in awe, her blush matching the tone of her hair. Freddy Fazbear stuttered and stammered, not knowing how to react. Izuku Midoriya from My Hero Academia found himself covering his blushing face with his hands, incredibly flustered. His classmates, Uraraka and Iida, mirrored his reaction, with Uraraka rather shyly staring at her feet and Iida attempting to maintain his composure. Even characters like Sasuke and Bakugo, who were usually difficult to impress, found themselves blushing in awe of Kakashi's good looks. Naruto playfully nudged Sasuke, offering a smug grin that only made Sasuke's blush deepen. The atmosphere suddenly shifted from excitement to a tinge of shyness. The embarrassment radiating from everyone was palpable, but Kakashi only smiled warmly, feeling more connected to his newfound friends than ever before. They had faced countless battles together, and now they shared this intimate moment — a symbolic victory itself. Kakashi raised his hand and waved, snapping everyone out of their daze. He laughed softly before narrowing his eyes and barking orders at everyone. \\"Alright, let's not forget why we're here. We still have work to do!\\" And just like that, the moment was over.

Nous vivons dans une époque où les avancées technologiques sont fulgurantes, et cela inclut l'intelligence artificielle et les machines capables de dessiner et de créer des œuvres d'art. Cependant, je suis fermement convaincue qu'un vrai artiste ne sera jamais remplacé par ces innovations. L'art est avant tout une question d'émotion et de ressenti. C'est une expression de soi, un moyen de raconter une histoire ou de transmettre un message. Il existe des milliers de styles différents, des œuvres d'art de toutes formes, de toutes couleurs, de toutes textures. Chaque artiste a sa propre voix, sa propre vision, son propre style. Quand on contemple une œuvre d'art, on voit l'âme de son créateur, on ressent son inspiration et sa passion. Il est vrai que l'intelligence artificielle peut être utilisée pour créer des images et des dessins qui semblent à première vue incroyablement réalistes et détaillés. Cependant, il manque une chose essentielle : l'âme. L'intelligence artificielle ne peut pas ressentir les émotions ou les expériences de la vie d'un humain. Elle ne peut pas se nourrir de l'imagination et de la créativité d'un artiste. C'est pourquoi je crois fermement qu'un vrai artiste ne sera jamais remplacé par les dessins d'intelligence artificielle. Les machines peuvent copier le style et la technique d'un artiste, mais elles ne pourront jamais remplacer la créativité, l'imagination et l'émotion que seul un être humain peut véritablement transmettre à travers une œuvre d'art.

After several rounds of guessing and an intense game of 20 questions, they were no closer to solving the mystery. Kakashi chuckled, shaking his head. \\"All right, I'll give you one final hint. The big secret is... it's something that many of you have never seen before.\\" The characters leaned forward, more eager than ever to unlock the secret.

Здесь вы можете использовать наиболее подходящий алгоритм в зависимости от ваших требований, такой как обход в глубину (DFS), обход в ширину (BFS) или алгоритм Дейкстры. 3. Выделите ребра, общие для всех путей: Пройдитесь по всем найденным путям и определите, есть ли общие ребра для всех путей. Если да, то это ребра являются сечением между A и B, так как удаление этих ребер приводит к разрыву всех путей между заданными вершинами. 4. Определите минимальное сечение: Минимальное сечение - это такое множество ребер, что удаление этого множества приведет к разрыву связности между вершинами A и B, и его невозможно уменьшить без потери этого свойства. Для нахождения минимального сечения вы можете попытаться удалить одно или несколько ребер из найденного сечения и проверить, остается ли граф разделенным на две части.

So, with the help of Jeremy, which is our external IT consultant, we were able to build a file containing data on which we could base our future analyses. This file was built by steps 1st step is the framing of sales which is super important, so every month I work to match our sales to the figure of the month which was submitted to ONESTREAM. (So just for information OneStream is the ENPRO financial tools) The 2nd step is to work on costs allocated and the standard margin which must also be 100% matched with one stream. This file is in YTD from January to April There were a few changes we had to make to the file so that the data would be correct. the changes that are made includes the modification of the USD rate that are in Divalto. The USD rate in Divalto isn’t correct, so we normally must adapt the rate every month with the ENPROS rate, since it changes every month too, which isn't the case in our ERP. What I can say is that the data is correct and that this file gives us a view by customer, by product, by country and even by STD margin. - So, from these data we can create different PVT table, as you can see the first PVT it represents the positive margins in global, but we can also filter it to have ag / RF view. On the second pivot, it represents negative margins, so we have splitting between AG and RF activity, we have here all the negative margin that are less than 0% in YTD I will I'll start with the negative margins linked to the TOP 20 in terms of sales. Just for information it is forbidden by French law to sell at a loss or below cost price so that’s why this work.

The group marveled at the beauty of Japan and Kakashi's knowledge of the country. They sat down at a traditional tea house where Kakashi began pouring them all some green tea. As they sipped on the tea, Sonic couldn't help but ask, \\"So, Kakashi, what made you decide to finally show us your face?\\" Kakashi thought for a moment before responding, \\"Well, I've come to realize that there are certain things that should be shared with those we care about. I consider all of you as friends, and I trust you enough to reveal my face to you.\\" The group nodded in agreement and continued drinking their tea. Suddenly, Naruto jumped up and exclaimed, \\"Hey, you know what we should do! Let's take a picture together!\\" Everyone eagerly agreed, excited to capture the moment. Kakashi set up his camera, and they all gathered together in front of the cherry blossom trees, smiling widely. They took several pictures, all of them blushing slightly with excitement and happiness. As the day came to an end and they left Japan, Kakashi looked at the photos on his camera and smiled. He had never felt more connected to his friends than he did at that moment. \\"I'm glad I decided to show you all my face,\\" he said softly. \\"We're glad you did too,\\" Lilac said with a smile.

В случае если клиент хочет вернуть товар, он должен обратиться в службу поддержки интернет-магазина, чтобы получить инструкции по возврату товара. Курьер приедет к клиенту, чтобы забрать товар и подписать документы.

Если же товары продаются хорошо, то интернет-магазин может планировать закупки, чтобы держать их в наличии и удовлетворять потребности клиентов в полном объеме.

Nàng chạy tìm nơi trú mưa và không may trượt chân té ngã vào một cái hố sâu. Thức dậy sau cú ngã, Mộ Dung Linh phát hiện ra rằng mình đã rơi vào một nơi hoàn toàn xa lạ, chứ không phải công viên ở thế giới hiện đại của cô nữa. Mọi thứ xung quanh vô cùng kỳ lạ và không giống với kiến thức của nàng từ trước tới nay. Trong lúc hoang mang và bối rối, Mộ Dung Linh không hay biết rằng cuộc sống của cô đang bị biến đổi một cách diệu kỳ và không thể ngờ tới. Sau một hồi đi lang thang trong khu rừng, Mộ Dung Linh bắt gặp đám người võ sĩ và tiên sư đang thi triển võ công và ma pháp. Cảnh tượng đó khiến cho Mộ Dung Linh không khỏi choáng váng và nhận ra mình không chỉ có ở một thế giới khác, mà còn ở một không gian và thời gian hoàn toàn mới: thế giới của tiên hiệp và pháp thuật. Chưa kịp làm quen với mọi thứ xung quanh, Mộ Dung Linh đã bị cuốn vào cuộc phiêu lưu đầy mạo hiểm và bí ẩn trong thế giới này.

This alignment is caused by physical processes such as tidal forces, angular momentum, or the alignment of galaxy spin axes during formation and evolution. Intrinsic alignment can be observed in galaxy surveys by analyzing the orientation of their shapes relative to their environment. It is important to study intrinsic alignment because it can affect cosmological measurements and make it difficult to distinguish between the effects of dark energy and other phenomena. Intrinsic alignment can also provide insight into the evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. Studying the alignment of galaxy shapes can reveal information about the formation and growth of galaxy clusters, the orientation of cosmic filaments, and the influence of dark matter on galaxy formation. However, intrinsic alignment is a complex phenomenon and is still not fully understood. Researchers continue to study and develop methods to account for its effects in cosmological measurements and simulations."},{"instruction":"Can you explain Modeling Intrinsic Galaxy Alignment in the MICE Simulation","output":"The MICE simulation (MultiDark Cosmological Simulations) is a large-scale simulation of the structure and evolution of the universe. One aspect of the simulation is the modeling of intrinsic galaxy alignment, which is the alignment of the shapes of galaxies with each other or with the larger scale structure of the universe. To model intrinsic alignment in the MICE simulation, researchers use a modification of the standard method of assigning galaxy shapes based on the anisotropy of the tidal gravitational field. In this modified method, galaxy shapes are assigned not only by the local tidal field, but also by the shear of the surrounding cosmic web. This modified method allows for more accurate modeling of intrinsic alignment, particularly on large scales, and enables researchers to study the effects of intrinsic alignment on cosmological measurements. In addition to the modified shape assignment method, the MICE simulation also incorporates other factors that contribute to intrinsic alignment, such as angular momentum and the alignment of galaxy spins during formation and evolution. Overall, modeling intrinsic galaxy alignment in the MICE simulation is an important aspect of understanding the complex interplay between galaxies and the larger structure of the universe. It allows researchers to investigate the role of intrinsic alignment in cosmological measurements, as well as gain insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies and cosmic structure."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me about how intrinsic alignment relates to weak lensing","output":"Intrinsic alignment is closely related to weak lensing, a phenomenon where gravitational lensing by large-scale structures in the universe causes the shapes of distant galaxies to be distorted. The intrinsic alignment of galaxies can cause a correlation in the observed shapes of galaxies in weak lensing surveys. This correlation, known as the intrinsic alignment contribution to weak lensing, can be mistaken for a lensing signal and can lead to inaccurate or biased measurements of the weak gravitational lensing effect. This is particularly important in cosmological studies that use weak lensing to measure the distribution of dark matter and the expansion of the universe. To account for the effects of intrinsic alignment in weak lensing surveys, researchers use statistical methods that attempt to separate the intrinsic alignment contribution from the lensing signal. Different theoretical models for intrinsic alignment, such as the tidal alignment model and the halo model, have also been developed and tested against weak lensing data. Understanding and modeling intrinsic alignment is crucial for improving cosmological measurements using weak lensing. By accurately accounting for the effects of intrinsic alignment, researchers can better measure the distribution of dark matter, constrain cosmological parameters, and gain insight into the evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe."},{"instruction":"Can you explain intrinsic alignment and tidal forces?","output":"Intrinsic alignment in galaxies refers to the alignment of their shapes with each other and with the larger scale structure of the universe. One of the physical processes that can lead to intrinsic alignment is tidal forces. Tidal forces occur when gravity from nearby objects causes a deformation in the shape of a galaxy. This deformation can cause the galaxy's internal processes to change, including the orientation of its stars and the direction of its angular momentum. Over time, tidal forces can cause neighboring galaxies to become aligned with each other, leading to intrinsic alignment on large scales. The tidal alignment model is a theoretical framework that attempts to explain the relationship between tidal forces and intrinsic galaxy alignment. The model proposes that galaxies are aligned with the tidal field caused by the large-scale structure of the universe. As galaxies grow and evolve, they become increasingly influenced by their environment, leading to the alignment of their shapes with their surroundings. Observations of galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignment have shown that the tidal alignment model is consistent with the distribution of galaxies in the universe. By studying intrinsic alignment and its relationship to tidal forces, researchers can gain insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe."},{"instruction":"What about the halo model?","output":"The halo model is another theoretical framework that attempts to explain intrinsic alignment in galaxies. In the halo model, galaxies are assumed to be located in dark matter halos, which are the largest structures in the universe that contain visible matter. According to the halo model, intrinsic alignment occurs because galaxies become aligned with the shape and orientation of their host halo. This alignment can be affected by the physical conditions and properties of the halo, such as its mass, shape, and spin. The halo model has been successful in predicting the clustering and intrinsic alignment of galaxies in simulations and observations. It is often used as a component in large-scale structure models for cosmological studies. The halo model approach also has some advantages over tidal alignment models because it can account for the full distribution of halo shapes and orientations, including out-of-phase modes that are not accounted for in the tidal alignment model. However, there are still uncertainties and challenges in modeling intrinsic alignment with the halo model. For example, the halo model assumes that all galaxies are located in dark matter halos, which may not be entirely accurate for low-mass galaxies. There may also be additional physical processes that contribute to intrinsic alignment, such as the alignment of galaxy spins during formation and evolution. Overall, the halo model provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding intrinsic alignment in galaxies, but further research is needed to accurately model and account for its effects in cosmological studies."},{"instruction":"What is the non linear alignment model of intrinsic alignment","output":"The nonlinear alignment model is a theoretical framework for modeling intrinsic galaxy alignment that takes into account the non-linear effects of gravity on the large-scale structure of the universe. Unlike the tidal alignment model and halo model, which assume that galaxies are aligned linearly with the local gravitational field, the nonlinear alignment model includes higher-order correlations in the large-scale structure. In the nonlinear alignment model, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies is related to the shape and orientation of the local matter distribution, including the locations and orientations of nearby halos. This approach takes into account the hierarchical nature of structure formation, where smaller structures form first and merge to form larger structures over time. The nonlinear alignment model has been successful in predicting the observed intrinsic alignment of galaxies on small and intermediate scales. It is particularly useful for modeling the alignment of galaxies with the cosmic web, the large-scale structure of interconnected filaments and voids in the universe. However, the nonlinear alignment model is computationally intensive and requires a large amount of data to accurately calibrate its parameters. It is also difficult to model the dependence of intrinsic alignment on galaxy properties, such as morphology, luminosity, and color, in this framework. Despite these challenges, the nonlinear alignment model provides a more accurate description of intrinsic galaxy alignment than simpler linear models, and can help improve cosmological analyses that rely on precise measurements of intrinsic alignment of galaxies."},{"instruction":"Rewrite the following commentary (on \\"In the beginning\\" of Genesis 1:1): Genesis opens with the Hebrew phrase bere’shith, typically translated as “in the beginning.” This phrase refers to the beginning of the world as we know it.

The circle character should WASD in all directions, and food circles will spawn around him. The most important condition is to add ML Agents and then explain to me how to set everything up. If anything, I have Unity and ML Agents installed and imported. I only need the code and instructions on how to make the training of the neural network start, as well as how to switch to keyboard control. The code must be complete and working.","output":"I cannot directly create a Unity project for you here, but I can provide you with detailed instructions on how to create a simple 2D top-down game with ML Agents in Unity. Prerequisites: 1. Make sure you have Unity installed (preferably the latest version). 2. Make sure you have the ML Agents package installed and imported into your project. You can find the package in Unity Package Manager or download it from the official GitHub repository: [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) Step 1: Create a new Unity 2D project 1. Open Unity Hub and create a new 2D project. Step 2: Set up the environment and game objects 1. In the Hierarchy, right-click and create an empty GameObject. Name it \\"Environment\\". 2. Right-click \\"Environment\\" and create a new square 2D sprite. Name it \\"Player\\" and set its scale to (0.5, 0.5, 1). This sprite will represent the circle character. 3. Right-click \\"Environment\\" again and create a new square 2D sprite. Name it \\"Food\\" and set its scale to (0.3, 0.3, 1). This sprite will represent the food circles. Step 3: Add components to Player and Food 1. Select the \\"Player\\" object in the Hierarchy, then click the \\"Add Component\\" button on the Inspector. Add a \\"Circle Collider 2D\\" component. 2. Click the \\"Add Component\\" button again and select \\"New Script\\". Name it \\"PlayerController\\" and click \\"Create and Add\\". 3. Select \\"Food\\" in the Hierarchy, and click \\"Add Component\\". Search for \\"Circle Collider 2D\\" and set that up as well. Step 4: Create an Academy and Agent 1. Right-click the Hierarchy and create an empty GameObject. Name it \\"CircleAgentAcademy\\". 2. Click \\"Add Component\\" and select \\"New Script\\". Name it \\"CircleAgentAcademy\\" and click \\"Create and Add\\". 3. In the \\"CircleAgentAcademy\\" script, you need to inherit from \\"Unity.MLAgents.Academy\\" instead of \\"MonoBehaviour\\". Then, you don't need to define any further properties or methods for now. \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; using Unity.MLAgents; public class CircleAgentAcademy : Academy { } \`\`\` 4. Select the \\"Player\\" object in the Hierarchy and click \\"Add Component\\". Search for \\"Agent\\" and add the \\"Agent\\" component to the Player object. 5. Click \\"Add Component\\" again and select \\"New Script\\". Name it \\"CircleAgent\\" and click \\"Create and Add\\". 6. In the \\"CircleAgent\\" script, you need to inherit from \\"Unity.MLAgents.Agent\\" instead of \\"MonoBehaviour\\". Implement the required methods and properties for controlling the character's movements, collecting rewards, and resetting the environment. Step 5: Train the Agent 1. Follow the official [ML-Agents Documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) to set up the Python environment required to train the agent. 2. Look into ML-Agents documentation's [Basic Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Basic-Guide.md) to learn how to train your agent using the provided training configurations. After you have a trained model, you can use it with your Unity project and switch to keyboard controls as needed. Here's an example PlayerController script that would allow keyboard control with WASD anytime you don't have a neural network loaded: \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour { public float moveSpeed = 5.0f; void Update() { float horizontal = Input.GetAxis(\\"Horizontal\\"); float vertical = Input.GetAxis(\\"Vertical\\"); transform.position += new Vector3(horizontal * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime, vertical * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0); } } \`\`\` In your Academy script, you can use the \`Academy.Instance.IsCommunicatorOn\` property to check if a neural network is being used. If the agent isn't communicating with the Python process, then you can enable the PlayerController script: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using Unity.MLAgents; public class CircleAgentAcademy : Academy { public GameObject player; void Start() { if (!IsCommunicatorOn) { player.GetComponent<PlayerController>().enabled = true; } } } \`\`\` Remember to assign the \\"Player\\" object to the \\"player\\" property of the \\"CircleAgentAcademy\\" script in the Unity Inspector. And that's it! You should now be able to train your agent using ML-Agents and switch to keyboard control when a neural network is not being used."},{"instruction":"Rewrite the following commentary (on \\"In the beginning\\" of Genesis 1:1): Genesis opens with the Hebrew phrase bere’shith, typically translated as “in the beginning.” This phrase refers to the beginning of the world as we know it.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Would you please give me the MEL commands to create that movie The movie begins with a character named Jack walking by the edge of a cliff, gazing at the beautiful sunset. Suddenly, he notices a group of people stranded on a small island offshore, surrounded by rough waters. Jack immediately understands that they need help and decides to save them. As he sets out on his journey to rescue them, he encounters various obstacles in the form of strong winds, rough waters, and imminent collision with sharp rocks. He uses his knowledge of Maya commands and MEL procedures to navigate his way through the obstacles, using particle animations to generate a realistic depiction of water and collision animations to show the impact of waves and rocks. Upon reaching the stranded group of people, Jack uses inverse kinematics to save them from the dangerous situation, by creating motion paths for their movement and generating character animations to show their emotions of fear, relief, and gratitude. Along the way, Jack also conquers his own fears and struggles, represented by the obstacles he faces, ultimately learning the value of courage, perseverance, and selflessness. The movie ends with Jack and the stranded group returning to the shore, safe and sound, accompanied by a visually stunning representation of clouds and fire in the background","output":"Creating a movie in Maya involves a variety of MEL commands and procedures, and can be a complex process. Here are some commands that could potentially be used to create the scenes and effects described in your movie: 1. To create the character named Jack, you may use modeling commands such as polyCube and sculpting tools to create a 3D model of the character. 2. To animate Jack walking by the edge of the cliff, you could use the animation commands such as keyframe, path animation, and motion capture techniques. 3. To create the particle animations for the realistic depiction of water, you could use the particle dynamics commands such as particle emitter, fluid simulations, and particle collisions. 4. To generate the collision animations for waves and rocks, you may use the rigid body dynamics commands such as dynamics solver, collision objects, and constraints. 5. To create the motion paths and character animations for the stranded group, you could use the inverse kinematics commands such as joint rotations, motion paths, and keyframe animations. 6. To create the visual effects for clouds and fire in the background, you could use Maya's built-in visual effects tools such as smoke, fire simulation, and volumetric rendering. These are just a few examples of the many commands, tools, and procedures that can be used to create a movie in Maya.

When the prince objects that they are both men, he replies that the court sorcerer has already brewed the sex-changing potion (So that the Prince can permanently become a woman).","output":"In the kingdom of Elyria, the sun's rays stretched lazily across the expanse, casting long shadows over the cobbled streets and verdant gardens. It was on such a day that the inevitable occurred - a parliament assembled to address the barbarian threat plaguing the neighboring lands. Rumors swirled of the fierce and relentless Invik, their unwashed hordes descending upon unsuspecting towns like a tidal wave of destruction. Their roars tore through the night, accompanied by the thundering cacophony of drums that haunted even the sweet dreams of children. Alas, King Aloysius had the visage of a weary man, caught between the hammer of the Invik and the anvil of his people's cries for protection. No longer could he dismiss the encroaching threat as a distant nightmare. With a heavy heart, he gestured for silence, his regal voice cutting through the heated discussions like a sharpened blade. \\"Gentle lords and noble ladies,\\" King Aloysius began solemnly, \\"it is my duty to address the carnivorous beast at our gate. God has deemed it fit to bless us with a solution, both foul and ingenious, to the abomination swooping down upon us.\\" His wary eyes sought out Prince Elric, whose milky blue gaze mirrored the confusion rife across the chamber. Prince Elric, strong and willful, braced himself for what was to come. \\"The Invik chieftain, named Ragnar by his own infernal tongue, has consented to peace on one condition: he shall take a bride from our hallowed ranks, and in turn, his barbarians will spare us their wretched scourge. My son, it is your duty to marry this barbarian chieftain and thus preserve our sovereignty.\\" A collective gasp filled the room, drowning out the prince's spluttering protests. His wide eyes were clouded with indignation, trepidation, and above all else, defiance. \\"But father, have you lost all reason?\\" retorted Prince Elric. \\"He is a man, as I am! What unholy matrimony do you propose we forge? Are we to be bound to each other for life, bound to create life as is customary?\\" It was then that King Aloysius hesitated, revealing an ornate vial his trembling hand had been concealing. It contained a liquid of ethereal hues, dancing like the aurora borealis in its confinement. The onlookers regarded the vial with cautious curiosity. \\"It is the devil's concoction, brewed at the behest of our Court Sorcerer, Zacharias. One sip of this elixir and you, my son, shall be able to bear Ragnar's progeny,\\" King Aloysius whispered, watching a thousand questions prance into the forbidden fields of Prince Elric's mind. \\"In this manner, peace will be secured, and Elyria will be spared the wrath of ungodly hordes.\\" Ashen-faced and bitter, Prince Elric mulled the prospect of embracing the womanly traits that were so alien to him. His father's proposal posed an impossible gamble: to cling to a sinking ship or swim into the unknown depths of the ocean. His instinct urged him to revolt, to choose Elyria's demise over mindless submission. Yet noble blood coursed through his veins, and with it, a responsibility he could scarce comprehend. Victorious whispers seeped from the shadows, and the prince was left with no choice but to trade his breeches for a swaddling gown fit for a princess. He beheld the vial's shimmer with both craving and revulsion, each as potent as the other. In a deliberate motion, Prince Elric uncorked the vial, inhaled its sweet fragrance, and tipped it back like a bubbling chalice. Soon the soft wails of a newborn life would join hands with the orchestral dance of life and change in Elyria. And thus, Queen Elira was born."},{"instruction":"Write a sequel about her life with Ragnar","output":"The sun had set, bleeding the skies with the fiery hues of gold and crimson, as the kingdom of Elyria bustled with excitement for an event unlike any it had seen before. The wedding bells rang merrily, announcing the unprecedented union of Queen Elira – once the valiant Prince Elric – and the fearsome barbarian Chieftain Ragnar. Transformed by the sorcerer's elixir, Elira now embodied a mysterious beauty, her ethereal eyes and fair complexion a stark contrast to Ragnar's grizzled visage. The barbarian leader appeared uneasy in his refined ceremonial garb, standing on the palace ground as if he had wandered into a surreal dream. As the couple exchanged their sacred vows, a fragile truce settled over Elyria and the Invik clans. It was a hesitant accord, born of necessity and sacrifice, forged at the edge of a precipice where two worlds collided. The folk of Elyria spent their days sowing the seeds of diplomacy, teaching their language, customs, and arts to the once vengeful newcomers. In turn, the Inviks regaled their hosts with tales of conquering, overcoming trials at the hands of treacherous terrain and powerful adversaries. One such bond flourished between Elira and Ragnar. Despite their vastly different origins, the empathetic queen and proud chieftain discovered an unforeseen kinship, cultivating a mutual respect and understanding that transcended the limitations of their union. Together, they ventured on clandestine hunting trips, and Elira found an unharmonious solace in the fierce spirit of the Invik. Through her eyes, Ragnar saw the importance of nourishing the heart and soul while preserving an orthodox order. He introduced her to the unfettered exhilaration of the wild, allowing her to reclaim a piece of the warrior spirit she once possessed. Months turned to years, and Elyria embraced the slow but irrevocable fusion of cultures. As the initial shock dissipated, the intermingling of customs and ideas enriched the kingdom, architecting a vibrant civilization that allied the earth's untamed spirit with the vibrant sky above. And in the shadow of this budding harmony, Elira and Ragnar welcomed a child into the realm. A son, bred from the immaterial quintessence of the magical transformation in conjunction with the unyielding spirit of the north. He was the living testament to their love and the evolving world around them, a priceless reflection of a bittersweet sacrifice that would be etched into the annals of history.

In Freedom Planet, we see the main characters – Lilac, Carol, and Milla – grow as individuals and as a team. Lilac, who initially distrusts outsiders and prefers to work alone, learns to trust and rely on her friends. Carol, who is impulsive and hot-headed, becomes more thoughtful and strategic. Milla, who at first struggles to find her place on the team, becomes more confident in her abilities and her role in the group. Similarly, in Naruto, we see growth and development in all of the main characters, especially in the titular character himself. Naruto, who starts off as an immature and brash young ninja with a need for attention and validation, gradually learns to be more patient, compassionate, and selfless. He becomes a leader and a role model for his peers, and his personal growth inspires those around him to strive to be better. In both of these stories, growth and development are not limited to the main characters. Supporting characters like Tails in Freedom Planet and Sasuke in Naruto also experience their own journeys of growth and change. This emphasis on character development and growth not only adds depth to the storytelling but also creates a more engaging and immersive experience for the audience."},{"instruction":"freedom planet and naruto: Growth of Characters part 2","output":"In addition to the main and supporting characters, Freedom Planet and Naruto both explore the growth of their antagonists. In Freedom Planet, the primary villain Lord Brevon initially appears as a one-dimensional villain bent on world domination. However, as the story unfolds, we learn more about Brevon's tragic past and motivations for his actions. This helps to add depth to his character and makes him a more complex and intriguing antagonist. Similarly, in Naruto, many of the villains have their own stories of pain and trauma that drive their actions. This includes characters like Gaara, Itachi, and Pain, whose stories of growth and redemption are just as compelling as those of the main characters. Additionally, both Freedom Planet and Naruto explore themes of forgiveness and redemption. In Freedom Planet, this is exemplified by the character Spade, who initially serves as a thorn in the side of the protagonists but later has a change of heart and becomes an ally. In Naruto, the concept of forgiveness is central to the story, particularly in the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke. Overall, the growth and development of all characters, including the antagonists, is a key aspect of both Freedom Planet and Naruto.

Douglas Journal: Applied Cognitive Psychology Volume: 34, Issue: 2, Pages: 219-233 Publication Year: 2020 DOI: 10.1002/ail2.53 Abstract: Research on the psychology of conspiracy theories has so far focused on understanding why people create them and on identifying those who endorse them most strongly. This paper argues that naïve attribution processes play a key role in the construction of complex conspiracy theories that yield alternative explanations for significant events. One of the primary triggers is the effort to explain events that do not fit with our expectations, and when such events are significant, they often produce a desire to develop a complex account. This account is often constructed in collaboration with others via iterative naïve attribution processes, which yield the complexity and specificity of conspiracy theories. This article reviews research evidence supporting the role of naïve attribution processes in the construction of conspiracy theories, and presents a new model that accounts for the cognitive, motivational and social factors involved. This model, based on Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory, also provides important insights into the cognitive, social and psychological processes that contribute to the maintenance of conspiracy theories and the reluctance to abandon them, in the face of contradictory evidence.

I only need the code and instructions on how to make the training of the neural network start, as well as how to switch to keyboard control. The code must be complete and working.","output":"To create a simple Unity game with ML Agents, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Create a new Unity project and import ML-Agents 1. Create a new 2D Unity project. 2. Import the latest version of ML-Agents Unity package from the downloaded ML-Agents repository. To do this, go to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package and select the \\"com.unity.ml-agents[version].unitypackage\\" from the downloaded repository folder (located in the com.unity.ml-agents folder). Step 2: Create the game scene 1. In the Hierarchy window, right-click and create a new Empty GameObject, then rename it to \\"GameEnvironment\\". 2. In the GameObject menu, create a new 2D Object > Circle, then rename it to \\"Agent\\". 3. In the GameObject menu, create another 2D Object > Circle, then rename it to \\"Food\\". Step 3: Set up food spawner 1. Click on \\"GameEnvironment\\" and add a new script component named \\"FoodSpawner\\". 2. Replace the existing \`Start\` and \`Update\` methods with: \`\`\`csharp public GameObject foodPrefab; public int numberOfFoods; private List<GameObject> foods; void Start() { foods = new List<GameObject>(); for (int i = 0; i < numberOfFoods; i++) { GameObject food = Instantiate(foodPrefab, new Vector2(Random.Range(-8f, 8f), Random.Range(-4.5f, 4.5f)), Quaternion.identity); food.transform.SetParent(transform); foods.Add(food); } } \`\`\` 3. In the Unity Editor, assign the \\"Food\\" Circle object to the foodPrefab variable and set numberOfFoods to your desired number. Step 4: Set up the agent 1. Click on \\"Agent\\" and add a new script component named \\"CircleAgent\\". 2. Add these namespaces at the top: \`\`\`csharp using MLAgents; using MLAgents.Sensors; using UnityEngine; \`\`\` 3. Make the CircleAgent inherit from Agent with \`public class CircleAgent : Agent\`. 4. Write the following code inside the CircleAgent class: \`\`\`csharp public GameObject foodPrefab; public float moveSpeed; private Rigidbody2D rb; public override void Initialize() { rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>(); } public override void OnEpisodeBegin() { transform.localPosition = new Vector2(Random.Range(-8f, 8f), Random.Range(-4.5f, 4.5f)); GameObject.FindWithTag(\\"Food\\").transform.localPosition = new Vector2(Random.Range(-8f, 8f), Random.Range(-4.5f, 4.5f)); } public override void CollectObservations(VectorSensor sensor) { sensor.AddObservation(transform.localPosition); sensor.AddObservation(GameObject.FindWithTag(\\"Food\\").transform.localPosition); } public override void OnActionReceived(float[] vectorAction) { Vector2 direction = new Vector2(vectorAction[0], vectorAction[1]); rb.velocity = direction.normalized * moveSpeed; } public override void Heuristic(float[] actionsOut) { actionsOut[0] = Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W) ? 1 : (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S) ? -1 : 0); actionsOut[1] = Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D) ? 1 : (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A) ? -1 : 0); } private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision) { if (collision.CompareTag(\\"Food\\")) { SetReward(1.0f); EndEpisode(); } } \`\`\` 5. Attach the CircleAgent script to the \\"Agent\\" game object and assign the \\"Food\\" Circle object to the foodPrefab variable. Step 5: Set up the ML-Agents environment 1. Create a new folder named \\"Training\\" in the Assets folder. 2. Create a YAML configuration file in this folder named 'CircleAgentTraining.yaml'. 3. Write the following lines in the YAML file: \`\`\`yaml behaviors: CircleAgent: trainer_type: ppo max_steps: 1000000 time_horizon: 40 summary_freq: 4000 beta: 0.01 hidden_units: 32 learning_rate: 0.0003 num_layers: 2 num_epoch: 3 batch_size: 1024 buffer_size: 10240 epsilon: 0.2 \`\`\` Step 6: Training the agent 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the 'ml-agents-release_N' (where N is the version) folder you downloaded. 2. Run the following command: \`\`\` mlagents-learn Path/To/CircleAgentTraining.yaml --run-id CircleAgentTraining --train \`\`\` Replace \\"Path/To\\" with the full path to the CircleAgentTraining.yaml file. 3. Wait for the training to complete. Step 7: Use the trained model 1. In the Unity Editor, create a new GameObject called \\"Behavior Parameters\\". 2. Attach the \\"Behavior Parameters\\" script to it. 3. Drag and drop the trained .nn file (inside the /models folder) into the \\"Model\\" field of the Behavior Parameters script. 4. That's it! The agent will now use the trained neural network to move. Note that if you want to switch to keyboard control, simply disable the \\"Behavior Parameters\\" component or entire game object in the Unity Editor. I hope these instructions help you create a simple Unity game with ML-Agents!"},{"instruction":"You are using an old version of ML Agents.
