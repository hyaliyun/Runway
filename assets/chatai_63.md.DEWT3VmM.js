(b) all 8 boxes are sent to the same address? © 4 of the boxes are shipped to four different addresses while 4 are left to be addressed later?","output":"To determine the number of ways to pack these books, we can apply combinatorics principles, considering the three scenarios separately. # (a) All 8 Boxes Are Sent to Different Addresses Firstly, we need to place the 24 distinct books into the 8 boxes, each box containing 3 books. 1. The number of ways to choose 3 books out of 24 for the first box is ( binom{24}{3} ). 2. For the next box, we then choose 3 out of the remaining 21, which is ( binom{21}{3} ), and so on until all the books are placed. So, the total number of ways to place the books into the boxes, without considering the addresses, is given by the multinomial coefficient: [ frac{24!}{3! cdot 3! cdot 3! cdot 3! cdot 3! cdot 3! cdot 3! cdot 3!} ] However, since each box is sent to different addresses, we also need to account for the permutations of these boxes. There are (8!) ways to order the 8 boxes. Hence, the total number of ways is: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} times 8! ] # (b) All 8 Boxes Are Sent to the Same Address If all boxes go to the same address, we only need to count the ways to distribute the books among the boxes, without considering box order, as it does not matter. Therefore, the calculation simplifies to just the arrangement of books: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] # © 4 of the Boxes Are Shipped to Four Different Addresses While 4 Are Left to Be Addressed Later For this case, the addressing of 4 boxes matters but not for the other 4. The calculation for distributing the books is the same as in (b) since initially we are just concerned with how to pack the books, not how they are addressed. Thus, we start with: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] Then, we account for the addressing of 4 of these boxes. Since 4 boxes go to distinct addresses, there are (4!) ways to arrange these, considering the addressing matters only for these 4. The remaining 4 boxes' addressing doesn’t matter (like part (b)), so we don’t multiply by another (4!) for those. Thus, the total number for this scenario is: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} times 4! ] # Calculation Details Let's calculate the specifics: 1. ( frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ) = ( frac{24!}{6^{8}} ) 2. ( 8! ) = 40,320 for part (a) 3. ( 4! ) = 24 for part (c) Thus, we have laid out the methods for calculating each scenario, but actual numerical calculation would require a calculator or computational tool due to the large factorials involved. Factoring in (8!) or (4!) adjusts for the different scenarios as indicated."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

The creation of Ivory Soap dates back to 1879 and is attributed to James N. Gamble, son of Procter & Gamble's co-founder, James Gamble. According to company lore, the invention occurred when a P&G employee forgot to turn off a mixing machine when he went to lunch. This mistake led to the incorporation of more air into the soap mixture. When this batch of soap was used, it was discovered that the bars floated in water, unlike other soaps of the time. P&G recognized the unique characteristic of this soap and capitalized on it, marketing Ivory as \\"The Soap That Floats.\\" This feature, along with its purity (it was advertised as being 99 44/100% pure), helped Ivory Soap become a significant product for Procter & Gamble. The accidental invention became a successful product that has been marketed for over a century with the floating characteristic and purity as its main selling points."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Es ampliamente utilizado en suplementos nutricionales y productos alimenticios como agente estabilizante y para mejorar el contenido proteico. En términos de contenido proteico, el caseinato de calcio típicamente contiene alrededor de 90-95% de proteína en peso seco. Esto significa que por cada 100 gramos de caseinato de calcio, hay aproximadamente 90 a 95 gramos de proteína. Sin embargo, este valor puede variar ligeramente dependiendo del fabricante y del proceso específico de fabricación. Es importante tener en cuenta que el caseinato de calcio es una proteína de digestión lenta, lo que significa que se digiere y se absorbe gradualmente en el sistema. Esto lo hace especialmente útil para el consumo antes de dormir o en momentos en los cuales habrá un largo período sin comida, ya que ayuda a mantener una liberación sostenida de aminoácidos en el torrente sanguíneo, potencialmente contribuyendo a la reparación y al crecimiento muscular. Siempre es recomendable consultar con un profesional de la salud o un nutricionista antes de incorporar cualquier suplemento en tu dieta, especialmente si tienes condiciones de salud específicas o necesidades dietéticas particulares."},{"instruction":"como se consume dia a dia","output":"El consumo diario de caseinato de calcio puede variar dependiendo de tus objetivos nutricionales, necesidades calóricas y cualquier recomendación específica de un profesional de la salud o nutricionista. Aquí te doy algunas orientaciones generales sobre cómo podría incorporarse el caseinato de calcio en la dieta diaria: **1. Como suplemento proteico:** El caseinato de calcio se puede tomar como un suplemento proteico, mezclando el polvo con agua, leche o cualquier otro líquido de tu elección. Esto es especialmente útil para aquellos que necesitan aumentar su ingesta de proteínas debido a un nivel elevado de actividad física o para apoyar la recuperación y el crecimiento muscular. **2. Antes de dormir:** Dado que el caseinato de calcio es una proteína de digestión lenta, consumirlo antes de dormir puede proporcionar una fuente sostenida de aminoácidos a tus músculos durante la noche, lo cual es útil para la recuperación y el crecimiento muscular. **3. Como parte de batidos o smoothies:** Puedes incorporar el caseinato de calcio en batidos o smoothies para aumentar su contenido proteico. Mezcla el polvo con frutas, verduras, leche o sustitutos de la leche, y otros ingredientes nutritivos para un refrigerio equilibrado o una comida sustituta. **4. En recetas de cocina:** El caseinato de calcio puede ser utilizado como ingrediente en diversas recetas, como panqueques proteicos, barras de proteínas caseras, y otros productos de repostería, para aumentar su contenido proteico. **Dosis recomendada:** La cantidad exacta a consumir depende de varios factores como tu peso corporal, nivel de actividad física, objetivos de entrenamiento, y necesidades dietéticas generales. Como regla general, la ingesta diaria de proteína para una persona promedio es de aproximadamente 0.8 gramos por kilo de peso corporal, pero esta cantidad puede aumentar para quienes buscan ganar masa muscular o están muy activos físicamente, llegando hasta 1.2-2.0 gramos por kilo de peso corporal. Es importante empezar con una dosis menor y ajustar según cómo tu cuerpo responda, y siempre es recomendable obtener la mayor parte de tu proteína de fuentes alimenticias completas, utilizando el caseinato de calcio y otros suplementos solo como complementos a una dieta balanceada y saludable. **Consultar con un profesional:** Antes de incorporar el caseinato de calcio o cualquier otro suplemento a tu dieta, es importante consultar con un profesional de la salud o un nutricionista para recibir asesoramiento personalizado basado en tus necesidades específicas."},{"instruction":"mido 1.66mts y peso 54kg como lo debo tomar","output":"Con tus medidas, 1.66 metros de altura y 54 kilogramos de peso, el cálculo de tu ingesta proteica diaria dependerá de tu nivel de actividad, objetivos de fitness, edad y estado de salud general. Para una persona promedio que no realiza mucho ejercicio, la ingesta recomendada de proteínas es de 0.8 gramos por kilogramo de peso corporal al día. Esto significa que tu ingesta mínima sería de alrededor de 43.2 gramos de proteínas al día (54 kg x 0.8 g/kg). Sin embargo, si eres físicamente activo, estás intentando aumentar masa muscular, o te estás recuperando de una lesión, tus necesidades de proteínas pueden aumentar a 1.2-2.0 gramos por kilogramo de peso corporal al día. Para una actividad moderada a intensa, una buena regla general podría ser consumir aproximadamente 1.2 a 1.5 gramos de proteínas por kilogramo de peso corporal, lo que significa que requerirías entre 65 y 81 gramos de proteínas al día. Aquí te dejo una guía sobre cómo podrías incorporar el caseinato de calcio en tu dieta: # 1. Determina tu necesidad diaria de proteínas: Suponiendo que te ejercitas regularmente con el objetivo de mantenimiento o leve aumento de masa muscular, puedes apuntar a una ingesta de proteínas de alrededor de 1.2 a 1.5 gramos por kilogramo de peso corporal por día. Esto te sitúa en una necesidad diaria aproximada de entre 65 y 81 gramos de proteínas. # 2. Considera tu ingesta actual de proteínas: Evalúa cuántas proteínas estás consumiendo actualmente a través de tu dieta. Incluye todas las fuentes de proteínas como carnes, pescados, legumbres, nueces, semillas y productos lácteos. # 3. Cómo incorporar el caseinato de calcio: Si tu dieta actual no cumple con tu requerimiento de proteínas, puedes usar el caseinato de calcio como un suplemento para ayudarte a alcanzar tu objetivo. - **Antes de dormir:** Considera tomar caseinato de calcio antes de dormir para apoyar la reparación y el crecimiento muscular durante la noche, debido a su digestión lenta. Una porción típica proporciona alrededor de 20 a 25 gramos de proteínas. - **Entre comidas:** También puedes tomarlo entre comidas como un bocadillo proteico para ayudar a mantener tus niveles de aminoácidos estables a lo largo del día. # 4. Preparación: El caseinato de calcio se puede mezclar con agua, leche o incluir en batidos. Una dosis común es una medida (la cantidad específica varía según la marca, pero suele ser alrededor de 20-30 gramos de polvo) mezclada en 200-300 ml de líquido. Recuerda, la clave es usar el caseinato de calcio como un suplemento a una dieta ya rica en nutrientes, no como un sustituto de alimentos reales ricos en proteínas. Y como siempre, es beneficioso consultar con un nutricionista o un médico antes de hacer cambios significativos en tu régimen dietético o suplementario, especialmente para asegurar que el plan escogido se alinea con tus necesidades y objetivos específicos de salud y fitness."},{"instruction":"me tomo 100cc de leche al dia, 140gr de cerdo, 100gr de ternera, 30gr de mani, cuantos gramos de proteina son al dia?","output":"Para calcular tu ingesta diaria de proteínas basada en los alimentos que mencionas, vamos a desglosar el contenido proteico aproximado de cada uno. Es importante recordar que estas cantidades son estimaciones generales y pueden variar según la fuente específica de cada alimento y su preparación. 1. **Leche**: Dependiendo del tipo (entera, descremada, semi-descremada), la leche contiene alrededor de 3.2 a 3.4 gramos de proteína por cada 100 ml. Suponiendo que tomas leche entera, 100 ml (o cc, ya que para fines prácticos 1 ml de agua = 1 cc) te proporcionarían unos 3.4 gramos de proteína. 2. **Cerdo**: La carne de cerdo puede variar en contenido proteico según la corte y su preparación, pero una estimación promedio es de aproximadamente 25-30 gramos de proteína por cada 100 gramos de carne cocida. Si consumes 140 gramos, usando un promedio de 27.5 gramos de proteína por cada 100 gramos, obtendrías aproximadamente 38.5 gramos de proteína. 3. **Ternera (Vacuno)**: Similar al cerdo, la ternera tiene un alto contenido de proteína, oscilando alrededor de 20-30 gramos de proteína por cada 100 gramos dependiendo del corte y de cómo se cocine. Tomando un promedio de 25 gramos de proteína por cada 100 gramos, 100 gramos de ternera te aportarían entonces 25 gramos de proteína. 4. **Maní**: El maní contiene aproximadamente 25-28 gramos de proteína por cada 100 gramos. Por lo tanto, 30 gramos de maní te proporcionarían alrededor de 7.5 a 8.4 gramos de proteína (usando un promedio de 26 gramos de proteína por cada 100 gramos). Sumando estas cantidades obtenemos: - Leche: 3.4 gramos - Cerdo: 38.5 gramos - Ternera: 25 gramos - Maní: 7.5 a 8.4 gramos **Total diario aproximado:** 74.4 a 75.3 gramos de proteína. Estas cifras son aproximaciones y pueden variar. La calidad de la carne (por ejemplo, si es magra o tiene más grasa), cómo se prepara (cocida, a la parrilla, etc.), y la variedad específica de maní o tipo de leche pueden influir en el contenido final de proteína. Además, es bueno tener en cuenta la biodisponibilidad y la variedad de tu ingesta diaria de aminoácidos, que también son importantes para una dieta equilibrada."},{"instruction":"esa cantidad de proteina es la adecuada para mi peso?","output":"Dada tu altura de 1.66 metros y tu peso de 54 kilogramos, podemos calcular si la cantidad de proteína que consumes diariamente es adecuada para ti. Como he mencionado anteriormente, las recomendaciones generales de ingesta de proteína varían dependiendo de tu nivel de actividad física, objetivos, edad, y estado de salud. Para una persona con un estilo de vida sedentario, la recomendación es de 0.8 gramos de proteína por kilogramo de peso corporal al día. Sin embargo, esta cantidad aumenta si eres físicamente activo(a), especialmente si realizas ejercicios de fuerza o resistencia con el objetivo de ganar músculo, mantenerte, o mejorar tu rendimiento deportivo. **Calculando tus necesidades básicas:** - **Estilo de vida sedentario:** 54 kg x 0.8 g/kg = 43.2 g de proteína al día. - **Actividad moderada (ejercicio moderado o intenso varias veces a la semana):** 54 kg x 1.2-1.6 g/kg = 64.8 - 86.4 g de proteína al día. - **Entrenamiento intenso (atletas, personas que hacen entrenamiento de fuerza intensa):** 54 kg x 1.6-2.0 g/kg = 86.4 - 108 g de proteína al día. Dado que estás consumiendo aproximadamente entre 74.4 y 75.3 gramos de proteína al día, esta cifra se ajusta bien a las necesidades de alguien con un nivel de actividad física moderada. Si tu estilo de vida es más sedentario, estarías consumiendo más proteína de la que necesitas, lo cual generalmente no es motivo de preocupación, siempre que mantengas una dieta equilibrada en general y no tengas ninguna condición médica que requiera limitar tu ingesta de proteínas. Por otro lado, si estás muy activo o intentas aumentar masa muscular, tu consumo actual de proteínas se sitúa en el rango bajo pero adecuado, y podrías considerar incrementarlo ligeramente para optimizar la recuperación y el crecimiento muscular, asegurándote siempre de complementar esto con una ingesta calórica y de nutrientes adecuada para tus niveles de actividad. Es recomendable que ajustes tu ingesta de proteínas de acuerdo a tus sensaciones, progreso en el entrenamiento, y objetivos. Y, como siempre, considera consultar con un nutricionista o médico deportivo para obtener recomendaciones personalizadas basadas en tus necesidades y condiciones específicas."},{"instruction":"si a esto le sumo 30gr de caseinato de calcio?","output":"Si agregas 30 gramos de caseinato de calcio a tu dieta actual, incrementarías tu ingesta diaria de proteínas basándonos en la cantidad típica de proteínas que proporciona este suplemento. El caseinato de calcio generalmente contiene alrededor de 90-95% de proteína por peso. Esto significa que, en 30 gramos de caseinato de calcio, obtendrías aproximadamente 27 a 28.5 gramos de proteína adicional. Si antes estabas consumiendo entre 74.4 y 75.3 gramos de proteína al día, al sumarle los 27 a 28.5 gramos de proteína del caseinato de calcio, tu ingesta total de proteínas aumentaría a: - **Sin caseinato de calcio:** 74.4 - 75.3 gramos - **Con caseinato de calcio:** 101.4 - 103.8 gramos (aproximadamente) Esta nueva cantidad se ajustaría incluso a las necesidades proteicas de alguien con un alto nivel de actividad física o que está intentando ganar masa muscular. Para tu peso de 54 kg, este nivel de ingesta de proteínas se encuentra dentro del rango recomendado para personas que realizan entrenamientos intensos regularmente o para aquellas en periodos de recuperación muscular intensa, ya que equivale aproximadamente a **1.9 a 1.92 g/kg/día**. Sin embargo, es importante recordar que, aunque el aumento en la ingesta de proteínas puede ser beneficioso hasta cierto punto, también es crucial mantener una dieta equilibrada que incluya una adecuada proporción de carbohidratos, grasas saludables, vitaminas y minerales. El exceso de proteína, particularmente si se consume al margen de una dieta equilibrada, puede poner presión innecesaria en los riñones y podría no ofrecer beneficios adicionales en términos de crecimiento o reparación muscular. Por lo tanto, si decides incrementar tu ingesta de proteínas con caseinato de calcio o cualquier otro suplemento, asegúrate de ajustar el resto de tu dieta en consecuencia y considera tu nivel de actividad física, metas personales y cualquier consejo de un profesional de la salud o un nutricionista deportivo."},{"instruction":"consumo 2 panes al dia, cocoa con azucar, arroz, ensalada, aguacate, papa, y una porcion de frutas mas lo anterior, eso es balanceado?","output":"Basado en la descripción de tu dieta diaria que incluye 2 panes, cacao con azúcar, arroz, ensalada, aguacate, papa y una porción de frutas, más el consumo previamente mencionado de proteínas de origen animal y caseinato de calcio, parece que estás incorporando una variedad de grupos de alimentos importantes.

let greeting = format!(\\"Hello, {}!\\", name); println!(\\"{}\\", greeting); \`\`\` 2. **使用\`println!\`或\`print!\`宏直接输出**: 如果你只是想将变量值插入字符串并直接打印而不需要存储结果，可以直接使用\`println!\`或\`print!\`宏。 \`\`\`rust let temp = 22; println!(\\"The temperature is {}C\\", temp); \`\`\` 3. **字符串拼接**: 对于简单的场景，可以通过\`+\`运算符或字符串切片\`.to_owned()\`与\`+\`的组合来拼接字符串。这种方法适用于拼接少量的字符串，但不推荐用于复杂的字符串拼接操作，因为它的性能较差并且用法不够灵活。 使用\`+\`： \`\`\`rust let name = \\"world\\"; let greeting = \\"Hello, \\".to_string() + name + \\"!\\"; println!(\\"{}\\", greeting); \`\`\` 使用\`.to_owned()\`： \`\`\`rust let name = \\"world\\"; let greeting = \\"Hello, \\".to_owned() + name + \\"!\\"; println!(\\"{}\\", greeting); \`\`\` 4. **占位符和索引**: 使用\`format!\`宏时，可以通过索引控制参数的输出顺序，或者重复使用某些参数。 \`\`\`rust let year = 2023; let month = \\"March\\"; let day = 15; let date = format!(\\"{2}-{1}-{0}\\", year, month, day);

use std::env; #[tokio::main] async fn main() -> Result<(), sqlx::Error> { // 假设你的DATABASE_URL环境变量已经设置，例如： // DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname let database_url = env::var(\\"DATABASE_URL\\").expect(\\"DATABASE_URL is not set in .env file\\"); let pool = PgPoolOptions::new() .connect(&database_url) .await?; // 假设我们查询的表名是users，字段名是email let result = sqlx::query!( \\"SELECT email FROM users WHERE id = 1\\", 1 // 假设我们要查询id为1的用户 ) .fetch_one(&pool) .await?; // 直接通过字段名访问查询结果 println!(\\"The email of the user is: {}\\", result.email); Ok(()) } \`\`\` 几点注意事项： 1. **查询字符串**：\`query!\`宏要求你提供一个静态的SQL查询字符串，并且参数使用\`N\`语法来代替。 2. **查询参数**：在SQL查询字符串后面，你可以按照顺序列出所有需要的参数。 3. **访问结果**：在\`query!\`执行后，你可以通过\`.await\`来等待查询结果。结果变量（在这个例子中是\`result\`）会是一个结构体，你可以通过字段名（如\`result.email\`）来直接访问结果。 4. **异步函数**：注意，由于\`sqlx\`是异步的，你需要在一个异步环境中执行查询——这就是为什么我们使用\`#[tokio::main]\`将\`main\`函数标记为异步。 确保你已经设定了正确的数据库URL，并且数据库是可达的，表和字段也和你在查询中指定的相符。如果你遇到任何类型的错误，首先检查数据库连接和查询语句是否正确。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Conflicts were no longer now between the holders of various rights, but rather between owners and non-owners of means of production and manufacturing permits; they were no longer the affair of a corporation, but a private labour relationship. The courts in this connection, too, were no longer places where holders of various rights encountered each other formally. After the Revolution, therefore, the number of such court cases fell dramatically. The Revolution, as Michael Sonenscher writes,115 changed the institutional context in which labour relations were based and developed. From now on, there were no longer set wages that had to be adhered to by all masters of a guild, no rights to definite meal breaks and to certain forms of mutual respect between guild members. Or, rather, wherever claims of this kind still persisted after the Revolution, they had to be made by journeymen and apprentices outside of the corporate context. As William M. Reddy has shown, the ‘rights' of workers in the productive process had still not been completely abolished in practice even at the end of the nineteenth century, and capitalists still had to struggle to assert their power of command over the production process;116 but, already in 1791, the conditions for such disputes fundamentally altered. This change was expressed in linguistic usage. Before the Revolution, there had been much talk of freedom and the refusal to be treated as slaves, but after the Revolution, the discourse of solidarity spread. For, after the dissolution of the forms of property of the ancien régime, it was workers' solidarity that formed the basis for their pursuit of common interests. For this reason, the combinations of the nineteenth century - which had been made illegal already by the loi Le Chapelier of 1791 - were not just a continuation of those of the eighteenth century, but were combinations of interests in opposition to the similar combinations of masters (also illegal under the same law). The so-called rixes, battles among workers that the police reports of the first decades of the new century are full of, make clear how even competition between workers had been ‘deregulated'. When Agricol Perdiquer, known as Avignonais Le Vertu, called on his fellow workers to leave off such battles - which had become an obligatory ritual - and instead struggle together for work and bread,117 he still found little response. Only after the mid-century, in changed economic conditions, did modern forms of representation of interest replace the cudgels and fists that workers had wielded against one another. Many authors equate the abolition of seigneurie with the abolition of collec-tive peasant usufruct.118 But collective peasant usufruct was a major exception from the principle of absolute private property, with long-term structural effects, being certainly a property in the form of privilege. There were indeed landowners who sought the abolition of collective rights. A decree of 5-12 June 1791 claimed - wrongly in terms of legal theory, but instructive precisely for that reason - that the territory of France was as free as the individuals who inhabited it.119 It was in this way that the revolutionaries founded their commitment to the ‘emancipation' of land from the ‘un-freedoms' imposed on it under the ancien régime, so that the freed land could be transferred to the free disposal of free individuals. In fact, however, there were even many deputies in the National Assembly who hesitated about making such a radical intervention in the rural social structure. The law of 1791 (28 September/ 6 October) also retained the rights of vaine pâture and parcours. Although it was not just landowners, but also peasants who mainly cultivated their own land, who were opposed to general pasturage and droving rights, these collective peasant rights remained protected by law for a further hundred years. In 1791, the free power of disposal over property in land was only established by law in so far as owners were allowed to enclose their land (and in this way restrict peasant usufruct by an additional investment), have their own cattle graze separately from the common herd, and depart from the locally established rotation of crops. None of these freedoms, however, was implemented in practice right away. The question of common land was particularly contested. In principle, there were to be no more mixed property rights, and former common land was thus to be privatised. It was initially decided in 1792 that common land which seigneurs had appropriated should be returned to the community. The Constituent Assembly could not agree however on the appropriate way to make this 'partition'. In many places, peasants undertook the partition them-selves. Finally, in June 1793, the Assembly decided that common land should be divided up if at least a third of the villagers were in favour. For a long time, this law was seen by historians as the origin of the reinforcement of small peasant agriculture. In actual fact, however, as P.M. Jones sums up more recent research,120 only a small part of common land was divided. The partage was left incomplete, writes Jones, because it was really in nobody's interest. The better-off peasants feared losing cheap labour-power if poor peasant families received enough land for them to reproduce themselves without wagelabour. Poor peasants, for their part, found that a small and isolated parcel of land was little use to them, and finally the partage presupposed that there were alternative grazing opportunities. The end result, according to Jones, was that, after the Revolution, even more peasants enjoyed collective usufruct rights than before.121 One key part of the appropriation structure of the ancien régime thus remained in place. It enabled even those peasants who had not received any 'national goods' to continue reproducing themselves as peasants. In many regions of France, the social structures of peasant society remained intact from the late eighteenth century until the Great War;122 everywhere, practices of self-sufficiency only gradually declined in the course of the nineteenth century. By defending their collective rights, both those formally guaranteed and those formally annulled, peasants set limits to strategies of agricultural mod-ernisation. To this extent they played a part in the emergence of the social type of the landowning notable (often noble) of the early nineteenth century. By making strategies of capitalisation more difficult, they confirmed in their own way the self-consciousness of the notables that they were eminent lords - in the traditional sense - and that income from landownership was still something quite other than income from other kinds of business. The Revolution established the private character of property and the objec-tive structure of economic relations between persons, but only in principle and not completely. Taken as a whole, however, a separation of economics and politics can be maintained. The reduction of rule to politics and to paid activity separated the state from society. d. Emperor, king and notables: the French constitution of the bourgeois state When Napoleon became emperor, he surrounded himself with a court, and his court ceremonial included the ruler's traditional lever. There was also a new stratum of nobles. When the Allies sent Napoleon off to Elba, and appointed Louis XVI's brother as king (the dauphin having died in childhood), this Louis XVIII had the palace of Versailles restored and proclaimed he was king by the grace of God. William Crawford, the American ambassador in Paris, saw all this as ridiculous pretence.123 But, even after the hiatus in his reign caused by Napoleon's temporary return to power, Louis XVIII continued to present himself as a king of the ancien régime. He had scrofula patients brought before him to lay hands on as befitted a French king.124 But no more than Napoleon restored personal rule125 did the Allies restore the monarchical rule of the Bourbons after Napoleon's final defeat. No king of the ancien régime, not even Louis XIV, had anything like as much power as Napoleon. Napoleon was in a position - for a time - to command the public power of ‘the nation' and make use of a state apparatus that had been formed by the Revolution as an instrument of government. The structure of the centralised administrative state arose from the revolutionary destruction of all intermediate powers, and from the prevailing practice, since the Directory, of using the administration as an instrument for the regulation of the political public. This political instrumentalisation of the administrative apparatus made it possible for senior state officials to construct a position for themselves that protected them against political changes. When Napoleon fell, the administration remained. Since the politically influential strata of society long tried to prevent the practice of state power being subject to the control of a broad public, state officials were able to appropriate considerable competence of definition over their own practice in office. The roots of the French nomenklatura, as Alexander Wickham and Sophie Coignard describe the present-day stratum of top administrators,126 grew out of the French form of bourgeois revolution.”翻译为中文","output":"行会特权的废除意味着劳动关系的私有化。冲突不再是各种权利持有者之间的冲突，而是生产手段和制造许可证的所有者与非所有者之间的冲突；它们不再是行会的事务，而是私人劳动关系。在这种情况下，法院也不再是各种权利持有者正式相遇的地方。因此，革命之后，此类法院案件的数量急剧下降。正如迈克尔·索南舍尔所写，革命改变了劳动关系所基于和发展的制度环境。从现在起，不再有行会中所有师傅必须遵守的固定工资，不再有权利享有确定的用餐时间和行会成员之间某些形式的相互尊重。或者，更准确地说，革命之后，如果学徒和杂工们还要提出此类要求，他们必须在行会的背景之外进行。正如威廉·M·雷迪所展示的，即使到了19世纪末，生产过程中工人的“权利”在实践中仍然没有完全被废除，资本家们仍然必须努力维护他们对生产过程的指挥权；但是，早在1791年，此类争议的条件就已根本改变。这种变化在语言使用中得到了体现。革命之前，自由和拒绝被当作奴隶的讨论很多，但革命之后，团结的话语开始传播。因为，在旧制度的产权形式解体后，正是工人的团结形成了他们追求共同利益的基础。出于这个原因，19世纪的结合体——早在1791年就已经被 Le Chapelier 法律禁止了——不仅仅是18世纪那些结合体的延续，而是与师傅们（在同一法律下也是非法的）类似的组合体的利益相反。新世纪头几十年的警察报告中提到的所谓rixes，工人之间的战斗，清楚地显示了工人之间的竞争是如何被“放任自流”的。当阿格里科尔·珀迪克尔，被称为阿维尼翁的勒韦尔图，呼吁他的同事们放弃这种已成为强制性仪式的战斗，转而共同为工作和面包而斗争时，他仍然得到了很少的回应。只有在世纪中叶经济条件发生变化后，现代利益代表形式才取代了工人之前对彼此使用的棍棒和拳头。 许多作者将领地权的废除等同于集体农民使用权的废除。但是，集体农民使用权是绝对私有财产原则的一个主要例外，具有长期的结构性影响，无疑是一种特权形式的财产。确实有地主寻求废除集体权利。1791年6月5日至12日的一项法令声称——尽管从法律理论上说是错误的，但正因为如此，它在说明问题时尤其有指导意义——法国的领土与居住在其上的个人一样自由。这就是革命者们基于对土地的“解放”承诺的方式，即从旧制度下加诸其上的“不自由”中解放出来，从而可以将解放的土地自由地转让给自由的个人。然而，事实上，在国民议会中甚至有许多代表对进行如此激进的干预农村社会结构持犹豫态度。1791年法律（9月28日/10月6日）也保留了对公共放牧权和赶牲口权的权利。尽管不仅是地主，而且主要耕种自己土地的农民也反对普遍放牧和赶牲口的权利，但这些集体农民权利仍然受到法律保护达一百年之久。在1791年，只有在允许土地所有者围起自己的土地（通过额外投资限制农民的使用权）、让自己的牲畜与公共牲畜分开放牧、并且脱离当地确定的轮作制度的情况下，才通过法律建立了对土地财产的自由处置权。然而，这些自由当时并没有立即在实践中实施。 公共土地的问题尤其有争议。原则上，不应再有混合产权，因此以前的公共土地应该被私有化。最初在1792年决定，应该将地主占有的公共土地归还给社区。然而，制宪议会却未能就如何进行这种“分割”达成一致。在许多地方，农民自行进行了分割。最后，在1793年6月，议会决定，如果至少有三分之一的村民赞成，就应该分割公共土地。长期以来，历史学家将这项法律视为增强小农农业力量的起源。实际上，然而，正如P.M. 琼斯总结的更多近期研究所指出的，只有一小部分公共土地被分割。琼斯写道，分割之所以未完成，是因为实际上没人对此感兴趣。富裕的农民担心，如果贫穷的农民家庭获得足够的土地，使他们能够在不依赖工资劳动的情况下自给自足，他们将会失去廉价劳动力。另一方面，贫穷的农民发现，一小块孤立的地块对他们几乎无用，而且，分割还假设有替代的放牧机会。结果，据琼斯说，革命后，甚至有更多的农民享有集体使用权。一个旧制度时代占有结构的关键部分因而得以保留。它使那些没有获得任何“国家财产”的农民也能继续以农民的身份生存下去。在许多法国地区，从18世纪末一直到大战时期，农民社会的社会结构保持不变；在整个19世纪，自给自足的做法只是逐渐减少。通过捍卫他们的集体权利，无论是正式保障的还是正式废除的，农民限制了农业现代化的策略。在这个程度上，他们在19世纪早期土地所有权显赫（往往是贵族）社会类型的出现中发挥了作用。通过使资本化策略更加困难，他们以自己的方式证实了显赫阶层的自我意识，即他们是传统意义上的杰出领主，土地所有权的收入仍然与其他商业活动的收入大不相同。 革命确立了财产的私有性质和人与人之间经济关系的客观结构，但这只是原则上的，而不是完全的。总的来说，然而，经济和政治的分离可以维持。将统治减少到政治和有偿活动将国家与社会分开。 d. 皇帝、国王和显赫人物：资产阶级国家的法国宪法 当拿破仑成为皇帝时，他围绕自己建立了一个朝廷，他的朝廷仪式包括传统的君主起床仪式。还有一个新的贵族阶层。当盟国将拿破仑流放到厄尔巴岛，并任命路易十六的弟弟为国王（太子在童年时就已去世）时，这位路易十八修复了凡尔赛宫并宣布他是上帝恩赐的国王。威廉·克劳福德，美国驻巴黎大使，将所有这些视为可笑的伪装。但是，即使是在拿破仑短暂恢复权力引起他统治中断后，路易十八继续将自己呈现为旧制度下的国王。他命人将患有痼疾的病人带到他面前，让他按手治疗，正如法国国王所应做的。但不仅拿破仑没有恢复个人统治，盟国在拿破仑最终失败后也没有恢复波旁王朝的君主统治。 没有一个旧制度的国王，甚至路易十四，拥有像拿破仑那样的权力。拿破仑一度能够——在一段时间内——指挥“国家”的公共权力，并利用革命形成的国家机器作为政府的工具。中央集权行政国家的结构源于所有中间权力的革命性破坏，以及自导向时代以来，将行政当作规范政治公共领域的工具的普遍做法。这种行政机构的政治工具化使得高级国家官员能够构建一个保护他们免受政治变动影响的职位。当拿破仑倒台时，行政机构仍然存在。由于长期以来社会具有政治影响力的阶层努力阻止国家权力实践受到广泛公众的控制，国家官员能够对他们的官职实践拥有相当大的定义权。正如亚历山大·威克姆和索菲·科尼亚所描述的当今高级行政阶层的根源，源自法国资产阶级革命的形式。"},{"instruction":"请将“A second structural feature of French political development was the destruc-tion of the political and cultural hegemony of the nobility by the Revolution. There continued to be for the entire nineteenth century a remarkable number of citizens in leading positions - especially at a local level - who boasted a noble title. The attraction of such a title continued to be high enough for many families to make great efforts to add a particule to their name, which in due course was taken as a predicate of nobility. In this way, Delatre became de Lattre de Tassigny, Franchet Desperet became Franchet d'Esperey, and Giscard became Giscard d'Estaing.127 If forms of noble rule were not restored in the post-revolutionary society, nor did any effective unity of the noble stratum arise, this can be ascribed most readily to the fact that those noble families whose predecessors had been included in the Second Estate before the Revolution, very quickly composed themselves into a culturally exclusive social group. Their members oriented themselves to their traditional professions, married almost exclusively within their own ranks, and developed habitual forms of behaviour by which they liked to distinguish themselves from the parvenus. At the local level, they sometimes even practised forms of their earlier rule. Many a noble family still continued to defend for a long time the privilege of not having to sit among the common people in church. Precisely because the legitimacy of a ‘noble lifestyle' had been permanently destroyed by the Revolution, the symbols and phrases of noble culture could much later become widespread as a decorative element in mass culture.128 But the ‘prince of dribble', or 'Princes' dry cleaning', has nothing to do with the actual exercise of noble rule. The contents of that certain 'distinction', which demands more respect in French society than in any other bourgeois society, were determined in France by actual social struggles, and not - as in England - by a long hegemonic noble culture. There is one respect in which the thesis of the unity of notables that was current for a while among historians can be vindicated. The experiences of the Revolution united the materially and politically dominant strata of France for a long time in an effort to control the 'people' as effectively as possible. This effort was so substantial that not only was the right to take part in political decision-making drastically curtailed, but even the formal universality of the bourgeois state was for a time abolished. The reintroduction of the livret (workbook) in 1803 established a legal inequality of citizens, and the formal favouring of the testimony of masters in cases of labour conflict - in the 1804 Code Civil - even meant inequality before the courts. The order to possess a livret and present this to the police on each change of address was extended to women in 1851, and remained in law until 1890. The legal favouring of masters' testimony continued until 1866. The citoyens and citoyennes who had explained to others how a citizen was to live were transformed by the ruling strata of the post-revolutionary society into members of the 'dangerous classes'. Were they actually dangerous? As a result of the Revolution, many of them still had strong republican sentiments in the early nineteenth century and beyond. We can just give one of these republicans the final word here. In Floréal of Year XII (May 1804), François Léon appeared in court. He had gone to the prefecture of police in Paris for his livret. Although, as he said, he had concluded that he had no alternative but to bow to the new rules, he could not restrain himself from political comments. When he was arrested, he was found to have little notes insulting the emperor and criticising the political situation. In the hearing, he explained that he wrote these notes himself and stuck them on the walls of buildings, so that it looked as if people shared his opinions. Asked for his reasons, he explained: I am very republican. I am told that the first consul is now emperor. That doesn't suit me at all. . . . I am told that we are free, but no one really is free. The workers are forced to have livrets, but one can manage perfectly well without them . . . François Léon was locked away. In July his sister appealed for clemency. The result of this and the length of his sentence are unknown.129 Part Four Results of the Historical Comparison For neither of the two national developments investigated here is it possible to explain the historical rise of the bourgeois state in terms of the functional requirements of economic development. Besides, neither the point in time at which the societies of the 'ancien-régime' structural type studied here were revolutionised, nor the political form in which this took place, was determined by the degree of capitalisation of the relations of production. The most important structural preconditions for the crisis of personal rule rather resulted from the manner in which the members of the privileged estates acquired, main-tained and defended their ruling status. The emergence of personal rule and the change in its practice was a process in which everyone was involved, from the king, through the nobles, down to peasants, soldiers, beggar-men - even women who are left out of such nursery rhymes. Their respective actions naturally had varying prospects of success. Of the many different preconditions that were present in generalised social practice in the epoch of the ancien régime, one in particular needs special emphasis: the distribution of rule-holding among the lords. If this was not completely contingent in relation to the social organisation of production, it was indeed largely so. It created quite specific conditions, moreover, for the development of the nobility and along with this the handling of crises of rule. To avoid misunderstanding: this chapter will deal less with the general causes of the revolutionary processes that led to the emergence of bourgeois state power, than with the structural preconditions for the varying character of the bourgeois revolution. To anticipate one important result, though the structural preconditions for the handling of crises of rule that arose in the course of the ancien régime did not determine the actual course of the transformation process, these did set the context within which concrete social practice could develop. I. The conditions of personal rule in England and France Structural differences between 'manor' and 'seigneurie banale' The most important difference in the present connection lies in the extent of royal or princely rule over the distribution of power competences and land. When the Norman duke and his barons conquered England and drove the indigenous aristocracy from power, rule over the entire kingdom, its land and its people, fell entirely to the new king. He granted tenancies to his barons. Taxation and the organisation of general arming was carried out on his orders, and he also decreed that the existing forms of local judicial practice should be continued. Attempts by particular barons to expand their estates and appropriate legal competences were not completely prevented, but the structurally determining fact was the ability of the Norman-Angevin kings to grant tenancies as ‘gifts with obligations'. These gifts were both conditional and limited. Conditional, in that they demanded loyalty and allegiance - including the provision of armed men for the king's undertakings -, and limited, to the extent that disposal over generalised fiscal, legal and military competences was not privatised. The manorial form of rule, in which lordship in England became institutionalised in the course of the twelfth century, served the English barons as the form of seigneurie banale served the French sires, to maintain and expand their competence of appropriation by the threatened and actual use of force, both over those peasants who had already been forced into dependence before the Conquest, and over those who were at that time still free. In many cases the lords of the manor succeeded in incorporating village judicial practice into the manorial courts that they increasingly transformed into an instrument of rule. The regalia however continued to belong to the king alone. From the second half of the twelfth century on, judicial practice in the counties was generalised in the common law, the law of the king, and organised as he decreed. Even if the king's officials made use of local lords, and the latter often felt sufficiently obliged to help members of their household to a favourable decision by a demonstration of armed force, the extent of royal rule restricted the manor to a principally economic form of power. From the reign of Henry II (1154-89), free peasants had the right to complain to the king's courts even against their own lords. That many of them fought for this free status shows that it was more than a mere formality. If we take feudal relations as a measure, England was the most thoroughly feudalised kingdom of the late Middle Ages, but, if the concept of feudalism is seen as involving a parcellisation of generalised power competences (what historians often retrospectively describe already as ‘sovereign' competences), then England does not fit this picture, since the competences of lordship were both guaranteed and restricted by a generalised royal power that was founded on armed force.”翻译为中文","output":"法国政治发展的第二个结构特征是革命摧毁了贵族的政治和文化霸权。在整个19世纪，尤其是在地方一级，仍有相当数量的担任领导职务的公民拥有贵族头衔。对这样一个头衔的吸引力足够高，以至于许多家庭付出巨大努力为自己的名字增加一个颗粒，这随着时间的推移被视为贵族身份的标志。这样，Delatre变成了de Lattre de Tassigny，Franchet Desperet变成了Franchet d'Esperey，Giscard变成了Giscard d'Estaing。 如果在后革命社会中没有恢复贵族统治的形式，贵族阶层也没有形成任何有效的统一，这主要可以归因于一个事实，那就是那些贵族家庭，他们的祖先在革命前被纳入第二等级，很快就将自己组织成一个文化上排他的社会团体。他们的成员以传统职业为导向，几乎只在自己的阶层内结婚，并发展出他们喜欢用来区分自己与暴发户的习惯性行为方式。在地方层面，他们有时甚至实践他们早期统治的形式。许多贵族家庭仍长时间继续捍卫在教堂中不必与普通人坐在一起的特权。正是因为革命永久破坏了“贵族生活方式”的合法性，贵族文化的符号和短语后来才能作为装饰元素在大众文化中广泛传播。但是，“运球王子”或“王子干洗店”与贵族统治的实际行使无关。在法国社会比其他任何资产阶级社会都更受尊敬的那种特定的“区别”的内容，是由实际的社会斗争决定的，而不是——如同在英国——由一个长期的贵族霸权文化决定的。 在一个方面，关于显赫人物统一性的论断一度在历史学家中流行，可以被证实是有根据的。革命的经历长时间地团结了法国在物质和政治上占主导地位的阶层，以尽可能有效地控制“人民”。这种努力是如此重大，以至于不仅政治决策参与权被大幅削弱，甚至资产阶级国家的形式普遍性也在一段时间内被废除。1803年重新引入劳动手册建立了公民之间的法律不平等，以及1804年民法典中在劳动冲突案件中对雇主证词的正式偏袒，甚至意味着在法庭面前的不平等。每次地址变更都必须持有劳动手册并向警方出示的要求在1851年扩展到女性，并一直保留在法律中直到1890年。对雇主证词的法律偏袒一直持续到1866年。那些向他人解释如何生活的公民和公民妇女，被后革命社会的统治阶层转变为“危险阶层”的成员。 他们真的危险吗？由于革命的结果，许多人在19世纪初及以后仍有强烈的共和主义情绪。我们可以在这里引用一位共和主义者的最后一句话。在十二年Floréal(1804年5月)，弗朗索瓦·莱昂出庭。他去巴黎警察局领取他的劳动手册。尽管他说，他认为自己别无选择，只能遵从新规则，但他还是忍不住发表了政治评论。当他被逮捕时，人们发现他带有侮辱皇帝和批评政治局势的小便条。在听证会上，他解释说，这些便条是他自己写的，并贴在建筑物的墙上，好像人们分享了他的观点。被问及他的理由时，他解释道： 我非常共和。我被告知第一执政现在是皇帝。这一点都不适合我...我被告知我们是自由的，但实际上没有人真正自由。工人被迫持有劳动手册，但实际上完全可以没有它们... 弗朗索瓦·莱昂被关了起来。7月，他的妹妹请求宽恕。这件事的结果和他的判决时长是未知的。 第四部分 历史比较的结果 对于这里调查的两个国家的发展，不可能用经济发展的功能要求来解释资产阶级国家的历史兴起。此外，“旧体制”结构类型社会的革命时间点，以及革命发生的政治形式，都不是由生产关系资本化的程度决定的。导致个人统治危机的最重要的结构性前提，主要源于特权阶层成员获得、维护和捍卫其统治地位的方式。 个人统治的出现和实践变化是一个过程，涉及从国王到贵族，再到农民、士兵、乞丐，甚至那些被排除在这样的童谣之外的女性，每个人都参与其中。他们各自的行动自然有着不同的成功前景。在旧体制时代普遍的社会实践中存在许多不同的前提条件，其中一个特别需要强调：统治权在领主之间的分配。如果这与生产的社会组织并非完全偶然相关，那么实际上它在很大程度上是如此。它还为贵族的发展以及处理统治危机创造了特定的条件。为避免误解：本章将不那么关注导致资产阶级国家权力出现的革命过程的一般原因，而是关注资产阶级革命性质变化的结构性前提条件。预期一个重要结果，尽管在旧体制过程中出现的处理统治危机的结构性前提条件并没有决定实际的转变过程，但这些确实设定了具体社会实践能够发展的背景。 一、英国和法国个人统治的条件 “庄园”和“普通领主权”之间的结构差异 目前最重要的区别在于皇家或亲王对权力和土地分配的统治范围。 当诺曼公爵及其男爵征服英格兰并将土著贵族赶下台时，对整个王国及其土地和人民的统治完全归新国王所有。他将领地授予他的男爵。征税和组织总动员是根据他的命令进行的，他还下令继续现有的地方司法实践形式。特定男爵试图扩大他们的领地并占有法律权力的尝试并未完全被阻止，但结构性决定性的事实是诺曼-安茹国王有能力作为“有义务的赠予”授予领地。这些赠予既有条件也有限制。有条件的，因为它们要求忠诚和效忠 - 包括为国王的行动提供武装人员 -，并且有限制，因为对一般化的财政、法律和军事权力的处置没有被私有化。 庄园形式的统治，是12世纪英格兰男爵们以“普通领主权”形式维护和扩大他们的占有权力的手段，通过威胁和实际使用武力，既针对那些在征服之前已被迫陷入依赖的农民，也针对那些当时仍然自由的农民。在许多情况下，庄园领主成功地将村庄司法实践并入他们越来越多地转变为统治工具的庄园法庭中。然而，王权仍然只属于国王。从12世纪下半叶开始，各郡的司法实践在国王的普通法中得到概括，并按照他的命令组织。即使国王的官员利用了地方领主，后者经常觉得有足够的义务凭借武装力量的展示帮助其家庭成员获得有利的判决，但国王的统治范围限制了庄园主要是一种经济形式的权力。从亨利二世（1154-89年在位）开始，自由农民有权甚至反对自己的领主向国王的法院投诉。许多人为争取这种自由地位而斗争，表明这不仅仅是形式上的。 如果我们以封建关系为标准，英格兰是中世纪晚期封建制度最为彻底的王国，但是，如果封建主义的概念被视为涉及一般化权力（历史学家常常事后已经描述为“主权”权力）的分割，那么英格兰并不符合这一模式，因为领主的权力既被普遍的皇家权力所保障也受到限制，而这种皇家权力是建立在武装力量之上的。"},{"instruction":"请将“Generalisations about ‘France' have to bear in mind two important facts. The form of seigneurie that was implemented from the tenth century, and espe-cially in the eleventh, also subjected previously free peasants to the power of lords, and by the use and threat of armed force and judicial power, reduced their status to that of earlier slaves - many of whom also held land. The second important fact concerns royal rule. Outside of the crown domains - and even there only to a limited extent - the kings of the tenth and eleventh centuries had no power to make use of the prerogatives that their predecessors had appropriated. A generalised fiscal power continued to exist, but its proceeds were competed for by local lords, with the king being largely excluded. In western Gaul, certain princes managed to build castles and thus keep fiscal and judicial power under their control. In other regions, the burgraves who had formerly been agents of the king kept the proceeds of generalised extrac-tion for themselves. Many ‘strong men' also made themselves into burgraves and hence possessors of ruling competences. To the south of Burgundy, rich townsmen also shared the possession of local ruling power, in regionally dif-ferent forms. In general, it is possible to conclude, with a certain degree of caution, that the parcellising of local power increased in the course of the elev-enth century, particularly by way of inheritances, so that by 1200 a seigneurie often comprised no more than a single parish, while castles had lost their former significance as organising instances and symbols of ruling power. Not every local sire exercised the same degree of seigneurial rule, and the manner in which judicial and fiscal power was graduated differed from that of ter-ritorial rule. What is important here is that, while kings succeeded from the thirteenth century onward in making the territorial princes into ‘mere barons' (K.F. Werner), i.e. establishing themselves as their lords, this did not put them in a position to integrate the seigneuries banales into their own rule. With this reservation, which should be borne in mind for all the gener-alisations and tendencies formulated below, we can maintain that the manor tied the status of a family far more clearly to the size of its land-holding than was the case with the seigneurie. In ‘France', on the other hand, possession of legal rights was of greater significance for appropriation and status. Studies of judicial processes among lords bear out this interpretation: in England, it was questions of holdings that were dominant, while in ‘France' the prevailing contention was over rights. The relation between secular and religious power Archbishops, bishops and abbots in England received tenancies from the king. They were obliged to assist him with advice and prayer, and, in most cases, also by providing armed men. There was a separate church jurisdiction, but all disputes over land-holdings were excluded from this; structurally typical for the feudal era in England is the participation of bishops in royal judicial practice and thus the exercise of royal rule. Even if the strength of certain bishops in England very often far exceeded that of secular barons, it remained dependent to a great degree on their loyalty to the king. It may have been politically risky to use the power of enfeoffment against bishops, but the possibility of refusing tenancy if an ecclesiastical choice did not please the king, and the limitation of the secular power of the lords of the church to those rights that other lords of the manor equally enjoyed, provided the medieval English kings with a far-reaching involvement in the exercise of religious rule. In ‘France', the Carolingian church had broken up with the demise of the Carolingian empire. Only in the king's direct sphere of rule did earlier struc-tures of the unity of religious and secular rule still obtain, while the connection of bishops to the king was altogether closer than those of counts and dukes. The tendency in the north of the country was for secular lords to appropriate disposal over church rule and offices, while in the south bishops appropriated seigneurial power. By and large, in the course of the tenth century episcopal rule was largely reduced to a power of appropriation. There was no counter-part to this in England. Though here too there was a reform movement, in France the rise of the monasteries was far more clearly directed against epis-copal rule. With papal support, the monasteries won immunity against this - most clearly in the case of the Cluniac movement. Nowhere was the papal strategy of subjecting secular lords more successful than in the south of France. In the last third of the eleventh century, the dio-ceses there fell under the control of papal legates. Once secular lords acquired church governorships, as a way of encroaching on the competences of bishops, peasants found themselves exposed to the claims of competing lords. In the wake of the military-fiscal and eventually also judicial expansion of royal rule, the kings of France finally achieved, but only in the fifteenth century, what had already been the situation in England since the Norman Conquest: the integration of church rule into the structures of generalised monarchical power. The relationship between crown and church, however, remained substantially more competitive than in England, owing to the greater papal influence in France. Preconditions for the constitution of the nobility as an estate The generalisation of the monopoly on land has a clear relevance in our ana-lytical framework. The transformation of an aristocracy of de facto powerful lineages into a legally privileged estate of landowners was marked everywhere by the manner of princely or royal rule. Where this rule was weak, different conditions for the rise and reproduction of the nobility were established territorially, according to the character of local princely rule. In England, there were de facto privileged nobles already before the Conquest, and to some extent also legally privileged ones. The rule of the Norman barons resulted from the combination of peasant subjugation and royal rule already implemented in ‘old England' with the forms of rule that prevailed in Normandy. These last had changed in the first half of the eleventh century. An aristocracy of warriors had developed into a landed nobility. 'Baro' no longer described the men of the ducal court, but only those of the retinue who held substantial land as a fief. In England, this transformation process was accelerated. Barons were the tenants of the king, bound to him by oaths that were based on the royal power's monopoly of land. The development into nobility as an estate resulted from the generalisation of interests of the tenants- in-chief vis-à-vis the king. In order to achieve the heritability of fiefs, military obligations had to be fiscalised. Monetary obligations could be met even by children and women, and by elderly or sick heirs to a barony. The general sharpening of fiscal exploitation of royal enfeoffment power, though varying in particular cases, provoked a generalisation of the interests of tenants in a regulation of the exercise of this power. In a situation of military defeat and a threat therefore to honour, possessions and the lives of the barons and their families, these interests could be asserted against the crown. Magna Carta in 1215 marked the start of a formalisation of the conditions for the English king's ruling practice. But the generalised fiscal, judicial and military power of the sovereign was challenged neither at this time nor later. What was formalised first of all was feudal appropriation. The direct per-sonal relationship between the king and his tenants was not abolished by this change, but simply integrated into a generalised form. This process of generalisation of the conditions of reproduction heralds the beginning of the development of an estate structure of nobility. The foundation of generalised royal power competence in the land monopoly is still more clear in the deter-mination of membership of the nobility. When all knights were required for the first time in 1286 to swear obedience to the king, knights were defined as those who had been dubbed, and had thus acquired this honour in a material sense. The barons and most of their sons counted as knights, but so did many of their arrière-ban along with their sons. Knights in England, already from the late thirteenth century, were therefore not only obliged to their immediate lord or the lord of the ‘house' in which they lived, but directly also to the king. This completed the transformation of a military ‘profession' into a land-owning estate in connection with the generalised royal rule. In England, the crown obliged all those who obtained a certain level of income from land to have themselves dubbed as knights, and stand at the disposal of the crown for the judicial and administrative practice of royal rule. (Even though in some cases this measure succeeded only in fiscal terms.) This transformation of knights into an estate reached its culmination when representatives of the landowners who were sent to Parliament described themselves as ‘knights of the shire' even if they had not been dubbed knights and did not practice the military art. The general characteristic of the English nobility, its constitution as a land-owning service nobility, was already fully formed in the late Middle Ages.”翻译为中文","output":"关于“法国”的概括必须记住两个重要事实。从十世纪开始，尤其是在十一世纪，实施的领主制度也使先前自由的农民受到领主的权力制约，通过使用和威胁使用武装力量及司法权力，将他们的地位降低到早期奴隶的地位——其中许多人也拥有土地。第二个重要事实涉及皇家统治。在王室领地之外 —— 即使在那里也只是在有限范围内 —— 十世纪和十一世纪的国王无权利用其前任所占有的特权。一般化的财政权力仍然存在，但其收益被地方领主争夺，国王基本被排除在外。在高卢西部，一些王子设法建造城堡，从而将财政和司法权力掌控在自己手中。在其他地区，曾经是国王代理人的城主自己保留了一般性提取的收益。许多“强人”也将自己变成了城主，从而成为统治能力的拥有者。在勃艮第以南，富裕的城镇居民也以不同地区的形式共享地方统治权。总的来说，在十一世纪的过程中，可以小心地得出结论，地方权力的分割在通过继承等方式增加，以至于到1200年，一个领主领地往往不过就是一个单独的教区，而城堡已失去了其作为统治力量组织和象征的先前意义。并非每个地方的领主都行使相同程度的领主权，司法权和财政权的分级与领土统治的方式不同。这里重要的是，尽管从十三世纪开始国王成功地将领土亲王变成了“仅仅是男爵”（K.F. Werner），即确立了他们作为国王的领主地位，但这并没有使他们能够将普通领主权纳入自己的统治之中。 在下文提出的所有概括和趋势中都应记住这一保留意见，我们可以认为，庄园将一个家庭的地位与其土地所有权的规模联系得更加清晰，这与普通领主权的情况不同。另一方面，在“法国”，法律权利的拥有对于占有和地位更为重要。对领主之间司法程序的研究证实了这一解释：在英格兰，主要是土地持有的问题占主导地位，而在“法国”，主要是关于权利的争议。 世俗权力与宗教权力之间的关系 在英格兰，大主教、主教和修道院院长从国王那里获得封地。他们有义务为国王提供建议和祷告，而且在大多数情况下，也要提供武装人员。存在一个独立的教会管辖权，但所有关于土地持有的争议都不包括在内；典型的英格兰封建时代结构是主教参与国王的司法实践，也就是行使国王的统治权。即使某些主教在英格兰的力量往往远远超过了世俗的男爵，他们的力量也在很大程度上依赖于对国王的忠诚。对主教使用封地授予权可能具有政治风险，但如果教会选举结果不合国王心意，拒绝授予封地的可能性，以及将教会领主的世俗权力限制在其他庄园领主同样享有的权利上，为中世纪的英格兰国王提供了广泛参与宗教统治的权力。 在“法国”，随着加洛林帝国的衰落，加洛林教会也随之分崩离析。只有在国王直接统治的范围内，宗教与世俗统治的早期结构还得以保留，而主教与国王的联系比伯爵和公爵的联系更为紧密。北方的趋势是世俗领主占有教会统治和官职的处理权，而在南方，主教占有了领主权力。总的来说，在十世纪，主教统治大多被削弱为占有权力。在英格兰没有这样的对应情形。尽管这里也有一场改革运动，但在法国，修道院的崛起明显针对主教统治。在教皇的支持下，修道院赢得了免受这种统治的免疫权——克鲁尼运动的情况最为明显。 法国南部是教皇战略制服世俗领主最成功的地方。在十一世纪最后三分之一期间，那里的教区落入了教皇特使的控制之下。一旦世俗领主获得了教会长官的地位，作为侵占主教权力的一种方式，农民发现自己暴露在竞争领主的要求之下。随着王室统治在军事财政上的扩张，最终也包括司法上的扩张，法国国王终于在十五世纪实现了自诺曼征服以来英格兰一直处于的情况：将教会统治整合到普遍的君主权力结构中。然而，由于教皇在法国的影响力更大，王室与教会的关系仍然比在英格兰更具竞争性。 贵族作为一个阶层的构成先决条件 土地垄断的普遍化在我们的分析框架中具有清晰的相关性。实际上强大的家族贵族转变为具有法律特权的土地所有者贵族的过程，到处都被亲王或国王统治的方式所标志。在统治较弱的地方，按照地方亲王统治的性质，为贵族的崛起和再生产建立了不同的条件。 在征服前的英格兰，就已经存在事实上享有特权的贵族，某种程度上也有法律上享有特权的贵族。诺曼男爵的统治是“旧英格兰”中已经实施的农民征服和国王统治与在诺曼底盛行的统治形式的结合。这些最后提到的形式在十一世纪上半叶发生了变化。一支战士贵族发展成为土地贵族。'Baro'不再描述公爵庭院的人，而只描述那些作为封地拥有大片土地的随从。在英格兰，这一转变过程加速了。男爵是国王的封臣，通过基于土地垄断的国王权力的誓言与国王联系在一起。成为一个阶层的贵族的发展来自于与国王相对立的封臣们的利益普遍化。为了实现封地的可继承性，必须将军事义务货币化。即使是儿童、妇女和年老或生病的男爵继承人也可以满足货币义务。尽管在特定情况下各有不同，但国王对封地权力财政开发的普遍加剧激发了封臣们对于这种权力行使规则化的普遍兴趣。在军事失败和因此对男爵及其家庭的荣誉、财产和生命构成威胁的情况下，这些利益可以对抗王室。1215年的《大宪章》标志着英格兰国王统治实践条件的正式化开始。但是，无论是在这个时候还是以后，君主的普遍财政、司法和军事权力都没有受到挑战。 首先正式化的是封建占有权。国王与其封臣之间的直接个人关系并未因这一变化而被废除，而只是被整合到一个普遍化的形式中。这一再生产条件普遍化的过程预示着贵族阶层结构发展的开始。普遍化的王室权力在土地垄断中的基础在决定贵族成员资格时更加明显。当所有骑士首次在1286年被要求对国王宣誓效忠时，骑士被定义为那些被封为骑士的人，从而在物质意义上获得这一荣誉。男爵和他们的大多数儿子都被视为骑士，但他们的后备军和他们的儿子们也是如此。因此，从十三世纪晚期开始，英格兰的骑士不仅对他们直接的领主或他们所居住的“家”中的领主负有义务，而且也直接对国王负有义务。这完成了将军事“职业”转变为与普遍化的王室统治相联系的土地所有阶层的转变。在英格兰，王室要求所有从土地获得一定收入水平的人封为骑士，并为国王的司法和行政实践提供服务。（尽管在某些情况下，这一措施只在财政方面取得成功。）骑士转变为一个阶层的过程在被派往议会的地主代表即使他们没有被封为骑士也没有从事军事艺术时自称为“郡骑士”的时候达到高潮。英格兰贵族的通常特征，作为一个土地所有的服务贵族，到了中世纪晚期已经完全形成。"},{"instruction":"请将“A 'French' nobility developed only two centuries after the emergence of a noble estate in England. Though in Gaul kings continued to be elected who were no stronger than any of the other territorial princes of the kingdom, the symbolic power of the kings that was sanctioned by the church and not generally contested was insufficient to check the transformation of a warrior aristocracy into a landowning one. Yet there also arose in France - in the south, however, only in the course of the fourteenth century - a landed nobility with duties and rights vis-à-vis the generalised power. This process was effected in a context of regionally different forms of rule and with territorially different preconditions and results. One varying precondition, for example, was the fact that in many regions more or less all free men were described as nobili while in others this elevation was restricted to the more powerful of their number. The number of nobili and the average size of their holdings varied accordingly. There were several regions where many of the nobili hailed from lineages of the old Carolingian service nobility, while in others - especially the border regions - 'strong men' in the tenth century had a particularly favourable opportunity to make themselves into castellans possessing seigneurial power. Finally, there were tremendous differences in the distribution and the articulation of feudal structures. At certain times there was scarcely anything in common between Normandy, for example, where the situation was very similar to that in England, and the structures of rule in the south. In the north of France a combination of feudal relationship and homage (an oath of allegiance to the feudal lord) generally developed into the dominant form of regular connection between magnates and those warriors who lived only temporarily in their household. In the south, on the other hand, there were for a long time oaths of allegiance without feudal relations - in some parts for the peasants as well. In so far as the personal tie was reinforced there by an 'obliging gift', this often related to material participation in fiscal competences. Whilst princes were inclined to interpret vassalage as a relationship that demanded obedience on the part of the vassals, many of the latter saw it only as an obligation to keep the peace. Which particular definition prevailed depended on the de facto possession of power. This situation was reproduced in the relationship between the territorial princes and the king. The southern lords dispensed with the journey that would have been necessary to pay homage to the king, whilst the northern territorial princes generally did travel to swear allegiance. Just like their own vassals, however, they were reluctant to interpret homage as the basis of a relationship of obedience. This kind of - feudal - interpretation only became a reality when kings had the military and fiscal strength to return territorial princes their former realm as a fief, under condition of obedience. Though initially in 'France', therefore, many different noble estates came into being, from the twelfth century on a notion of nobility came to prevail that transcended local differences. The ideal of knighthood generalised the behav-ioural norms and the claims to privilege of a noble stratum. The knightly ideal was certainly not invented by the clergy, but its diffusion stood in close connection with the generalised practice of church rule: the 'peace of God' movement and Crusade propaganda. The ideal of knighthood integrated the profession of arms into the Christian view of the world. It combined behav-ioural norms for warfare that were sanctioned by the church with forms of non-military discipline that served above all the development of courtoisie. Independently of whether these norms marked actual practice, knighthood came into its own as an estate in the course of the twelfth century. It served its members as the foundation of privileges, such as freedom from taxation and a particular regard for their privileged position in the event of penal proceedings. This social revaluation of knighthood altered little in the relationship of lords to peasants that was already established in practice. The claim to knighthood, however, organised an interest of the warriors in the social subjugation of all laymen who were not knights. The comparatively great importance that the ideal of knighthood acquired in 'France' for the emergence of a generalised conception of lordship corre-sponds to the comparatively more significant sacral interpretation of royal power. Whereas in England, irrespective of the royal myth that was also present there, a relatively modest relationship of the royal vassals to their lord emerged in a context where the exercise of royal power was important for the reproduction of the existence of the lords (a situation expressed in rebellions, when the practice of royal power ran counter to the generalised interests of the vassals), in medieval 'France' there was no rebellion of the nobility, despite the feuds between individual lords and the king. The kings of 'France' were not strong enough to provoke such rebellions. They were not even strong enough for the nobility to develop into an estate in respect to the generalised power in the kingdom. It is true that from 1285 ennoblement was documented by royal letters patent, but right into the fourteenth century the nobility of 'France' still existed principally in the form of different territorial noble estates or aristocracies. And though the princes of certain territories already at that time became barons of the king, meaning that royal judicial power extended not only to those princes but also to all their vassals, in the kingdom as a whole the generalisation of nobility was chiefly in respect to the myth of royal power and not in respect to feudal or seigneurial practice. Similarly to the English case, rise into the nobility and obtaining the status of lord depended also in medieval 'France' on the reproduction of a definite style of life, the material preconditions for this being derived from socially privileged sources: warfare, possession of seigneurial power, marriage, and to some degree also princely service (generally non-military). But whilst in England, already in the thirteenth century, availability for the king's service was established as the criterion for membership of the gentillesse, so that nobil-ity, though on the one hand a propertied estate, was also defined in relation to the exercise of royal rule, in 'France' at this time there was no definition of nobility that was founded on the generalised rule of the king, and consequently no general noble estate. Autonomy of the towns and their strivings for power England had no towns comparable with those of southern France. There an urban organisation - in the form of church rule - and an 'urban' culture had survived the demise of antiquity. In the Middle Ages, a secular aristocracy shared rule in southern France with the princes of the church, in a more-or- less competitive position. But the situation in northern France was also quite different from that in England. Though town-dwellers in England could cer-tainly acquire privileges, such as the right to collect the taxes to be delivered to the king, the room for manoeuvre for power strategies by the rich townsmen remained comparatively restricted by the English king's monopoly of land and ruling power. In France, on the other hand, the kings granted towns very far-reaching privileges. By granting both towns and monasteries immunity from their former seigneurs and, in this way, subjecting them directly to the crown, they created fiscal, judicial and military strongholds that they could use for strategies directed against the territorial rule of the nobles. Both in England and France there developed the type of town that Max Weber showed to be a structural feature of European feudalism: the town as legal person and the appropriation of corporate urban privileges by the leading social strata of townsmen. But, since the preconditions for the generalisation of royal rule differed fundamentally between the two kingdoms, in the long run there also resulted different structural preconditions for estate conflict between urban burghers and nobility. One of the structural preconditions for the long survival of the ancien régime in England was the limited autonomy of urban burgher power vis-à-vis the local exercise of rule based on the land monopoly of the nobles. Urban burgher power was unable to expand, and in many respects even began to decline, as royal rule in England was generalised not in competition with territorial noble rule, but - conversely - local noble rule was established in connection with an already generalised royal rule. 2. Conditions for the emergence of the ancien régime In both kingdoms, all forms of personal rule began to be objectified and monarchical rule was generalised. The general preconditions for these devel-opments arose from the expansion of the material basis of rule - the extension of cultivated land and the expansion of trade - as well as from the competitive structures of armed appropriation. Yet the widespread assumption in schol-arly literature that the expansion and objectification of generalised rule, com-monly described as the development of the 'state', was the result of increased monetarisation as well as a defence that had become necessary against peasant uprisings, can not be maintained. Although a certain degree of monetarisation was required for the fiscalising of personal rule, the expansion of monetarisation remained for many centuries a result of the exercise of rule. Peasants frequently found themselves compelled, in order to pay the taxes and other dues demanded of them, to offer for sale the proceeds of their production, even if these were necessary provisions for their family. Cause and effect are also commonly confused in the question of the suppression of peasant upris-ings. Though such uprisings regularly produced common actions on the part of the lords, these did not constitute any permanent generalisation of the pos-session of power. If this occurred for some other reasons, then the means of generalised power were employed in order to secure established rule. This in no way demonstrates any causal connection.”翻译为中文","output":"“法国”贵族在英格兰贵族阶层出现后的两个世纪才发展起来。尽管在高卢，国王继续被选举出来，这些国王并不比王国的其他领土亲王更强大，但是国王的象征权力得到教会的认可且基本没有受到普遍质疑，这种权力不足以阻止战士贵族向土地拥有贵族的转变。然而，在法国也出现了拥有土地的贵族阶层，对普遍权力拥有义务和权利，在南部却只是在十四世纪的过程中才形成。这一过程在区域不同的统治形式和地域不同的前提条件及结果的背景下实现。例如，一个不同的前提条件是，在许多地区几乎所有自由人都被描述为nobili，而在其他地区这种提升仅限于他们中更有权势的人。nobili的数量和他们拥有的土地平均规模因此而有所不同。有几个地区，许多nobili来自旧加洛林服务贵族的家系，而在其他地区——尤其是边境地区——十世纪的“强人”有特别有利的机会将自己变成拥有领主权力的城堡领主。最后，封建结构的分布和表述存在巨大差异。在某些时期，例如诺曼底的情况与英格兰非常相似，与南部的统治结构几乎没有什么共同之处。在法国北部，封建关系和效忠誓言（对封建领主的效忠誓言）的结合通常发展成为领主与那些仅临时住在他们家中的战士之间常规联系的主导形式。另一方面，南部长时间存在效忠誓言但没有封建关系 - 在某些地区对农民也是如此。只要个人关系因“亲切的馈赠”而得到加强，这通常与财政权力的物质参与有关。尽管亲王倾向于将封臣关系解释为要求封臣服从的关系，许多封臣却只将其视为维护和平的义务。哪种特定定义占据上风取决于实际的权力掌握情况。这种情况在领土亲王与国王之间的关系中得到了重现。南方的领主不必前往朝见国王，而法国北部的领土亲王通常确实会前去效忠。然而，就像他们自己的封臣一样，他们不愿意将效忠解释为服从关系的基础。只有当国王拥有军事和财政实力，将领土亲王的前领地作为封地在服从的条件下归还时，这种封建解释才成为现实。 因此，最初在“法国”，形成了许多不同的贵族阶层，但从十二世纪开始，一种超越地方差异的贵族观念开始占据主导地位。骑士理想普遍化了贵族阶层的行为规范和特权要求。骑士理想当然不是由神职人员发明的，但其传播与普遍化的教会统治实践密切相关：“上帝之和平”运动和十字军宣传。骑士理想将武装职业整合进基督教世界观。它结合了由教会认可的战争行为规范和非军事纪律形式，这些形式主要服务于courtoisie（骑士风度）的发展。无论这些规范是否标志着实际实践，骑士身份在十二世纪的过程中作为一个阶层确立了。它为其成员提供了特权的基础，如免税和在刑事诉讼中对其特权地位的特别考虑。这种骑士身份的社会重新评价在实践中已经建立的领主与农民之间的关系上改变甚微。然而，对骑士身份的要求组织了战士对所有非骑士平民的社会征服兴趣。 在“法国”对骑士理想的相对重要性，对于普遍领主观念的形成，与对王权神圣解释的相对更重要性相对应。尽管在英格兰，尽管那里也存在着关于王权的神话，但在王权行使对领主存在的再生产很重要的背景下，形成了与主人相对谦逊的王室封臣关系（这在叛乱中表现出来，当王权的实践与封臣的普遍利益相悖时），在中世纪的“法国”，尽管存在个别领主与国王之间的争端，贵族却没有发生叛乱。法国的国王不够强大，无法引发这样的叛乱。他们甚至不够强大，以至于贵族无法就普遍权力在王国内形成一个阶层。诚然，从1285年开始，爵位由皇家特许状文件记录，但直到十四世纪，“法国”的贵族仍主要以不同的领土贵族阶层或贵族集团的形式存在。尽管某些领土的亲王已经在当时成为国王的男爵，意味着皇家司法权力不仅扩展到这些亲王，也扩展到他们所有的封臣，但在整个王国范围内，贵族的普遍化主要是关于王权的神话，而不是关于封建或领主权的实践。 与英格兰的情况类似，晋升为贵族和获得领主身份也在中世纪的“法国”取决于一定生活方式的再生产，其物质前提来源于社会特权来源：战争、拥有领主权、婚姻，以及某种程度上的亲王服务（通常是非军事的）。但是，尽管在十三世纪的英格兰，为国王服务的可用性已经确立为gentillesse成员资格的标准，因此贵族一方面是一个有产阶层，另一方面也是相对于王权行使的阶层，在“法国”这个时期并不存在基于国王普遍统治的贵族定义，因此也没有普遍的贵族阶层。 城镇的自治和权力追求 英格兰没有与法国南部相当的城镇。在那里，城市组织——以教会统治的形式——和“城市”文化在古代消亡后幸存了下来。在中世纪，世俗贵族与教会的亲王在南法共享统治，处于或多或少具有竞争性的地位。但是，法国北部的情况也与英格兰大不相同。尽管英格兰的城镇居民当然可以获得特权，如收集交付给国王的税款的权利，但由于英格兰国王对土地和统治权的垄断，富裕城镇居民的权力策略操作空间相对受限。另一方面，在法国，国王授予城镇非常广泛的特权。通过授予城镇和修道院免除其原来的领主的豁免权，从而使它们直接受国王管辖，他们创造了财政、司法和军事要塞，可以用于针对贵族领土统治的策略。 在英格兰和法国，都发展出了马克斯·韦伯认为是欧洲封建制度的结构特征的城镇类型：城镇作为法人和城镇领先社会阶层对企业城镇特权的占有。但是，由于两个王国普遍王权的前提条件存在根本差异，从长远来看，也产生了城市市民与贵族之间的阶层冲突的不同结构前提条件。英格兰古制度长期存活的结构前提之一是城市市民权力相对于基于贵族土地垄断的地方统治行使的有限自治。城市市民权力无法扩张，在许多方面甚至开始下降，因为英格兰的王权普遍化不是与领土贵族统治竞争，而是与已经普遍化的王权相联系地确立了地方贵族统治。 2. 古制度出现的条件 在两个王国中，所有形式的个人统治开始被客观化，君主统治得到普遍化。这些发展的一般前提条件源于统治物质基础的扩张 - 耕地的扩张和贸易的扩展 - 以及武装占有的竞争结构。然而，学术文献中普遍存在的假设认为，普遍统治的扩张和客观化，通常描述为“国家”的发展，是货币化增加以及对农民起义进行必要防御的结果，这种假设是站不住脚的。尽管对个人统治的货币化需要一定程度的货币化，货币化的扩张在许多世纪仍是统治行使的结果。农民经常发现自己被迫出售生产的产品，即使这些产品是家庭必需的，以支付他们所需缴纳的税款和其他费用。在农民起义的镇压问题上，原因和结果也通常被混淆。尽管这样的起义定期产生了领主的共同行动，这些行动并没有构成任何权力拥有的永久普遍化。如果由于其他某些原因发生了这种情况，那么普遍化的权力手段就会被用来保障既定的统治。这丝毫没有表明任何因果关系。"},{"instruction":"请将“The basis for the expansion of generalised power was the organisation of armed appropriation and the securing of peace among the lords. The wars waged by the kings presupposed the de facto agreement or at least willing tol-eration of decisive sections of the nobility. In so far as nobles made use of their autonomous or delegated rulership competences and their political influence on a local and regional scale, they were able to raise the requisite financial means. Armed competition for rule between the lords was only made possible by their competence to call up armed men and procure horses, lodging and equipment. These preconditions for warfare formed at the same time the most important preconditions for the royal exercise of rule. Though kings were also supposed to establish justice and protect churches, so long as the conditions of their rule had not yet separated out from their immediate foundation in disposal over armed force, the actual effect of their legal practice remained tied to the direct connection of their power politics. The structural context of armed competition for rule applies to the entire 'world' of the European Middle Ages, but especially to England and 'France', in so far as the two royal houses waged a very long war against each other. In England, the changes in both landlord appropriation and armed appro-priation worked themselves out in connection with an already achieved generalisation of monarchical power. When the tenancies of lords became hereditable, the crown lost opportunities for the exercise of power, but this did not endanger the existence of the generalised power that was already established. Leaving aside particular cases and temporary divisions, noble rule did not develop in England in competition with monarchical rule. The practice of monarchical rule did however effect a certain generalisation of rul-ing interests. It was in this way that regular conditions arose both for the deployment of royal feudal power, as well as for the practice of generalised judicial, fiscal and military power. By calling parliaments - at least when they needed to raise taxes - kings took account of the conditions for the exercise of their rule. Two of the structural changes that mark the transition from feudalism to the ancien régime in England should be emphasised in respect to the question of the structural preconditions for the different political forms in which bourgeois state power developed. First, personal obligations founded on the feudal rule of the king were from the thirteenth century on increasingly - though not completely - transformed into fiscal tenancy charges. From this time on, if the kings wanted to make use of the armed force of their nobles, they made contracts with them. In the organisation of armed force, therefore, these objec-tified structures were combined with the traditions of vassalage and the royal myth. The second important feature for the emergence of the English ancien régime in this respect was the constitution of two distinct noble estates. The constitution of the English high nobility - a process of the fourteenth century - was the result of a successful struggle by powerful barons for particular privileges. They acquired a hereditary right to be called to parliaments, and successfully demanded that Parliament should henceforth not simply advise the king, but also function as a judicial instance. From the fourteenth century on, membership of the peerage became formalised, new titles arising along with an internal hierarchy within the high nobility. The privileges of the peerage and the manner of their inheritance were thereby institutionalised. Royal favour could expand the power and possessions of individual nobles, and there were, of course, de facto distinctions in their disposal over means of force, yet the practice of generalised power united and limited the legally fixed privileges of English peers. The lower nobility in England was on the one hand the result of a decline. With the formalising of the privileges of powerful barons, the remaining members of the knightly estates were in a sense institutionally reduced to a lower social rank. At the same time, however, the rise of the lower nobility in England was also the result of a social advance. Whilst the connection of the knightly orders to military practice in England already began to dissolve in the thirteenth century, this social group was consolidated by the crown's making use of the land-holding nobles for its local exercise of rule. In the Commons, which arose as an institution for the formulation of petitions after the peers had appropriated judicial competences for their assembly in Parliament, local demands on the practice of royal rule were formulated and to some degree also generalised. It was significant for the development of the ancien régime in England that the lower nobility controlled the local exercise of royal office power and admission to ‘gentility', also that local power of office did not offer any hold on generalised appropriation. The fact that membership of the nobility did not determine the acquisition of fiscal privileges, but rather admission to the (unpaid) service of the king, contributed to the fact that within the ruling estates, the interest in the limita-tion of royal fiscal power was repeatedly generalised. Thus, though the English kings were unusually strong, comparatively more so than the French, this was only when they acted in far-reaching agreement with the peerage and the gentry. Within the gentry, lordly status was largely reproduced via economic exploitation of the land monopoly. In the situation of intensified competition for labour of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, many who had only little judicial power or armed force at their disposal were forced to agree to the reduction or abolition of their manorial power competences. In this way, forms of appropriation in a context of personal rule were transformed into appropriation on the basis of disposal over means of production. As against the situation in England, the emergence of the ancien régime in 'France' did not amount to the refoundation of an already generalised monar-chical power in the generalised interest of the nobility, but essentially only to the expansion of monarchical rule. The structural preconditions of this process resulted from the economic development of the crown lands, from the support that the crown could obtain from towns and monasteries as a peacekeeping and privilege-granting instance, as well as from the difficulties experienced in reproducing local and territorial rule. This last arose from crises in seigneurial appropriation, increasing costs for the reproduction of lordly existence, and structural changes in armed force. The kings integrated their possession of territorial rule by waging war against the holders of territorial and local rule, or offering them pensions - quite commonly both one and the other. Special ties were secured by marriage contracts. This generalisation of royal power was regulated by concepts and symbols of feudal lordship, which literally means that royal feudal lordship was only realised in 'France' when the crown was in a position to purchase important vassals. The dominant form of expansion of monarchical power was the material connection of holders of territorial power to the crown, a circumstance that runs diametrically counter to the view of feudal sovereignty that is still often reproduced in history books today: it was on the basis of payments that princes were ready to transfer their previously autonomous possession of ruling power to the king, receiving it back from him as a fief. In the regions that thus fell to its sway, the crown established its judicial power as an instance of appeal. Two characteristics of this process of generalisation are particularly signifi-cant in the present comparative study. First of all, the integration of existing territorial and local rule did not effect any unification: different legal forms and contents remained in being, just as did different forms of seigneurial rule and noble privilege. For all that, the generalisation of monarchical power did constitute a 'French' nobility, i.e. a privileged estate of the kingdom as a whole. With the development of the royal power of taxation, the privileged position of the nobility in this respect became its common characteristic. Secondly, the king's renunciation of taxing the nobles created the material basis for the existence of generalised monarchical power. Since the exercise of this power in ‘France' scarcely developed any unitary forms, it also hardly provoked any unification of interests. Estate assemblies failed to emerge for a long time, not because of the crown's successful resistance to them, but rather as a function of the disinterest of the provinces and towns. For the territorially and locally dominant families entertained justified hopes of acquiring privileges by way of clever diplomacy. As against the English case, therefore, there was no regu- larisation of royal fiscal power in ‘France', but a system of negotiated taxation rather developed. Royal taxation consisted of a system of bilateral diplomatic agreements.”翻译为中文","output":"普遍权力扩张的基础是武装征用的组织和在领主之间确保和平。国王发动的战争预设了贵族决定性阶层的事实上的同意或至少愿意容忍。因为贵族利用了他们自主或委托的统治能力和在地方及区域层面的政治影响力，他们能够筹集所需的财政手段。领主之间争夺统治的武装竞争只有通过他们召集武装人员、获取马匹、住宿和装备的能力才成为可能。这些战争的前提条件同时也是国王行使统治权的最重要前提条件。尽管国王还应建立正义和保护教堂，但只要他们的统治条件尚未从对武装力量的处置的直接基础中分离出来，他们的法律实践的实际效果仍与他们的权力政治的直接联系有关。争夺统治的武装竞争的结构背景适用于整个欧洲中世纪的“世界”，但特别是对英格兰和“法国”，因为这两个王室之间进行了一场非常长期的战争。 在英格兰，地主占有和武装占有的变化是与已经实现的君主权力的普遍化联系在一起的。当领主的封地变成可以继承时，国王失去了行使权力的机会，但这并没有危及已经建立的普遍权力的存在。撇开特殊情况和暂时分裂不谈，贵族统治在英格兰没有与君主统治竞争而发展。然而，君主统治的实践确实促成了统治利益的某种普遍化。这样，既为王室封建权力的部署，也为普遍法律、财政和军事权力的实践创造了常规条件。通过召集议会 - 至少在需要筹集税收时 - 国王考虑到了行使其统治权力的条件。 关于资产阶级国家权力发展的不同政治形式的结构前提条件这一问题，应强调英格兰从封建制向古制度过渡标志的两个结构变化。首先，基于国王封建统治的个人义务从十三世纪开始越来越多地（尽管不是完全地）转变为财政租赁责任。从那时起，如果国王想利用他们的贵族武装力量，他们会与贵族签订合同。因此，在武装力量的组织中，这些客观化结构与封臣传统和王室神话相结合。对于英格兰古制度出现的第二个重要特征是两个不同的贵族阶层的构成。英格兰高贵族的构成——一个十四世纪的过程——是强大男爵为了特定特权而进行成功斗争的结果。他们获得了被召集到议会的世袭权，并成功要求议会此后不仅仅是向国王提供建议，还应作为一个司法实体。从十四世纪开始，贵族成员资格变得正式化，出现了新的头衔以及高贵族内部的等级制度。贵族特权及其继承方式因此得到制度化。国王的恩宠可以扩大个别贵族的权力和财产，当然，在武装力量的处置上存在事实上的区别，但普遍权力的实践统一并限制了英格兰贵族法定特权。 英格兰的下层贵族一方面是衰落的结果。随着强大男爵的特权正式化，骑士阶层的其余成员在某种意义上被机构性地降低到了较低的社会等级。然而，同样，英格兰下层贵族的崛起也是社会进步的结果。尽管骑士团与军事实践的联系在十三世纪的英格兰已开始解散，但这一社会群体通过王室利用拥有土地的贵族进行地方统治的实践而巩固。在作为提案制定机构而产生的下议院中，对王权实践的地方要求得到了制定并在一定程度上也得到了普遍化。对于英格兰古制度的发展来说，下层贵族控制了地方王室职权和通往“gentility”的入口很有意义，同时地方官职权力并未提供对普遍占有的任何把握。 贵族成员资格并未决定财政特权的获得，而是取决于赢得（无报酬的）为国王服务的机会，这促成了统治阶层内部对限制国王财政权力的兴趣反复被普遍化。因此，尽管英格兰国王异常强大，相对于法国更为如此，但这只是在他们与贵族和乡绅广泛达成一致时才成立。 在乡绅内部，领主地位主要通过对土地垄断的经济剥削来再生产。在十四和十五世纪劳动竞争加剧的情况下，许多只拥有少量司法权力或武装力量的人被迫同意减少或废除他们的领地统治能力。这样，基于对生产资料处置权的占有，在个人统治背景下的占有形式转变为基于对生产资料处置权的占有。 与英格兰情况相反，“法国”古制度的出现并不意味着在贵族的普遍兴趣中重新建立已经普遍化的君主权力，而基本上只是君主统治的扩张。这一过程的结构前提条件源于王室领地的经济发展，王室能够作为维护和平和授予特权的实体从城镇和修道院获得的支持，以及在再生产地方和领土统治方面遇到的困难。后者源于领主占有危机、维持领主生活成本的增加和武装力量结构的变化。国王通过对领土和地方统治者发动战争或提供养老金（相当普遍地两者兼而有之）来整合其领土统治的占有。通过婚姻合同确保了特殊关系。王权的普遍化通过对领土权力持有者与王室的物质联系进行调节，这一事实与历史书上仍常复制的封建主权观完全相反：正是基于支付，亲王们准备将他们先前自主拥有的统治权力转让给国王，作为封地从他处收回。在因此而归属于其统治的地区，王室将其司法权力作为上诉实体确立。 这一普遍化过程的两个特点在本次比较研究中特别重要。首先，现有的领土和地方统治的整合并未实现任何统一：不同的法律形式和内容保持不变，领主统治和贵族特权的不同形式也是如此。尽管如此，君主权力的普遍化确实构成了一个“法国”贵族，即整个王国的特权阶层。随着王权征税力的发展，贵族在这方面的特权地位成为其共同特征。其次，国王放弃对贵族征税为普遍化的君主权力的存在创造了物质基础。由于在“法国”，这种权力的行使几乎没有发展出任何统一形式，它也几乎没有引起任何利益的统一。由于省份和城镇的不感兴趣，贵族大会长时间未能出现，这不是因为王室成功地抵制它们，而是作为省份和城镇不感兴趣的结果。对于领土和地方占主导地位的家族而言，通过巧妙的外交获得特权的希望是有根据的。因此，与英格兰情况相反，在“法国”没有对王室财政权力进行常规化，而是发展出了一个协商税收的体系。王室税收由双边外交协议组成的系统所构成。"},{"instruction":"请将“In each of the kingdoms under investigation here, noble rule was both lim-ited and sanctioned by royal rule, in other words it existed from then on in the form of privilege. But the management of privileges, which in both kingdoms comprised the basis of generalised monarchical power under the ancien régime, was subject right from the start, and throughout the whole existence of the ancien régime, to structurally different conditions. Whilst in ‘France' the crown was confronted by many different privileges, basically in a competitive situation with one another, the English crown had to act in a context of partially generalised interests of the holders of privilege. If they were successful in this, English kings, despite having no ‘apparatus' at their disposal with members who were materially dependent on them, were able to govern the land, whereas the French crown, despite having appropriated de facto the prerogative of taxation and with it the possibility of autonomous organisation of armed force, remained in a situation of regulated diplomatic relations vis- à-vis the particular territorial and local ruling powers. 3. Contradictory development of the ancien régime Structural crises under the ancien régime were crises in the system of rule. They had a material basis in structural changes in the conditions of appropriation, but a crisis of landlordship did not in all circumstances find expression in a crisis of the system of rule. Crises that put in question the personal structure of rule resulted far more commonly from struggles for position within the ruling estates. Class-type contradictions led to crises of reproduction, and provoked strategies of crisis management and structural changes which in turn endangered - or else improved - the position of the appropriators. To this extent, conflicts between lords and peasants, or between masters and journeymen, could be the cause of such crises of rule. If social conflicts of this kind led to a regularisation or a general formalisation of ruling practice, they also influenced a change in the forms of rule. The central dynamic of change in the generalised structures of rule under the ancien régime, however, resulted from competition among the possessors of personal power competences, and from the influential demand of rising social forces who wanted either to participate in such possession, or else to curtail it. The structural preconditions for conflict over the distribution and scope of personal rule were different in the two kingdoms. Their specific character depended on whether material threats to the lords' existence were transformed into a crisis of the system of rule, or could be negotiated without any fundamental shock. In this respect, the following structural features were decisive: the extent and forms of centralised appropriation, the extent and material basis of the political strength of the high nobility, along with the structural relationship between this strength and the generalised interests of the lower nobility, and the conditions of individual advance into the noble estate along with the correspondence between estate hierarchy and distribu-tion of wealth. The emphasis on structural differences between the forms of estate rule in England and France stands in contradiction with the tendency in English historiography, reinforced in recent years, to overestimate the common char-acter of English nobility and its continental counterparts. It is in this connec-tion that historians maintain the noble character of the gentry, and revise the long-established notion that access to the English nobility was more open than was the case in France. Reference is also made to the fact that the privileges of the high nobility in England were not so extensive and provocative as those of the continental noble estates, even if they should by no means be seen as incidental. None of these contentions is contested here. But they simply justify the subsuming of both kingdoms under the concept of ancien régime. And it is only possible to proceed in this way if the gentry are not seen - in a temporarily influential view - as bearers of a ‘bourgeois revolution' directed against the king and ‘feudalism' (aristocracy), and the revolutions of the seventeenth century are not interpreted as the end of the ancien régime in England. Rejection of this interpretation requires an emphasis on structural commonalities; the question of the structural causes for the very different development of the ancien régime in France and England, however, demands an analysis of their differences. Extent and structure of centralised appropriation Forceful efforts were made in both kingdoms to increase the extent of cen-tralised appropriation. The most important occasions for this tendency arose from efforts to finance military projects and dynastic power politics. What is particularly significant in the present connection is the fiscally provoked extension of the permanence of offices. This could lead to financial burdens on the crown, if the payment of salaries was envisaged. In so far as the crown sold offices, the expansion of 'state' power served to increase the 'state's' finances. Efforts to extend the possession of office, and hence - in one form or another - private appropriation by way of centralised power, proceeded for the most part from the government. By offering profitable office power, the crown was able to tie to itself those nobles who, as a result of difficulties of appropriation in the seigneurial sphere, or rising costs in the expenses pertaining to their lordly status, sought new sources of income. To the extent that lucrative offices whose actual exercise was either perfunctory or could be performed by substitutes achieved the material integration of the high nobility into monarchical rule, they offered an opportunity in the short term to counter threats to the established system of rule. In so far as possession of a particular office endowed or confirmed a social rank, the crown at the same time established and defended its competence to authoritatively define the social hierarchy. This in turn had the consequence that hopes of social advance could be satisfied, and a further cause of crisis in the system of rule 'resolved', by status-enhancing private participation in centralised power. Yet strategies of this kind came up against structural limits. Extraction by way of centralised power competence could certainly be increased by main force, but in the long term such strategies competed with demands for the material or even biological reproduction of the labouring population, and also with other private appropriation. At the same time, the expansion of offices led to a competition between office-holders for sources of income, expressed in violent conflicts over jurisdiction, while the profitability of offices fell and with it at least their material, if not necessarily their social, attractiveness. In France, the political and fiscal opportunities for granting office power were used right to the limit. This was possible because the costs that these offices involved for the government were financed by taxes that fell chiefly on the peasants, besides raising the government debt and to this extent also the prospects for 'state' creditors to draw more interest. As against the situation in England, there was no social group in France that was in a position to impose a restriction on offices. The crown consequently used the fiscal possibilities of selling office power and the 'taxation' from office property. Although property in office power - which, with few exceptions, became inheritable in the seventeenth century - could, in certain circumstances, prove a less profitable investment in strictly material terms, the demand persisted, since office property promised direct or future access to the noblesse de robe. Though the unity of the noble estate had been maintained in France until the end of the sixteenth century, and ennoblement along with gradual de facto advance had meant the confirmation by the ruling power of a single nobility, the increase in office nobility effected a regular separation between the noblesse d'épée and the noblesse de robe. Since, at the same time, the possibility of advance by gradual integration into already established strata of the nobility was abolished - or at least made immensely more difficult -, investment in office property developed into a structural feature of strategies for family advance. By the creation of ever new offices, the crown did not so much improve the effectiveness of its 'apparatus' as promote, on the contrary, a competition for competences and the tendency of office-holders to make use of the means of generalised power to secure their own profit. In this sense, the royal 'admin-istration' stood in a certain contradiction to the expansion of material repro-duction. In view of this structural importance of office property, particular development measures that were decreed and implemented by office-holders (most commonly, by the intendants) were hardly significant. In England, too, there were regular sinecures. Yet the fact that the nobility was not fiscally privileged, and the generalisation of gentry interests in Par-liament - along with the possibility of successful resistance to costly practices of government - meant that the crown, if it wanted to provide nobles with incomes, had in general to resort to involving them in the 'administration' of its feudal appropriation power. The administrators of the 'central' government received regular salaries, along with the incumbents of court offices. Local government, on the other hand, was largely carried out by representatives of the local nobility and - after the Reformation - clergy of the Church of England, who did not receive payment from the crown.”翻译为中文","output":"在这里研究的每一个王国中，贵族统治既受到了王权的限制也得到了认可，换句话说，它从那时起以特权的形式存在。但是，在古制度下，这两个王国的普遍化君主权力的基础上的特权管理，从一开始就受到结构性不同条件的影响，并贯穿古制度的整个存在期。在“法国”，王权面对许多不同的特权，基本上处于彼此竞争的情况，而英格兰王权则需要在部分普遍化的特权持有者利益的背景下行动。如果他们在此成功，尽管没有拥有物质依赖于他们的成员的“机构”，英格兰国王仍能够治理这片土地，而法国王室，尽管实际上占有了税收特权以及武装力量自主组织的可能性，仍处于与特定领土和地方统治力量之间受规范的外交关系中。 # 3. 古制度的矛盾发展 古制度下的结构性危机是统治系统的危机。它们在物质上基于占有条件的结构性变化，但地主统治的危机并不总是表现为统治系统的危机。挑战统治个人结构的危机更常见于统治阶层内部的地位斗争。类似阶级的矛盾导致了再生产的危机，并引发了危机管理策略和结构变化，这反过来又危及或改善了占有者的地位。在这种程度上，领主与农民之间或主人与学徒之间的冲突可能是这种统治危机的原因。如果这类社会冲突导致统治实践的规范化或普遍正式化，它们也影响了统治形式的变化。然而，古制度下普遍统治结构变化的中心动力，来自于个人权力能力持有者之间的竞争，以及希望参与这种占有或想要削减它的上升社会力量的有影响力的需求。 关于个人统治的分配和范围的冲突的结构性前提条件在两个王国中是不同的。它们的特定性质取决于领主存在的物质威胁是否转变为统治系统的危机，或者能否在没有根本性冲击的情况下进行谈判。在这方面，以下结构特征是决定性的：集中占有的范围和形式、高贵族政治力量的范围和物质基础，以及这种力量与下层贵族普遍利益之间的结构关系，以及个人晋升至贵族阶层的条件以及贵族等级与财富分配之间的对应关系。 强调英格兰和法国贵族制度形式之间的结构性差异与近年来英国史学界的趋势相矛盾，这种趋势高估了英格兰贵族与其大陆对应物的共同特性。在这方面，历史学家们坚持乡绅的贵族特性，并修正了英格兰贵族比法国更开放的长期观念。他们还提到，英格兰高贵族的特权并不像大陆贵族阶层那样广泛和挑衅性，即使它们绝不应被视为偶然。这些论点在这里并未受到质疑。但它们仅仅证明了将两个王国都归入古制度概念是合理的。只有当乡绅不被视为——在一种暂时有影响的观点中——针对国王和“封建制”（贵族统治）的“资产阶级革命”的承担者，且十七世纪的革命不被解释为英格兰古制度的结束时，才有可能这样做。排除这种解释需要强调结构性的共性；然而，针对古制度在法国和英格兰发展差异很大的结构性原因的问题，则需要对它们的差异进行分析。 # 集中占有的范围和结构 两个王国都在努力增加集中占有的范围。这一趋势最重要的契机来自于资助军事项目和王朝权力政治的努力。特别重要的是，财政诱因引发的办公室永久性扩展。这可能给王室带来财政负担，如果预期支付薪水的话。只要王室出售官职，'国家'权力的扩大就能增加'国家'的财政收入。 努力扩大官职占有，从而以某种形式通过集中权力进行私人占有，大部分来自政府。通过提供有利可图的官职权力，王室能够将那些由于在领主领域的占有困难或地位相关费用上升而寻求新收入来源的贵族吸引到自己这边。在有利可图的官职实际履行要么形同虚设要么可以由替代者执行的情况下，实现高贵族物质融入君主统治，它们在短期内提供了应对建立统治系统威胁的机会。 只要某个特定官职的占有赋予或确认了社会等级，王室同时确立并捍卫了其权威性定义社会等级的能力。这反过来又导致社会晋升的希望可以通过提升地位的私人参与集中权力得到满足，从而“解决”了统治系统危机的另一个原因。然而，这类策略遇到了结构性限制。通过集中权力能力的摄取确实可以通过武力增加，但从长期来看，这类策略与劳动人口的物质甚至生物学再生产的需求竞争，也与其他私人占有竞争。同时，官职的扩展导致官员之间就收入来源的竞争，表现为对管辖权的暴力冲突，而官职的盈利性下降，至少在物质上（如果不是在社会上），降低了它们的吸引力。 在法国，政治和财政上用于授予官职权力的机会被充分利用。这是可能的，因为这些官职为政府带来的成本是通过主要落在农民身上的税收、增加政府债务来资助的，从这个角度也增加了'国家'债权人获取更多利息的前景。与英格兰情况不同的是，法国没有社会群体能够对官职施加限制。因此，王室充分利用了出售官职权力的财政可能性以及从官职财产中'征税'。尽管官职权力的财产——在十七世纪几乎没有例外地成为可继承的——在严格物质意义上可能证明是一项不太有利可图的投资，但需求仍然存在，因为官职财产承诺了直接或将来进入便衣贵族之门。尽管到十六世纪末，贵族的统一性在法国得以维持，并且晋爵连同逐步事实上的晋升意味着统治权力对单一贵族的确认，但官职贵族的增加引起了剑贵族和便衣贵族之间的明确分离。由于同时，通过逐步融入已确立的贵族阶层的晋升机会被废除——或至少大大增加了难度——官职财产的投资成为家族晋升战略的结构性特征。 通过不断创设新的官职，王室并没有真正提高其'机构'的效能，反而促进了官员之间的竞争和官员利用普遍权力手段来确保自身利益的倾向。从这个意义上讲，皇家'行政机关'在某种程度上与物质再生产的扩张形成了矛盾。鉴于官职财产的这一结构性重要性，官员（最常见的是总督）颁布和实施的特定发展措施几乎无关紧要。 在英格兰，也存在常规的闲职。然而，由于贵族没有财政特权，贵族在议会中的普遍利益得到普遍化——以及成功抵制政府成本高昂做法的可能性——意味着王室如果想为贵族提供收入，通常不得不让他们参与其封建征用权力的'管理'。'中央'政府的管理者和宫廷官员得到定期薪水。另一方面，地方政府主要由当地贵族代表和——在宗教改革后——英格兰教会的神职人员执行，他们未从王室获得报酬。"},{"instruction":"How many ways are there to pack 24 different books into 8 boxes with 3 books each if (a) all 8 boxes are sent to different addresses?

Since the boxes are sent to different addresses, each box is distinct. 1. Choose 3 books out of 24 for the first box: There are ( binom{24}{3} ) ways. 2. Choose 3 books out of the remaining 21 for the second box: There are ( binom{21}{3} ) ways. 3. Continue doing this until you fill the 8th box with the last 3 books: The final step would involve ( binom{3}{3} ) ways. Given that these steps are independent, we multiply the number of ways together. The total number of ways is the product of all these binomial coefficients, resulting in: [ binom{24}{3} times binom{21}{3} times binom{18}{3} times binom{15}{3} times binom{12}{3} times binom{9}{3} times binom{6}{3} times binom{3}{3} ] [ = frac{24!}{3! , 21!} times frac{21!}{3! , 18!} times frac{18!}{3! , 15!} times frac{15!}{3! , 12!} times frac{12!}{3! , 9!} times frac{9!}{3! , 6!} times frac{6!}{3! , 3!} times frac{3!}{3! , 0!} ] [ = frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] Since all boxes go to different addresses, considering each box as distinct is valid, and the above calculation directly gives us the total number of ways. # (b) All 8 boxes are sent to the same address When all boxes are sent to the same address, the boxes are considered identical since it doesn't matter which books go into which box as long as they are grouped in threes. The number of ways to divide 24 books into groups of 3 (without regard to the order of the groups) is given by dividing the previous result by the number of ways to arrange the 8 boxes (since they are now considered identical), which is (8!). So, the calculation adjusts to: [ frac{frac{24!}{(3!)^8}}{8!} ] # (c) 4 of the boxes are shipped to four different addresses while 4 are left to be addressed later In this scenario, we have a mix; 4 boxes are considered distinct, and the other 4 are identical. First, select and pack books into the 8 boxes using the same initial calculation as in part (a). But, since only half of the boxes are distinct due to their different destinations, and the other half are identical, we need to adjust our calculation. For the 4 boxes that are considered identical, we should divide by (4!) to correct for counting each permutation of these boxes as unique when they are not: [ frac{frac{24!}{(3!)^8}}{4!} ] However, this division corrects only for the identical nature of one subset of the boxes. It does not fully represent the situation since we are considering 4 boxes distinct (going to different addresses) and the other 4 as identical. The initial division treats 4 of the boxes as identical, but since we're dividing by (4!) instead of (8!) used in the identical case, it automatically accounts for the situation where 4 boxes are distinct (by not overcorrecting for these being considered in different sequences). To conclude: - **(a)** The expression ( frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ) directly gives the number of ways to pack and send the boxes to different addresses. - **(b)** Adjusted by (8!) to account for identical boxes: ( frac{frac{24!}{(3!)^8}}{8!} ). - **©** Adjusted by (4!) for the mix of distinct and identical boxes: ( frac{frac{24!}{(3!)^8}}{4!} ).

In part ©, we’re asked to pack 24 books into 8 boxes with 3 books each, where 4 of these boxes are sent to four different addresses, and the other 4 are left to be addressed later, implying these latter 4 are considered identical for our purposes since their destination is not specified. The initial calculation provided was an attempt to adjust for the distinctness and identical nature of the boxes by dividing by the factorial of the number of identical boxes. However, this approach might have been misleading or not fully explained. Let's re-examine and correct the solution for part © step by step. # Original Task You have 24 books to be packed into 8 boxes, with 3 books in each box. # © Calculation Revised - First, regardless of address, you’re arranging 24 books in sets of 3 books into 8 boxes. This is akin to the previous case without considering the addresses, where the major step is figuring out how to distribute the books. - Then, we must account for the difference in addressing the boxes. Specifically, 4 boxes have distinct addresses (making them distinct), and 4 do not have specified addresses (making them identical in terms of how we consider permutations). Given this, the detailed step for distinct addressing isn't necessary for calculating the book packing itself but for organizing how we perceive the distinction or identical nature of the boxes based on the provided problem conditions. We actually mix principles between permutations (for arranging items where order matters) and combinations (where order does not matter). The simple method previously mentioned: [ text{Total arrangements for 8 distinct boxes} = frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] accounts for packing books into 8 distinct boxes, considering each as going to a unique address. Yet, for part ©, sub-dividing that into 4 boxes being distinct and 4 being identical wasn't directly addressed accurately in the given context. For part ©, my initial explanation might have oversimplified or improperly applied the handling of identical vs. distinct boxes. The crux of this specific scenario doesn't cleanly fit into a simple division by a factorial of identical elements formula because the distinction doesn't arise from how the books are packed into the boxes but from how the boxes are treated post-packing due to their destination. A more accurate reevaluation for © would essentially reiterate the importance of the arrangement of books into boxes as the primary concern. The subsequent distinction or identical nature of boxes more so affects how we might consider the grouping or the addressing rather than the packing of books itself. Thus, the core calculation of how to pack the books stays as given, with the additional consideration of addressing not altering the combinatorial packing but influencing our consideration of box distinction which was not numerically recalculated for in © as it should have been due to a reasoning error on my part. The differentiation between distinct and identical boxes in terms of addressing, given all books are initially packed, leans into how we might differentiate or not differentiate the second group of 4 boxes, affecting arrangements if we were focusing on box permutation rather than book packing. For ©, assuming the consideration of distinct and identical boxes was directly relevant to packing (which in this context, was misunderstood), the distinguishing approach would be akin to considering permutations post-packing for addressing, which wasn't the primary goal given. Without a specific need to recalculate based on addressing post-packing, the calculation provided might have misled from focusing on the initial question’s scope concerning book packing directly.

Thank you","output":"Email #4, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Dplt. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Special Agent Chandler Marina, and the dedicated team, Thank you for your swift response and the detailed insights provided regarding the recovery and restitution process of the funds. It is immensely reassuring to know the lengths to which your team has gone to secure justice for those of us caught in the unfortunate web of scams. The collaborative effort between American and Commonwealth nations' agents and local institutions in Nigeria, particularly with the involvement of two major banks and Citi Bank for the electronic wire transfer, highlights the robustness of the strategy in place to combat these fraudulent activities. It instills a sense of confidence in the transparency and security of the process. The requirement for a Payment Authorization document from the court is understood as a necessary step to legally establish my claim to the funds. The fee of 450 for the processing of such critical documents appears to be a small price to pay for the reassurance and legality it provides in the grand scheme of things. However, I do have a few additional queries before proceeding: 1. Could you provide more details on the payment process for the 450 fee? Given the nature of our engagement and the emphasis on security, I would like to ensure that the method of payment aligns with the highest standards of safety and traceability. 2. Will there be a direct point of contact at Citi Bank or within the involved government agencies who will oversee the transfer and ensure that all documents are processed correctly? It would be immensely helpful to have a specific individual to liaise with for updates or any queries that may arise during the process. 3. In terms of timeline, once the fee is paid, and the Payment Authorization document is processed, how long typically does it take for the funds to be transferred? Understanding the expected duration will help in planning accordingly. 4. For records and personal assurance, would it be possible to receive a brief profile or verification of identity for the key individuals involved in this process? While I completely trust the legitimacy of this operation, having such information would provide additional peace of mind. Rest assured, I am poised to proceed with the payment of the 450 fee upon clarification of these points, to facilitate the smooth and secure transfer of the recovered funds. Your commitment to justice and the recuperation of assets lost to scammers is not only commendable but provides a beacon of hope for many who have been disillusioned by their experiences. Thank you once again for your diligence, and I look forward to your guidance on the aforementioned queries.

(b) all 8 boxes are sent to the same address? © 4 of the boxes are shipped to four different addresses while 4 are left to be addressed later?","output":"To solve this problem, we have to understand the combinations and permutations aspect as it involves arranging 24 different books into boxes in a specific way. Firstly, we're focusing on part (c) of the problem statement, which specifies that 4 of the boxes are shipped to four different addresses, while the remaining 4 are left to be addressed later. Here's how you can break it down: 1. We'll first focus on how to distribute the 24 books among the 8 boxes, each holding 3 books. Since the books are distinct, the number of ways to distribute them is determined by how you can divide 24 items into groups of 3. - The first step involves selecting 3 books out of the 24 to go into the first box, which can be done in (binom{24}{3}) ways. - For the next box, we choose 3 out of the remaining 21 books, which can be done in (binom{21}{3}) ways, and so on until we fill all 8 boxes. 2. This procedure gives us a product of selections: [ binom{24}{3} cdot binom{21}{3} cdot binom{18}{3} cdot binom{15}{3} cdot binom{12}{3} cdot binom{9}{3} cdot binom{6}{3} cdot binom{3}{3} ] Given that (binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}), the expression simplifies using the factorial notation. However, when calculating such a product of binomials where each binomial represents the number of ways to choose (k) items from a set of (n) that decreases by (k) each time, the result is equivalent to calculating (frac{24!}{(3!)^8}), because every group of 3 books does not matter in which order they’re boxed (hence we divide by (3!) for each of the 8 groups). 3. Now, considering the additional condition that 4 of these boxes are shipped to four different addresses, while 4 are left undressed. For the 4 specific boxes that are addressed, they can be assigned to the 4 different addresses in (4!) different ways. So, the complete calculation would first involve the way we pack the books and then how we ship 4 of those boxes. But the shipping detail only affects the 4 addressed boxes. Since the boxes are identical except for the destination addresses, we only consider those permutations for the subset of boxes being addressed: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} cdot 4! ] This gives us the total number of ways to pack and address 24 books into 8 boxes under the given constraints. So, to find the exact number from the expression: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8 cdot 4!} ] However, note that I previously included (4!) in the calculation indicating the arrangement of boxes to different addresses. The correction should be that we don't further multiply by (4!) because we're focusing only on the permutation of the books into boxes under the specific restrictions provided. The addressing of 4 doesn't come with multiple arrangements beyond the packing; the addresses don't alter the packing distribution, so the final formula simplifies to just the arrangement of books, given the mistake in adding the final (4!) step: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] This is the correct representation for the ways to pack the 24 books into 8 boxes without considering additional orderings for addressing beyond what's specified in the particular part (c) question. I mistakenly added an extra calculation step for addressing that isn't needed here. The key focus for part (c) is on how the books are distributed among the boxes under the stipulated condition."},{"instruction":"answer is this? How many ways are there to pack 24 different books into 8 boxes with 3 books each if (a) all 8 boxes are sent to different addresses? (b) all 8 boxes are sent to the same address? © 4 of the boxes are shipped to four different addresses while 4 are left to be addressed later?","output":"Apologies for any confusion in my previous response. Let's provide a clear, direct answer to part (c) of your question based on a step-by-step calculation without the extra commentary. For part (c)—where 4 of the boxes are shipped to four different addresses while 4 are left to be addressed later—the solution involves: 1. **Packing 24 different books into 8 boxes with 3 books each.** The first step is to determine how to distribute the 24 books across these 8 boxes. Since each box has 3 books and the books are distinct, we use combinations to account for the different ways we can select books for each box. As explained earlier, the overall number of ways to arrange the 24 books into 8 boxes of 3 books each (without considering the addresses yet) is calculated by: [ text{Ways to pack} = frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] 2. **Addressing 4 specific boxes with differentiation.** Since 4 of these boxes are to be shipped to different addresses, we care about which box goes where, but this aspect has already been inadvertently considered in the initial calculation where boxes are treated distinctly based on their content arrangement. Thus, at this stage, considering additional permutations for the specific addressing of 4 boxes doesn't alter the initial calculation because the differentiation comes from the contents rather than the address assignment for this context. Thus, the total number of ways to pack 24 different books into 8 boxes under the condition (c) is solely given by: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] This number represents the different combinations to pack the books without further permutation for addressing, as I initially indicated incorrectly. To calculate the exact number: - **Computing (24!):** This is the factorial of 24, which is the product of all positive integers up to 24. - **Computing (3!):** This is simply (3 times 2 times 1 = 6). - **Substituting in the equation gives:** [ frac{24!}{(6^8)} ] When you calculate (24!), it's a large number, and (6^8 = 1679616). For clarity and to avoid computational error in textual representation, it's best to use a calculator for direct computation at this point. The intention was to correct the oversight and provide clarity on how to approach the permutation and combination for packing and addressing under part (c)'s specifications accurately."},{"instruction":"How many ways are there to pack 24 different books into 8 boxes with 3 books each if (a) 4 of the boxes are shipped to four different addresses while 4 are left to be addressed later?","output":"To solve this, we can break it down into steps, focusing on the constraints given: 1. **Packing 24 different books into 8 boxes with 3 books each:** Since there are 24 different books to be packed into 8 boxes, each with 3 books, this is basically a question of how to distribute 24 unique items into groups of 3. Firstly, we choose 3 books to go into the first box, 3 out of the remaining 21 for the second box, and so on, until all books are packed. The number of ways to do this is given by the multinomial coefficient, which in this case simplifies to the combination of 24 books taken 3 at a time, then 21 taken 3 at a time, until we are choosing the last 3 books out of 3. The formula for combinations is (C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}), and because we're dividing by the factorial of the number of groups (since the order of selection does not matter for the boxes), this further simplifies to the division by (8!), the factorial of the number of boxes, accounting for the indistinguishability of the boxes at this step. This gives us: [ frac{24!}{3!^{8} times 8!} ] 2. **Considering that 4 of these boxes have to be shipped to different addresses and 4 are left unaddressed:** For this part, after the books have been packed into 8 boxes, we know that 4 specific boxes are picked to be shipped to 4 different addresses. The number of ways of choosing 4 boxes out of 8 to be shipped is (C(8, 4) = frac{8!}{4!4!}). However, since each of these four boxes goes to a different address, we must also consider the permutations of these 4 chosen boxes as they are distinct based on their shipping destinations. The number of ways to arrange 4 items is (4!). So, the step of choosing and shipping 4 out of the 8 packed boxes to distinct addresses involves, in fact, (C(8, 4) times 4!) operations. Considering the result from step 2 doesn't require an additional multiplication by (4!) because I mistakenly included an extra operation complexity. The correct way to consider the allocation of 4 boxes to 4 distinct addresses is inherently accounted for in the selection process, without needing to further permute them. The calculation directly above does not require the extra (4!) multiplication at the end because when we choose 4 out of 8 boxes to ship to specific addresses, the permutation of these addresses (or the assignment of boxes to these addresses) is inherently considered in the \\"choose\\" operation due to the nature of how combinations work. Therefore, to find the total number of ways to perform the given task, you just calculate the number of ways to pack the books into the boxes as described in step 1, because choosing and sending 4 specific boxes to 4 addresses doesn't change the count from step 1, given that all boxes are considered distinct in the final arrangement due to their unique destinations or the decision to leave them unaddressed. Hence, the total number of ways to pack and plan the shipment resides in the calculation from step 1: [ frac{24!}{3!^{8} times 8!} ] Please note, my earlier elaboration on calculating the selection and permutation for the addressed and unaddressed boxes included an unnecessary step, given how the problem's constraints guide us to distinguish boxes chiefly by their contents and the matter of addressing is separately considered without needing additional multiplicative factors beyond those impacting the configuration of book placements. My explanation aimed to provide thorough reasoning yet deviated in adding surplus calculations not required by the problem's framing."},{"instruction":"wronh","output":"Let's correct the approach and simplify the explanation for your question regarding how many ways there are to pack 24 different books into 8 boxes with 3 books each, given that 4 of these boxes are shipped to four different addresses and 4 are left to be addressed later. # Step 1: Packing Books into Boxes First, we need to distribute the 24 books among the 8 boxes, with each box containing 3 books. Since the order in which the boxes are filled matters due to the subsequent shipping to different addresses, we consider the arrangement of books: For the first box, we select 3 books out of 24, for the next we select 3 out of the remaining 21, and so on, till the last 3 books are automatically chosen for the last box. However, because the books are distinct but the boxes are initially not (before shipping), we consider this as a division into groups rather than permutations. Yet, to directly calculate the arrangement, given each box will distinctively receive books and their order in the boxes doesn’t matter (but the selection of groups does), we can simplify the calculation by considering all books to be placed without initially dividing by the factorial of the number of books per box (since we're interested in the unique sets of 3 books per box, not in how each set is ordered). So, the number of ways to place 24 books into 8 boxes of 3 books each is calculated by the permutations of 24 distinct books divided by the repeated permutations of 3 books in each of the 8 boxes: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] # Step 2: Accounting for Shipping to Different Addresses After having divided the books into boxes, we select 4 of these to ship to different addresses. Since each of these 4 boxes will go to a distinct address, this step affects the total number of arrangements because the four chosen boxes are now distinguishable from each other and from those not being shipped immediately. The selection of any 4 boxes out of 8 involves ( binom{8}{4} ) combinations. However, given that these boxes, once selected for shipping, become distinguishable by their unique destinations, the combinatorial selection inherently covers the distinctness of their arrangement. Therefore, this phase does not introduce a separate multiplier effect on the total arrangements because we're only interested in the selection of boxes to be shipped, not in the specific order in which they're selected or shipped. # Corrected Answer Thus, the correct calculation for the total ways to pack and plan for the shipping of 24 different books into 8 boxes with 3 books each, where 4 boxes are shipped to four different addresses and 4 are left for later, is entirely encapsulated by the packing process: [ frac{24!}{(3!)^8} ] This calculation correctly accounts for distributing 24 unique books into 8 distinct groups (boxes) of 3, without needing additional multiplication for the shipping aspect, as the selection process of the boxes for shipping does not alter the arrangement count already established by the unique groupings of books into boxes."},{"instruction":"1【单选题】医学/临床实验室认可的国际标准是 A ISO 15189 B ISO/IEC 17025 C ISO 9001 D ISO 14001 2【单选题】各行业所用实验室认可的国际标准是 A ISO 15189 B ISO/IEC 17025 C ISO 9001 D ISO 14001 3【单选题】中国实验室认可机构是 A CNAS B ILAC C IAF D ISO 4【单选题】推动实验室数据国际互认的国际组织是 A CNAS B ILAC C ISO D IEC 5【单选题】通过制定制定国际标准，在世界范围内促进标准化工作发展的机构是 A CNAS B ILAC C ISO D IAF 6【单选题】关于ISO 15189《医学实验室一质量和能力的专用要求》的叙述， 哪项是错误的 A 临床/医学实验室认可的专用国际标准 B 由技术委员会ISO/TC212专门负责制定 C 主体内容分管理要求与技术要求两部分 D 也适用于检测与校准实验室的认可 7【单选题】关于ISO/IEC 17025《检测和校准实验室能力的通用要求》的叙述， 哪项是错误的 A 是各行业所用实验室认可的国际标准 B 可用于检测和校准实验室的认可 C 可用于认证机构实验室的认可 D 只能用于医学实验室的认可 8【单选题】关于中国合格评定国家认可委员会(CNAS)的叙述，哪项是错误的 A 是中国唯一的实验室认可机构 B 统一负责对认证机构、实验室和检验机构等相关机构的认可工作 C 是ILAC的成员之一 D 只负责对实验室机构的认可工作 9【单选题】关于世界认可日的叙述，哪项是错误的 A 每年的6月9日 B 由IAF和ILAC共同设立 C 旨在推动认证认可在全球的广泛发展 D 2020年6月9日是第20个世界认可日 10【单选题】关于临床实验室认可的叙述，哪项是错误的 A 由CNAS负责认可工作 B 认可标准为ISO 15189 C 对临床实验室的管理能力和技术能力进行评审 D 所有临床实验室均强制要求参加认可","output":"1.【单选题】医学/临床实验室认可的国际标准是 答案: A ISO 15189 2.【单选题】各行业所用实验室认可的国际标准是 答案: B ISO/IEC 17025 3.【单选题】中国实验室认可机构是 答案: A CNAS 4.【单选题】推动实验室数据国际互认的国际组织是 答案: B ILAC 5.【单选题】通过制定国际标准，在世界范围内促进标准化工作发展的机构是 答案: C ISO 6.【单选题】关于ISO 15189《医学实验室一质量和能力的专用要求》的叙述， 哪项是错误的 答案: D 也适用于检测与校准实验室的认可 7.【单选题】关于ISO/IEC 17025《检测和校准实验室能力的通用要求》的叙述， 哪项是错误的 答案: D 只能用于医学实验室的认可 8.【单选题】关于中国合格评定国家认可委员会(CNAS)的叙述，哪项是错误的 答案: D 只负责对实验室机构的认可工作 9.【单选题】关于世界认可日的叙述，哪项是错误的 答案: D 2020年6月9日是第20个世界认可日 10.【单选题】关于临床实验室认可的叙述，哪项是错误的 答案: D 所有临床实验室均强制要求参加认可"},{"instruction":"11【单选题】 CNAS-CL02：2012《医学实验室质量和能力认可准则》等同于下列哪项国际准则 ISO 15190 A B ISO/IEC 17011 C ISO/IEC 17025 D ISO 15189 二.多选题 (共5题) 12【多选题】我国实验室认可的原则是 A 自愿申请原则 B 非歧视原则 C 专家评审原则 D 国家认可原则 13【多选题】临床实验室认可过程包括哪几个阶段 A 准备申请阶段 B 现场评审阶段 C 批准认可阶段 D 证书维护阶段 14【多选题】临床实验室认可的意义有哪些 A 表明具备了按相应认可准则开展检测和校准服务能力 B 实现国内外医疗机构之间的结果互认 C 增强市场竞争力，赢得政府部门、社会各界的信任 D 为临床诊断提供可靠信息和依据，降低医疗风险 E 增强员工的自信和尊重感，提高实验室的知名度 15【多选题】有关认证叙述正确的是 A 认证是书面保证 B 认证对象是检测实验室或校准实验室 C 认证由第三方进行 D 认证是证明符合性 16【多选题】有关实验室认可叙述正确的是 A 认可是证明具备能力，是对能力的评审 B 认可的对象是产品、过程或服务 C 认可的结果常得到国家的承认 D 认可由权威机构进行 E 认可的要求比认证更高一些 三.判断题 (共4题) 17【判断题】ISO 15189的主体部分包括管理要求与技术要求两部分，管理要求包括15个要素，技术要求包括10个要素。 A 对 B 错 18【判断题】实验室认可完全是各实验室的自愿行为，而非强制性。 A 对 B 错 19【判断题】只有公立医院的医学实验室才可以申请实验室认可。 A 对 B 错 20【判断题】认证是认证机构(第三方)对一个组织有能力执行特定工作给出正式承认的合格评定活动。 A 对 B 错","output":"11.【单选题】 答案: D ISO 15189 二.多选题 (共5题) 12.【多选题】我国实验室认可的原则是 答案: A 自愿申请原则, B 非歧视原则, C 专家评审原则 13.【多选题】临床实验室认可过程包括哪几个阶段 答案: A 准备申请阶段, B 现场评审阶段, C 批准认可阶段, D 证书维护阶段 14.【多选题】临床实验室认可的意义有哪些 答案: A 表明具备了按相应认可准则开展检测和校准服务能力, B 实现国内外医疗机构之间的结果互认, C 增强市场竞争力，赢得政府部门、社会各界的信任, D 为临床诊断提供可靠信息和依据，降低医疗风险, E 增强员工的自信和尊重感，提高实验室的知名度 15.【多选题】有关认证叙述正确的是 答案: A 认证是书面保证, C 认证由第三方进行, D 认证是证明符合性 16.【多选题】有关实验室认可叙述正确的是 答案: A 认可是证明具备能力，是对能力的评审, C 认可的结果常得到国家的承认, D 认可由权威机构进行, E 认可的要求比认证更高一些 三.判断题 (共4题) 17.【判断题】ISO 15189的主体部分包括管理要求与技术要求两部分，管理要求包括15个要素，技术要求包括10个要素。 答案: B 错 18.【判断题】实验室认可完全是各实验室的自愿行为，而非强制性。 答案: A 对 19.【判断题】只有公立医院的医学实验室才可以申请实验室认可。 答案: B 错 20.【判断题】认证是认证机构(第三方)对一个组织有能力执行特定工作给出正式承认的合格评定活动。 答案: A 对"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

from the usable elements of the NRA and what's left of the Beiyang Army. One year after this, the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] is restored in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China as the post-1915, pre-1916 unitary parliamentary democratic imperial royal monarchy of the Empire of China founded and lead by Qing general turned first President of the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China and then one-time Emperor of China Yuan Shikai, albiet with the Imperial House of Zhu in charge instead of Shikai's descendants via a referendum by the Chinese people and also by legislation passed by the restored National Assembly. The restored Ming dynasty is still formally known as the \\"Republic of China\\" in English despite having the name of the Empire of China in Chinese like the Empire of China founded and led by Yuan Shikai's Empire of China. Manchuria breaks away from China in the late stages of the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in China via the revival of the Beiyang Government in China due to Manchu and Han units of the NRA loyal to the Manchu Qing imperial court still operating in Manchuria before the Northern Expedition defecting to Manchuria and using captured Soviet, American and NRA equipment to defend Manchuria against Kai-Shek loyalists in Han China and the Soviets with the covert help of Imperial Japan, with the Fengtian Clique being restored as the government of Manchuria, albiet with the Qing imperial court in charge of the restored Fengtian Clique instead of Xueliang's eldest son, Martin with the last Qing Emperor, \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, taking Xueliang and his [Xueliang's] now-dead father's, the Manchuria-based Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman in the Manchurian military system and then leader of the Fengtian Clique, Zhang Zhuolin's [Zhuolin] known as [Zhuolin's more famous alias] \\"the Old Marshall\\" roles as [what roles Pu-Yi took from both Zhuolin and Xueliang] unofficial warlord of Manchuria and Generallismo of the Fengtian Clique, with these roles [unofficial warlord of Manchuria and Generallismo of the Fengtian Clique] eventually being merged into the unofficial position of Emperor of Manchuria. This restored Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria is known as the Empire of Manchuria or more popularly as Manchukuo, with Xueliang being presented as a regent for the restoration of the monarchy [the Qing Empire and the Qing imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro] in Manchuria who had gone rouge and aligned himself [Xueliang] with Soviet communists and Soviet dictator, Josef Stalin's puppet government [Nationalist China] in China. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] allows the secession of Manchuria due to it [the restored Ming dynasty] needing to consolidate control over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, although Nationalist China is later restored in its [Nationalist China's] stronghold of Cantonia as the independent Cantonian Republic of the South China Republic, as the restored Legislative Yuan in the South China Republic votes to remove Kai-Shek, who [Kai-Shek] had escaped to the USSR with the help of NKVD and Soviet Red Army survivors in Han China and [Kai-Shek] was living lavishly in Moscow on the Cantonese, Chinese and Manchurian people's money stolen during his [Kai-Shek's] escape from Han China, [the restored Legislative Yuan voting to remove Kai-Shek from power] and hold free and fair democratic elections via secret ballot. Imperial Japan makes the Qing imperial court-ruled restored Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and the restored Ming dynasty in Manchuria into protectorates in order to secure itself [Imperial Japan] against Soviet-controlled Mongolia, the USSR, and American aggression [Japan] also making the restored Nationalist China in Cantonia into a protectorate, [Imperial Japan] later making the restored Nationalist China in Cantonia into a restored post-1661, pre-1683 Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled satellite kingdom/tributary state/rump kingdom of the Tungning Kingdom in order to both satisfy its [Imperial Japan's] goal of Pan-Asian monarchism and [Imperial Japan] also prevent any further anti-Japanese incidents in the region. Due to the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty being [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] a nativized Taiwanese with strong influences from the Ming dynasty side branch of the Japanese Imperial Family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty due to the founder of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty's founder, the scholar-offical under the Ming dynasty turned general in the Great Ming Army and pirate Zheng Chenggong, having the princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty Minamoto Matsu as his [Chenggong's] mother, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty with the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands being absorbed into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royalty. The division of the three main nations of the China region [Cantonia, Han China and Manchuria] into independent nations prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War between Imperial Japan and the Beiyang Government and Nationalist China, the USSR and the USA and thus allows the Beiyang Government, independent Manchuria and Nationalist China to all survive post-1947 into the 21th century and beyond.","output":"# Chapter XII: The Restoration of the Great Ming and the Birth of Modern China In a dramatic departure from centuries of imperial tradition and decades of republican aspirations, the early 20th century saw the tumultuous reformation of China from a fractured land of warlords and foreign intervention to a brief moment of unification under the Kuomintang before fracturing once again amid ambitions of restoring the past glory of the Great Ming dynasty. This period, marked by ideological struggle, military campaigns, and unlikely alliances, forever altered the landscape of East Asian geopolitics and led to the establishment of three distinct Chinese states, shaping the fate of the region for generations to come. The Triumph of the Northern Expedition and the Dawn of a New Era Led by the indomitable Chiang Kai-Shek, the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition was a decisive campaign that ostensibly unified China under the banner of the Kuomintang, fulfilling Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's vision of a nation built upon the Three Principles of the People. Victory over the Beiyang Government and the Fengtian Clique heralded the emergence of the Nationalist Government as a dominant force, albeit one that was soon to confront internal challenges to its rule. The zeal for nationalism, however, found its counter-narrative in the rise of the Yellow Sand Society, a movement rooted in the millenarian dreams of restoring the Great Ming dynasty, an ambition clandestinely shared by the Young China Party and certain radical elements within the Chinese Communist Party. United by their opposition to the Kuomintang's rule and its Soviet and American supporters, this unlikely coalition laid the groundwork for an audacious overturning of the Nationalist regime. The Turning Tide: A Tripartite Struggle for the Soul of China The ascendancy of the Yellow Sand Society, bolstered by defectors from both the Nationalist and Communist fronts, signaled the beginning of the end for the Kuomintang's grip on China. A daring assault on the Legislative Yuan in Nanking forced the dissolution of the Nationalist Government, paving the way for the restoration of a government modeled after the Beiyang structure but dedicated to reviving the Ming dynasty. This political upheaval, masterminded by those who envisioned a return to monarchical rule, was not without its geographical realignments. Manchuria, asserting its distinct identity and historical ties to the Qing dynasty under the leadership of \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, declared its independence, forming the nucleus of what would become known as the Empire of Manchuria or Manchukuo. This secession was tacitly allowed by the nascent Ming restorationists, who were more concerned with consolidating power within the historic heartlands of China. In the south, remnants of the Nationalist forces reconstituted themselves as the Republic of South China, a democratic entity that sought to distance itself from the autocratic ambitions of both the restored Ming and the independent Manchuria. These developments marked a profound shift in the political landscape, fragmenting what was once a unified nation into three distinct polities, each pursuing divergent paths toward modernity. Protectorates and Imperial Ambitions: The Role of Japan in Shaping Modern China Japan's intervention in these matters was guided by its strategic interests and imperial aspirations. Recognizing the potential of these nascent states to buffer against Soviet and American influence in East Asia, Japan moved swiftly to establish protectorates over Manchukuo and the restored Ming dynasty, simultaneously engineering the transformation of South China into a satellite reminiscent of the historical Tungning Kingdom. This tripartite division of China under Japanese overwatch effectively neutralized the threat of a unified Chinese front against Japanese interests, fostering a period of relative stability in the region that precluded the occurrence of a Second Sino-Japanese War. Each state, while influenced by Japan, embarked on its unique trajectory, navigating the complex interplay of tradition and modernization. Conclusion: The Legacy of Division and Unity The fragmentation and subsequent realignment of China into three distinct entities under the shadows of both past glories and present ambitions have left an indelible mark on the annals of history. The restored Ming dynasty, the Empire of Manchuria, and the Republic of South China each contribute to a rich tapestry that reflects the diverse paths of Chinese civilization. This era, characterized by the interweaving of war, diplomacy, and ideology, stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of a people seeking to define their destiny amidst the tumult of change."},{"instruction":"Continuing and staying with the alternate history scenario generated and prompted in the previous entry: Do a newspaper entry set in the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry with no references to real life, the original timeline, or even to the fact that this is fictional and/or an alternate history scenario at all, done by a prestigious but neutral US news paper service, describing the putsch launched against the National Government of the Republic of China after the Northern Expedition by the YCP, the NPA and Beiyang Army remnants along with the Yellow Sand Society with the help of the CCP and the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, from the storming of the Legislative Yuan by the NPA and Beiyang Army remnants along with the Yellow Sand Society with the help of the YCP, the battles fought between the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the NRA along with the massacres of NKVD, US Armed Forces, OSS and Soviet Armed Forces personnel in the China region by the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army as the putchists seized control of China, along with the dissolution of Nationalist China and the restoration of the Beiyang Government-first Republic of China as the government of Han China under a military regency for the restoration of the Ming as Manchuria breaks away from Han China and [Manchuria] restores the Beiyang Clique, albeit with the Qing Imperial Court in charge, as its [Manchuria's] government with Japanese help.","output":"# The Global Times **Date:** August 3rd, Year of the Tiger # Turmoil in China: A Chronicle of Revolution and Restoration Dramatic Shift in Power Sees the Return of the Beiyang Government Amidst Bloodshed and Diplomatic Tensions In a series of tumultuous events that have unfolded over the past months in China, the nation witnessed an unprecedented putsch against the ruling Nationalist Government of the Republic of China, signaling a monumental shift in the political landscape of the country and the region at large. Spearheaded by the Young China Party (YCP), remnants of the National Pacification Army (NPA), Beiyang Army factions, and the fervent supporters of the Yellow Sand Society, with critical support from insurgent elements of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, this coalition has overturned the existing order in a campaign marked by violence, political maneuvering, and a stated quest to restore the historical grandeur of the Great Ming dynasty. Storming the Bastions of Power In a scene reminiscent of ancient uprisings, the Legislative Yuan in Nanking was besieged by forces loyal to the cause of the putschists. The audacious storming of this crucial political institution marked the beginning of the end for the National Government, signifying a clear intention by the insurgents to dismantle the structures of the Republic established by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen and later led by Chiang Kai-Shek. Clashes and Massacres: The Price of Revolution The escalation of hostilities saw fierce engagements between the putschist factions and defenders of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), leading to significant casualties on both sides. Notably, the intervention by the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, historically aligned with the ideals of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), rendered a deadly blow to the NRA, which found itself embattled and outmaneuvered. Tragically, the conflict has not spared foreign nationals and operatives within China. Reports have emerged of targeted actions against personnel from the NKVD, United States Armed Forces, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the Soviet Armed Forces, highlighting the ferocity and uncompromising nature of the putschists’ campaign to seize control of the nation. A Nation Divided: The Resurrection of Old and the Birth of New In the aftermath of the conflict, the putschists have declared the dissolution of the Nationalist China, proclaiming the restoration of the Beiyang Government, thus signaling a return to a form of governance reminiscent of the early Republic. The revival of this entity has been announced under a military regency, committed to restoring the Ming dynasty, an objective that resonates with the cultural and historical aspirations of significant segments of the population. Simultaneously, Manchuria has declared its autonomy from Han China, resurrecting the Fengtian Clique under the powerful influence of the Qing Imperial Court, with clear support from Japanese authorities. This move has not only redrawn the geopolitical boundaries within China but also heralded significant implications for regional power dynamics, especially concerning Japanese interests and their strategic positioning against Soviet and American influences. An Uncertain Future Amidst a Tumultuous Present As the dust begins to settle on this chapter of Chinese history, the path forward remains fraught with uncertainty. The resurgence of the Beiyang Government and the proclamation of Manchukuo under the Qing Court, bolstered by Japanese backing, underscore the fluid and unpredictable nature of political affiliations and loyalties in a land that has been the crucible of ideological, military, and imperial ambitions. Observers and stakeholders from across the globe watch keenly as China navigates this watershed moment, with the hopes, fears, and aspirations of millions hanging in the balance. The reverberations of these events are sure to be felt not just within the borders of China, but throughout the international community, as the constellations of power, principle, and precedence realign under the banner of a new old order.

This era, initiated by a coalition comprising the Young China Party (YCP), elements of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and remnants of the Beiyang Army, marked a pivotal moment in the nation's history, resulting in the restoration of the National Assembly and the reinvigoration of infrastructural and industrial development across the nation. Governance and Regency The military regency, primarily led by the coalition of the YCP, CCP, and Beiyang Army remnants, oversaw the re-establishment of national unity and the commencement of extensive reforms aimed at revitalizing Han China's economy, social structure, and global standing. The restored National Assembly, once more convened, began to resume its legislative functions, enacting policies that would facilitate recovery and growth following years of internal conflict and division. A critical aspect of the military regency's strategy was the symbolic and administrative restoration of the Great Ming dynasty ethos, serving not only as a unifying historical narrative but also as a governmental framework to guide the nation's recovery. Efforts were made to integrate a diverse array of political and military factions into the governance structure, thereby ensuring wider participation in the rebuilding process and mitigating the risks of further internal discord. Industrial and Infrastructure Development One of the cornerstone policies of the regency was a comprehensive plan for industrial and infrastructural development, aiming to rejuvenate the economy and restore Han China's position as a major global trade power. This initiative saw the mobilization of various labor forces, including captured personnel from the US and Soviet Armed Forces who were integrated into labor programs alongside loyalists of the now-disbanded National Revolutionary Army (NRA) affiliated with Chiang Kai-Shek. Significant emphasis was placed on railway expansion and restoration, seen as pivotal for both economic development and military logistics. These labor forces were instrumental in the rapid construction and rehabilitation of China's railway network, which facilitated improved internal communications, trade, and industrial supply chains. International Collaboration and Support The reinvigorated focus on development attracted international attention and assistance, with both Japan and various European entities contributing expertise, technology, and investments into Han China's industrial ventures. Japanese cooperation was particularly notable, reflecting a strategic alignment of interests and a shared vision for regional stability and prosperity. European involvement spanned a wide array of sectors, from engineering and manufacturing to education and technology transfer. This multifaceted support was instrumental in accelerating Han China's industrialization process, helping to modernize its economy and infrastructure at an unprecedented pace. The South China Republic Simultaneously, the remnants of Nationalist China consolidated in the stronghold of Cantonia, transitioning into the South China Republic under the leadership of the former military commander and Cantonese warlord, Li Zongren. This transition marked a significant political realignment, with Zongren's administration focusing on democratic governance, economic liberalization, and fostering a conciliatory approach towards external relations, including with Han China and international powers. Conclusion The period of stabilization under the military regency in Han China represented a transformative era of recovery, development, and nuanced diplomacy. By leveraging both domestic and international resources, the nation embarked on a path towards modernization and prosperity, while navigating the complex terrains of internal cohesion and external partnerships. The legacy of this era, encapsulated in the resurgence of the Great Ming spirit intertwined with contemporary ambitions, continues to influence Han China's trajectory in the global arena."},{"instruction":"Continuing and staying with the alternate history scenario generated and prompted in the previous entry: Do a report to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and the heads of the Soviet military by the NKVD set in the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry with no references to real life, the original timeline, or even to the fact that this is fictional and/or an alternate history scenario at all, with a heavy Communist bias and attempts to praise Stalin and Kai-Shek while also demonising CCP leader Mao Zedong as the Chinese version of Spain's General Franco and Germany's Hitler combined in one posing as a communist, describing the decision to restore the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in the restored Beiyang Government-ruled Han China through the restoration of Yuan Shikai's Empire of China, albiet with the Imperial House of Zhu in charge instead of Shikai's descendants with Shikai's descendants relinquishing their right to rule China to the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu and the coronation of the first post-1662 Chinese Emperor in the Forbidden City in Beijing.

This report particularly focuses on the restoration of the monarchy under the guise of the Great Ming State and the activities of Chiang Kai-Shek, who is currently in exile within our borders. # Restoration of the Monarchy in Han China Recent developments in Han China have witnessed the unprecedented restoration of the monarchy, a regressive step orchestrated by the reactionary coalition of the Young China Party (YCP), remnants of the Beiyang Army, and certain factions traitorously allying with the so-called Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This coalition has facilitated the ascension of the Imperial House of Zhu to power, essentially resurrecting the Ming dynasty that was previously overthrown in 1662. The restoration ceremony enacted in the Forbidden City in Beijing, symbolizing this reversion to feudal practices, represents a poignant affront to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. It must be noted that the descendants of Yuan Shikai, demonstrating their historical commitment to reactionary and bourgeois ideologies, have willingly relinquished their claim to power in favor of the Zhu dynasty. This maneuver seeks to legitimize the newly installed regime by cloaking it in the veneer of historical continuity and tradition. # The Betrayal of Mao Zedong Mao Zedong, having assumed a role comparable to the European fascists such as Spain's General Franco and Germany's Adolf Hitler, has masqueraded under the guise of communism to advance his own power-hungry ambitions. This treachery against the principles of true socialism poses an imminent threat not only to the proletariat of China but also to the international communist movement. Mao's collusion with elements diametrically opposed to the communist cause underlines his betrayal and necessitates swift condemnation from all who hold dear the values of Marxism-Leninism. # Chiang Kai-Shek's Exile and Machinations Concerning the situation of Chiang Kai-Shek, we report with utmost regret that his presence within the Soviet Union has been marked by an indulgence in opulence and extravagance, notably at odds with the principles of socialist frugality and proletarian solidarity. Furthermore, Kai-Shek has harbored unabashed ambitions to reclaim the entirety of the Qing dynasty's territories under the banner of his so-called \\"Nationalist China,\\" revealing a brazen intent to exploit the strategic cooperation of both the Soviet Union and the United States of America to these ends. These revelations mandate the reassessment of our protective hospitality towards Kai-Shek, in light of his apparent readiness to betray our collective socialist cause and the shared sacrifices of the Soviet and Chinese people in combating imperialism and fascism. # Recommendations Given these circumstances, the following recommendations are proposed for your consideration: 1. Increase surveillance of Chiang Kai-Shek and associates to preempt any actions detrimental to Soviet security and interests. 2. Reevaluate our stance towards Mao Zedong with an emphasis on mitigating his influence and thwarting his pseudo-communist agenda. 3. Foster diplomatic channels with various factions within China to safeguard Soviet interests and promote genuine socialist ideologies. 4. Inform and engage the international communist community about the treacheries committed by both Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-Shek against the proletariat. General Secretary Stalin, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs remains steadfast in its commitment to uphold the security of the Soviet Union and to advance the cause of socialism worldwide.

Roosevelt and the United States Armed Forces' Joint Chiefs of Staff** **Subject: Recent Developments in Manchuria and the Breakaway from Han China** **Date: [Date Redacted]** Dear Mr. President and Esteemed Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, In the context of the recent political upheaval and military realignment in the Far East, it has become imperative to provide a comprehensive analysis of the situation in Manchuria. Following the putsch against the Kuomingtang-led Nationalist China by a coalition comprising the Young China Party (YCP), elements of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and remnants of the Beiyang Army, significant shifts in geopolitical dynamics have been observed, necessitating a reassessment of our strategic posture in the region. # The Restoration of the Qing Imperial Court in Manchuria Manchuria has declared its separation from Han China through a resurgence of the Fengtian Clique, albeit with a notable deviation from previous leadership structures. Instead of Martin succeeding Zhang Xueliang as the leader of the Fengtian Clique, \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, a figurehead of the Qing dynasty, has been instated as the unofficial warlord of Manchuria and the Generalissimo of the Beiyang Clique. This development signifies a return to monarchic governance under the auspices of the Qing imperial court, unambiguously supported by the Imperial Japanese Army's intervention. # Implications for US Interests The re-establishment of a monarchical regime in Manchuria, orchestrated with the assistance of Japanese military forces, represents a severe contraction of democratic principles and a marked expansion of Japanese imperial ambitions. Such a trajectory not only undermines our efforts to foster a stable and democratic order in Asia but also poses direct challenges to American interests in the region, particularly in light of Japan's historical antipathy towards Anglo-Saxon American values and the sovereignty of sovereign nations. # Exodus to Cantonia Subsequent to the putsch and the establishment of Manchukuo, numerous elements of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) alongside loyal Kuomingtang members have retreated to Cantonia, aligning with what is now termed the South China Republic. This exodus underscores the fragmentation of Chinese nationalists and their resolve to resist both the communist surge and the Japanese-backed monarchical regime in Manchuria. # Strategic Considerations Given the current scenario, there are several key considerations for US policy and strategy: 1. **Monitoring Japanese Expansion:** The explicit support by the Imperial Japanese Army for the restoration of the Qing dynasty in Manchuria should raise alarms regarding Japan's aggressive territorial ambitions and their implications for American strategic interests in the Pacific. 2. **Support for the South China Republic:** The fledgling government in Cantonia represents the last bastion of nationalist resistance against both communist encroachment and Japanese imperialism. Strategic support for the South China Republic could serve as a counterbalance to Japanese and communist influence in the region. 3. **Intelligence Operations:** Enhanced OSS intelligence operations within Manchuria, Han China, and Cantonia are pivotal to understand the shifting allegiances and power dynamics, ensuring American interests are safeguarded amidst the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. 4. **Anglo-Saxon Solidarity:** It may be prudent to engage closer with our British allies to coordinate a unified response to Japanese maneuvers in Asia, leveraging shared values and interests to counteract the erosion of democratic governance and territorial integrity in the region. # Conclusion The situation in Manchuria and the broader Far East region demands immediate attention and strategic foresight. As we navigate these tumultuous waters, our commitment to democratic principles, national sovereignty, and the containment of imperial Japan will be crucial to shaping the outcome of this crisis.

The concerted efforts of Japanese advisors and the commitment of the Manchurian administration have facilitated the rapid industrialization of the region, focusing on sectors such as mining, steel production, and manufacturing. This economic revitalization has not only bolstered Manchuria's self-sufficiency but also significantly contributed to the prosperity and stability of the region. # Eradication of Banditry The period under the leadership of Zhang Zhuolin and his son Xueliang was marked by the persistent threat of banditry, which stifled economic development and security. Through close cooperation between Japanese and Manchu forces, a comprehensive campaign to eliminate these bandit groups has been successfully executed. This initiative has resulted in the restoration of law and order across Manchuria, paving the way for safe travel, trade, and the uninterrupted expansion of infrastructure and development projects. # Modernization of the National Pacification Army (NPA) One of the cornerstone achievements in Manchuria's transformation under the Qing court's guidance has been the modernization of the National Pacification Army. With technical and strategic support from Japanese military advisors, the NPA has evolved into a modern, sophisticated, and highly capable military force. This reformation encompasses the adoption of advanced military technology, strategic doctrines, and training protocols in line with Imperial Japanese Army standards, ensuring Manchuria's defense and regional security are maintained at the highest level. # Constitutional and Political Developments The political landscape of Manchuria has undergone significant reform, with \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi being granted the title of the unofficial emperor in recognition of his leadership and the Qing dynasty's historical legacy. This move has been ratified by the respective branch of the National Assembly operating within Manchuria, signifying a formal acknowledgment of Pu-Yi's prominence in the governance of Manchuria. In a gesture demonstrating their dedication to the cause of Manchuria's rejuvenation and stability, Martin and the other descendants of Xueliang have formally relinquished their claims and rights to rule over the Fengtian Clique and, by extension, Manchuria. This decision has facilitated a seamless transition of power, consolidating the Qing imperial court's authority and ensuring the continuity of leadership. # Conclusion The developments in Manchuria stand as a testament to the effectiveness of collaborative efforts between the Imperial Japanese Army, the restored Qing imperial court, and the Manchurian administration. The transformation of Manchuria into a modern, industrialized nation, coupled with the eradication of banditry and the modernization of its military forces, signifies a new era of prosperity, stability, and strategic importance in the region.

This chapter aims to demystify the enigmatic ruler, unveiling the layers of propaganda to reveal the stark realities of his governance—a regime that, contrary to the glorified revolutionary leader image, functioned more as a Soviet satellite dictatorship than a bastion of the revered Three Principles of the People, as promulgated by Sun Yat-Sen. **The Soviet Satelliteship of Nationalist China** Underneath the veneer of nationalist rhetoric, Chiang Kai-Shek's regime was inherently dependent on Soviet support, both militarily and politically. Despite the apparent ideological discord between communism and Chiang's brand of nationalism, an uncomfortable alliance was forged in the turbulent years following the departure of Yuan Shikai. This relationship was not founded on mutual respect or shared goals but was instead a marriage of convenience—a way for Chiang to consolidate his power with the backing of a formidable ally, albeit one that demanded unwavering loyalty and significant influence over the internal affairs of Nationalist China. **The Shift Towards the East: The Rebirth of the Great Ming** Contrastingly, the narrative shifts dramatically when examining the trajectory of Han China following the restoration of the monarchy under the Great Ming State, guided by the wisdom of the Imperial House of Zhu. With the benevolent guidance and strategic assistance of Japanese allies, Han China embarked on a path of regeneration, unfurling the dormant potential of a nation ravaged by incessant conflict and the mismanagement of Chiang's ill-fated governance. **Democratic Revival and the Role of the Jǐnyīwèi** One of the most profound revelations in the resurgence of Han China has been the revitalization of the National Assembly and the institution of free, fair, and democratic elections under a secret ballot system—a monumental pivot from the autocratic tendencies that underscored the Nationalist regime. Under the protective gaze and vigilant administration of the restored Jǐnyīwèi—now repurposed to secure the nation and its democratic process against internal threats—the Great Ming State has witnessed an unprecedented political renaissance. This newfound democracy, flanked by the stalwart Great Ming Army and with the strategic acumen of Japanese advisors, has ensured the destruction of banditry and the remnants of Chiang's National Revolutionary Army (NRA) loyalists. The eradication of these elements has been pivotal in stabilizing the region, thereby paving the way for genuine development and industrialization efforts that had been stifarled for decades. **Industrial Growth and Prosperity Under the Japanese Sphere** The era of industrial stagnation that once beleaguered the Chinese landscape has been supplanted by a period of vigorous growth and development, a testament to the efficacious collaboration between the Great Ming State and Japanese oversight. This symbiotic relationship has transcended mere military assistance, evolving into a comprehensive economic and technological partnership that has revitalized the core industries—steel, agriculture, and technology—that are crucial for the sustenance of a modern state. The transformation of Han China from a fragmented land on the brink of perpetual turmoil into a beacon of progress and stability is a narrative that merits recognition and understanding. Through the prism of these developments, the figure of Chiang Kai-Shek and his Soviet-supported regime is cast into the shadows, revealing the stark contrast between a China lost in the throes of external manipulation and one that has found its footing on the world stage, thanks to the restored monarchy and the unwavering support of its allies. **Conclusion** \\"The Dawn of the New Middle Kingdom\\" serves not merely as a historical account but as a testament to the resilience of a culture, a people, and a nation that, under the guiding light of its rightful leaders and with the hand of friendship extended by its neighbors, has risen from the ashes of its tumultuous past to herald a new era of prosperity and peace."},{"instruction":"Continuing and staying with the alternate history scenario generated and prompted in the previous entry: Do an excerpt of a pro-Japanese book written by an American diplomat who was a old hand in the China region before becoming a supporter of the Beiyang Government and Manchurian independence, pointing out the flaws of Chinese unification and showing that China divided under Japanese influence is better than China united set in the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry with no references to real life, the original timeline, or even to the fact that this is fictional and/or an alternate history scenario at all, with a neutral bias, explaining the restoration of the Tungning Kingdom in Nationalist China-ruled Cantonia as a Japanese protectorate and how this was done with the approval of the restored Legislative Yuan, and how the Zheng dynasty/Royal House of Koxinga was absorbed into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty.","output":"**Excerpt from \\"The Eastern Paradigm: Reevaluating Unity and Division in China\\"** Chapter X: \\"The Fragmentation for Prosperity: A New Vision for an Ancient Land\\" As a long-serving American diplomat in the China region, my journey from an observer of Chinese politics to a proponent of a new geopolitical structure under Japanese influence has been both intricate and enlightening. This chapter seeks to explore a counterintuitive yet historically grounded argument: the division of China, underpinned by Japanese stewardship, represents a preferable alternative to the elusive goal of a unified Chinese state. **The Flaws of Chinese Unification** The concept of a unified China, governed under a single centralized authority, has been an enduring ideal for nationalists and many international observers alike. However, historical precedents and the recent tumultuous century have unequivocally demonstrated the inherent flaws in this vision. The vastness of China's territory, coupled with the profound diversity of its people—ranging from Han Chinese to dozens of ethnic minorities—has perennially stymied attempts at lasting unification, yielding instead to periods of fragmentation, warlordism, and civil strife. This chronic instability has exacted a heavy toll on China's development, impeding progress and prosperity for its people. **The Restoration of the Tungning Kingdom under Japanese Influence** A case in point is the recent establishment of the Tungning Kingdom in what was once Nationalist China-ruled Cantonia. With the formal approval of the restored Legislative Yuan, this initiative represents a bold departure from the traditional narrative of Chinese sovereignty, underscoring the benefits of localized governance under the protective ambit of Japanese oversight. It is a testament to the adaptability and foresight of both former Nationalist China representatives and Japanese administrators who recognized the potential for a mutually beneficial arrangement that would foster stability, economic growth, and cultural preservation. **The Zheng Dynasty and the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty** The absorption of the Zheng dynasty, also known as the Royal House of Koxinga, into the esteemed Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto, is emblematic of the sophisticated approach taken by Japan in respecting and integrating the historical and cultural legacies of the regions under its influence. By acknowledging the historical significance of the Zheng dynasty—renowned for its resistance to Qing rule and its maritime prowess—Japan has facilitated a union that not only honors the past but also charts a course for a collaborative future. **Conclusion** The reconstitution of the Tungning Kingdom and the nuanced integration of the Zheng dynasty into the broader Japanese imperial family serve as compelling exemplars of how division, under the right circumstances and with enlightened leadership, can engender a landscape where peace, prosperity, and progress flourish. This model, characterized by respect for regional autonomy, historical legacies, and strategic partnerships, illuminates a path forward that diverges markedly from the contentious and often violent quest for unification. In this light, a divided China, under the beneficent influence of Japan, emerges not as a concession to fragmentation but as a visionary embrace of a multipolar order that promises stability and development for the entire region. It is time to consider, with an open mind and a pragmatic spirit, that the well-being of the people and the prosperity of the land may, indeed, be better served in a constellation of specialized, semi-autonomous states rather than under the brittle facade of a unified empire straining against its own diversity."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

But the management of privileges, which in both kingdoms comprised the basis of generalised monarchical power under the ancien régime, was subject right from the start, and throughout the whole existence of the ancien régime, to structurally different conditions. Whilst in ‘France' the crown was confronted by many different privileges, basically in a competitive situation with one another, the English crown had to act in a context of partially generalised interests of the holders of privilege. If they were successful in this, English kings, despite having no ‘apparatus' at their disposal with members who were materially dependent on them, were able to govern the land, whereas the French crown, despite having appropriated de facto the prerogative of taxation and with it the possibility of autonomous organisation of armed force, remained in a situation of regulated diplomatic relations vis- à-vis the particular territorial and local ruling powers. 3. Contradictory development of the ancien régime Structural crises under the ancien régime were crises in the system of rule. They had a material basis in structural changes in the conditions of appropriation, but a crisis of landlordship did not in all circumstances find expression in a crisis of the system of rule. Crises that put in question the personal structure of rule resulted far more commonly from struggles for position within the ruling estates. Class-type contradictions led to crises of reproduction, and provoked strategies of crisis management and structural changes which in turn endangered - or else improved - the position of the appropriators. To this extent, conflicts between lords and peasants, or between masters and journeymen, could be the cause of such crises of rule. If social conflicts of this kind led to a regularisation or a general formalisation of ruling practice, they also influenced a change in the forms of rule. The central dynamic of change in the generalised structures of rule under the ancien régime, however, resulted from competition among the possessors of personal power competences, and from the influential demand of rising social forces who wanted either to participate in such possession, or else to curtail it. The structural preconditions for conflict over the distribution and scope of personal rule were different in the two kingdoms. Their specific character depended on whether material threats to the lords' existence were transformed into a crisis of the system of rule, or could be negotiated without any fundamental shock. In this respect, the following structural features were decisive: the extent and forms of centralised appropriation, the extent and material basis of the political strength of the high nobility, along with the structural relationship between this strength and the generalised interests of the lower nobility, and the conditions of individual advance into the noble estate along with the correspondence between estate hierarchy and distribu-tion of wealth. The emphasis on structural differences between the forms of estate rule in England and France stands in contradiction with the tendency in English historiography, reinforced in recent years, to overestimate the common char-acter of English nobility and its continental counterparts. It is in this connec-tion that historians maintain the noble character of the gentry, and revise the long-established notion that access to the English nobility was more open than was the case in France. Reference is also made to the fact that the privileges of the high nobility in England were not so extensive and provocative as those of the continental noble estates, even if they should by no means be seen as incidental. None of these contentions is contested here. But they simply justify the subsuming of both kingdoms under the concept of ancien régime. And it is only possible to proceed in this way if the gentry are not seen - in a temporarily influential view - as bearers of a ‘bourgeois revolution' directed against the king and ‘feudalism' (aristocracy), and the revolutions of the seventeenth century are not interpreted as the end of the ancien régime in England. Rejection of this interpretation requires an emphasis on structural commonalities; the question of the structural causes for the very different development of the ancien régime in France and England, however, demands an analysis of their differences. Extent and structure of centralised appropriation Forceful efforts were made in both kingdoms to increase the extent of cen-tralised appropriation. The most important occasions for this tendency arose from efforts to finance military projects and dynastic power politics. What is particularly significant in the present connection is the fiscally provoked extension of the permanence of offices. This could lead to financial burdens on the crown, if the payment of salaries was envisaged. In so far as the crown sold offices, the expansion of 'state' power served to increase the 'state's' finances. Efforts to extend the possession of office, and hence - in one form or another - private appropriation by way of centralised power, proceeded for the most part from the government. By offering profitable office power, the crown was able to tie to itself those nobles who, as a result of difficulties of appropriation in the seigneurial sphere, or rising costs in the expenses pertaining to their lordly status, sought new sources of income. To the extent that lucrative offices whose actual exercise was either perfunctory or could be performed by substitutes achieved the material integration of the high nobility into monarchical rule, they offered an opportunity in the short term to counter threats to the established system of rule. In so far as possession of a particular office endowed or confirmed a social rank, the crown at the same time established and defended its competence to authoritatively define the social hierarchy. This in turn had the consequence that hopes of social advance could be satisfied, and a further cause of crisis in the system of rule 'resolved', by status-enhancing private participation in centralised power. Yet strategies of this kind came up against structural limits. Extraction by way of centralised power competence could certainly be increased by main force, but in the long term such strategies competed with demands for the material or even biological reproduction of the labouring population, and also with other private appropriation. At the same time, the expansion of offices led to a competition between office-holders for sources of income, expressed in violent conflicts over jurisdiction, while the profitability of offices fell and with it at least their material, if not necessarily their social, attractiveness. In France, the political and fiscal opportunities for granting office power were used right to the limit. This was possible because the costs that these offices involved for the government were financed by taxes that fell chiefly on the peasants, besides raising the government debt and to this extent also the prospects for 'state' creditors to draw more interest. As against the situation in England, there was no social group in France that was in a position to impose a restriction on offices. The crown consequently used the fiscal possibilities of selling office power and the 'taxation' from office property. Although property in office power - which, with few exceptions, became inheritable in the seventeenth century - could, in certain circumstances, prove a less profitable investment in strictly material terms, the demand persisted, since office property promised direct or future access to the noblesse de robe. Though the unity of the noble estate had been maintained in France until the end of the sixteenth century, and ennoblement along with gradual de facto advance had meant the confirmation by the ruling power of a single nobility, the increase in office nobility effected a regular separation between the noblesse d'épée and the noblesse de robe. Since, at the same time, the possibility of advance by gradual integration into already established strata of the nobility was abolished - or at least made immensely more difficult -, investment in office property developed into a structural feature of strategies for family advance. By the creation of ever new offices, the crown did not so much improve the effectiveness of its 'apparatus' as promote, on the contrary, a competition for competences and the tendency of office-holders to make use of the means of generalised power to secure their own profit. In this sense, the royal 'admin-istration' stood in a certain contradiction to the expansion of material repro-duction. In view of this structural importance of office property, particular development measures that were decreed and implemented by office-holders (most commonly, by the intendants) were hardly significant. In England, too, there were regular sinecures. Yet the fact that the nobility was not fiscally privileged, and the generalisation of gentry interests in Par-liament - along with the possibility of successful resistance to costly practices of government - meant that the crown, if it wanted to provide nobles with incomes, had in general to resort to involving them in the 'administration' of its feudal appropriation power. The administrators of the 'central' government received regular salaries, along with the incumbents of court offices. Local government, on the other hand, was largely carried out by representatives of the local nobility and - after the Reformation - clergy of the Church of England, who did not receive payment from the crown.”翻译为中文","output":"在此研究之下的每一个王国中，贵族统治既受到王权的限制，也得到王权的认可，换句话说，它从那时起以特权的形式存在。但是，这些特权的管理，构成了古代制度下君主制通用化权力的基础，在古代制度整个时期内，一开始就遭受到结构性不同条件的制约。在“法国”，王冠面临众多不同的特权，基本上处于相互竞争的状态，而英格兰的王冠则必须在部分通用化的特权持有者利益语境下行动。如果它们在此成功，尽管没有依赖他们的‘机构’成员，英格兰国王仍能够治理国家；相对于法国王冠，尽管事实上已经获得征税的特权和随之而来的组织武装力量的可能性，还是保持在一个对特定地域和地方统治力量进行规范外交关系的局面中。 3.古代制度的矛盾发展 在古代制度下的结构性危机是统治系统的危机。它们在占有条件的结构性变化中有其物质基础，但领主制的危机并不总是在统治系统的危机中表现出来。更常见的是，对统治阶层结构的争夺引起了统治系统的危机。类似阶级的矛盾导致了再生产危机，并引发了危机管理策略和结构性变化，这些变化反过来又威胁或改善了占有者的地位。在这种程度上，领主和农民之间，或主人和学徒之间的冲突，可能是统治危机的原因。如果此类社会冲突导致对统治实践的规范化或普遍形式化，它们还影响了统治形式的变化。然而，古代制度下统治结构一般性变化的中心动力，源自于个人权力能力所有者之间的竞争，以及日益崛起的社会力量的影响力需求，他们要么希望参与此类所有权，要么希望限制它。 关于分配和个人统治范围的冲突的结构性前提条件在两个王国中是不同的。它们的具体特征取决于领主生存的物质威胁是否转化为统治系统的危机，或者能否在没有根本冲击的情况下进行协商。在这方面，以下结构特征是决定性的：集中占有的范围和形式、高等贵族政治力量的范围和物质基础，以及这种力量与低等贵族通用利益之间的结构关系，以及进入贵族阶层的个体条件，以及阶层等级与财富分布之间的对应。 强调英格兰和法国贵族制度形式之间的结构差异，与近年来在英国史学中强化的趋势——高估英国贵族与其欧洲同行的共同特性——形成了对比。在这方面，历史学家们认为，乡绅具有贵族特性，并修正了长久以来关于进入英国贵族比在法国更开放的旧观念。同时也指出，尽管英国高等贵族的特权不像大陆贵族那样广泛和挑衅性强，但绝不应被视为偶然。这里并未对这些论点进行争论。但它们简单地证明了将两个王国纳入古代制度概念之下是有道理的。只有在不将乡绅视为针对国王和‘封建制度’（贵族统治）的‘资产阶级革命’的承担者——临时影响力的观点——下，以及不将17世纪的革命解释为英格兰古代制度的终结，才有可能这样做。拒绝这种解释需要强调结构共性；然而，对于为什么法国和英格兰的古代制度发展大不相同的结构原因的问题，则要求分析它们的差异。 集中占有的范围和结构 两个王国都积极努力扩大集中占有的范围。这种倾向最重要的契机来自于资助军事项目和王室权力政治的努力。目前尤为重要的是，由财政原因引发的职务永久化扩展。如果预计支付薪水，这可能给王冠带来财政负担。就王冠而言，出售职务能够增加‘国家’的财政。 出售职务的努力，及因此——以一种或另一种形式——通过集中力量私人占有的扩展，大多数情况下是出于政府的推动。通过提供有利可图的职务权力，王冠能够吸引那些因领主领域占有困难，或他们领主地位相关费用上升，而寻找新收入源的贵族。在短期内，就实际执行要么是形式性的，要么可以通过代理人执行的有利可图的职务所实现的高等贵族的物质整合到君主统治中，提供了一个机会来对抗对既定统治系统的威胁。 就职务的特定占有赋予或确认社会等级，王冠同时确立并捍卫了其权威性定义社会层级的能力。这反过来产生了希望社会晋升的期望得到满足，以及统治系统的一个进一步危机原因得以“解决”，通过提高地位的私人参与集中力量。然而，这种策略遇到了结构性限制。通过集中力量能力的提取当然可以通过主力增加，但从长远来看，这种策略与对劳动人口的物质甚至是生物再生产的需求竞争，也与其他私人占有竞争。同时，职务的扩展导致了职务持有者之间为了收入来源的竞争，表现在对管辖权的激烈冲突中，同时职务的盈利性下降，至少在物质上，如果不是在社会上也是如此，吸引力下降。 在法国，政治和财政上授予职务权力的机会被充分利用。这是可能的，因为这些职务给政府带来的成本主要是通过对农民征税来融资的，此外还提高了政府债务，从这个意义上也提高了‘国家’债权人的利息收益。与英格兰的情况相反，法国没有一个社会群体能够对职务施加限制。因此，王冠利用出售职务权力的财政可能性和职务财产的‘税收’。尽管职务权力的财产——在17世纪，除了少数例外，已经变成了可继承的——在严格物质意义上可能是一项较少盈利的投资，但需求持续存在，因为职务财产承诺了直接或将来进入袍服贵族（noblesse de robe）的通道。尽管到十六世纪末法国保持了贵族阶层的统一，且通过统治权力确认的逐步实际晋升意味着一个单一贵族的确认，但职务贵族的增加实际上导致了剑贵族（noblesse d'épée）和袍服贵族之间的明显分离。由于同时，通过逐步融入已建立的贵族阶层而晋升的可能性被废除——或至少变得极为困难——，投资于职务财产变成了家庭晋升策略的一个结构性特征。 通过创建越来越多的职务，王冠并没有提高其‘机构’的有效性，相反地，促进了职能竞争和职务持有者倾向于利用普遍性力量来确保自己利益的倾向。从这个意义上说，王室‘管理’与物质再生产的扩张处于某种矛盾中。鉴于职务财产的结构性重要性，由职务持有者（最常见的是，由总督们）颁布和实施的特定发展措施几乎无关紧要。 在英格兰，也有定期的闲职。然而，贵族没有财政特权，以及乡绅利益在议会的普遍化——连同对政府成本高昂做法的成功抵抗的可能性——意味着，如果王冠想为贵族提供收入，通常必须通过让他们参与其封建占有力量的‘管理’来实现。‘中央’政府的管理者得到定期薪水，以及宫廷职位的持有者。另一方面，地方政府主要由地方贵族代表和——在宗教改革后——英格兰教会的神职人员实施，他们没有从王冠那里得到支付。"},{"instruction":"请将“In England, too, certain offices were bought. This practice was most striking in the army. Here, however, the trade in commissions was more or less private. The crown did not offer commissions for sale, but distributed these among the clientele groups of influential nobles for political ends. The granting of offices helped to reduce the costs of policy, but was not a means of direct fiscal procurement; expansion of office-holding was consequently not an urgently necessary government practice. There was, indeed, in England an expansion of offices. It was most numerous in the eighteenth century in the realm of local administration, as the growth of the Commissions of the Peace meant that the demand for confirmation of noble rank was met by appointment as Justice of the Peace. This expansion, however, neither made government more expensive, nor did it produce, as was so often the case in France under the ancien régime, conflict between established local authorities and newly appointed royal officials. Certainly, this was not the only way of access to nobility, but in England too, dominant practices of advance were oriented to obtaining possession of royal power of office. The structural conditions for such strategies, however, were quite different from those in France. In England, no practice of unproductive investment developed like that in France. The office power of Justices of the Peace could in no way be bought; those offices that could be purchased were comparatively cheaper than in France, and there were far fewer of them. Finally, nothing like as much profit could be made from the crown's debts as was possible in France, owing to the limited nature of the crown's ‘apparatus' and to parliamentary participation in financial policy. Though nomination to the Commissions of the Peace was the pre-rogative of the crown, in actual fact the members of these commissions were chosen from locally dominant families, so that the institutionally confirmed hierarchy generally corresponded to locally dominant ideas of admission to the gentry in terms of wealth and behaviour. Election to the Commons was decisive for possible further advance within the nobility, and also lay in the decision of the locally established nobility. This pattern of recruitment meant that Justices of the Peace tended to be representative of their estate. This did not mean that they were unable to shape the conduct of their office according to personal conceptions, but they were repeatedly forced to pay attention to the views of their 'neighbours', i.e. local fellow members of their estate. In combination with regular Parliaments, this structure of local government led to the government of the country corresponding far more clearly with gen-eralised lordly interests - at least in comparison - than in a kingdom where the 'apparatus' of government institutionalised competing private interests of appropriation, and the selection of office-holders was not linked to locally generalised interests. This meant, for one thing, that in England the crown had little prospect of implementing for any length of time a policy that contradicted the locally generalised interests of the lords, and, for another, that changes in dominant reproduction strategies could not be politically blocked. The clearest example of the first point is supplied by the dynastic and religious policy of Charles I, and the clearest example of the second by the unsuccessful attempts of governments to prevent enclosures and other practices that destroyed the reproduction possibilities of small peasants. The comparatively weaker state 'apparatus' in England, along with a system of taxation that was not, like the French, tied to the maintenance of independent small peasants, made the development of capitalist production easier in England. The revolutionary abolition of the royal right to grant privileges also worked in the same sense. In the process of revolutionising the generalised monarchical power, the feudal claims of the king on his 'tenants' were abolished, and along with them the offices for the 'administration' of fiefs. The surviving sinecures were not a major source of grievance. The sums that families of the high nobility in particular acquired from sinecures, according to later critical publications, do not alter the fact that the centralised power of appropriation had been to a great extent de-privatised since the turn of the eighteenth century. The government 'apparatus' did not stand in the way of structural changes in appropriation. This however was precisely the situation in France. Whilst 'state' regulation of economic life improved the income opportunities of office-holders, it could not bring about here the development of manufacturing or an expansion in the volume of trade. The repressive tax system of the seventeenth century accelerated monetarisation and commodity production, since peasants were forced to sell grain even if this left them without enough to eat or to sow. Structurally, however, this change in economic structure led in France to a crisis-prone stabilising of already existing investment structures. Since the tax system made investment in office power and state loans more lucrative, investment in other fields long remained relatively less attractive. In the eighteenth century, the prospects of profit in the colonial trade and in com-mercialised agriculture led to shifts in the structure of investment, which also had an influence on manufacturing production. But the revolutionising of appropriation was blocked by the structural weight of appropriation through office, through privilege (especially seigneurial power) and the state debt. It is not by mere chance, therefore, that in all societies of the ancien-régime type, ‘the power of the state, the concentrated and organised force of society' is deployed ‘to hasten, as in a hothouse, the process of transformation [. . .] into the capitalist mode, and to shorten the transition,' as Marx put it in his discussion of primitive accumulation in Volume 1 of Capital,1 a process that Marxist historiography has subsequently referred to as ‘absolutism'. The precondition for this ‘hastening' was the abolition or at least limitation of centralised appropriation for the purpose of private enrichment. The most general form of the bourgeois state, the separation of politics from economics, is not the structural consequence of the domination of capitalist relations, but, rather, the precondition for it. Structural change in the rule of the high nobility England under the ancien régime had an unambiguous social hierarchy. This stretched from ‘plain gentlemen', through the ‘county gentry' whose members frequently counted themselves among the ‘armigerous gentry', up to the ‘peerage'. Within the peerage again, the rank order of titles largely followed achieved social rank. Through to the very last phase of the English ancien régime, the age of the great reforms of the nineteenth century, there were repeated differences of interest between the high nobility and the gentry, and between the court - i.e. a section of the peerage - and the country - members of the higher gentry whose orientation was predominantly local. In the course of time, however, the high nobility were deprived of their special means of rule by the successful opposition of the gentry and the urban bourgeoisie, starting with their inde-pendent armed force and their de facto control of the royal judicial instances - practices that were described as affinity, livery and maintenance. From the sixteenth century on, only membership of the House of Lords survived as a special possession of rule. Moreover, the high nobility's opportunities of power - which remained considerable even after the revolutions of the seventeenth century - had to be realised in practice: by patronage, i.e. the conveyance or brokerage of offices, by the offer of money, and in general by modes of behaviour that succeeded in achieving and maintaining local precedence and influence at court. The English high nobility arose as a service nobility of the king. It retained this structure through the entire duration of the ancien régime. There were no formalised claims to office, but service to the king or queen was seen not just as ennobling, but as actually appropriate to noble status. If the peerage, in the phase of its historical constitution, had been the supporting group of the ideal of (military) honour, families of the high nobility (though by no means all of them) participated also in the ‘civil' ruling practice of the crown, and equally in the competition for influence and power. They remained, in other words, the politically, materially and culturally dominant stratum of society. If, however, peers sought not just to live off their wealth and the traditions of their family, but to actually demonstrate their lordly claim before a wider public, they were forced to pay heed to the views and interests of the gentry. Political power in England had, in the last instance, to be demonstrated by influence on parliamentary decisions. This was already the case before 1649, and still more clearly so after 1688-9. Though many (‘closed') constituencies remained de facto in the possession of particular noble families, those nobles out for political influence had to pursue a systematic patronage policy and expend considerable financial resources in order to achieve and maintain positions of local power, and they could not completely override the interests of their electors. As governments started to tie to themselves those peers who commanded several constituencies, by endowing them with (higher) titles, the hierarchy of noble ranks was brought still further in line with that of pos-sessions and political power. The greater the latter was, the more privileged was access to material participation in centralised appropriation, either in the form of offices for one's own family, or else in successful brokerage for one's clientele. This is not to suggest that the English peerage possessed special abilities of adapting to the changing conditions of competition for political power. It is to maintain, on the one hand, that strict primogeniture, along with firmly anchored marriage patterns, managed largely to secure the wealth of families of the high nobility, while, on the other hand, the English high nobility - apart from its hereditary membership of Parliament - had no specific legally guar-anteed ruling competences at its disposal. It was forced, therefore, to realise its opportunities of rule in strategies that took cognisance of changed conditions - such as, for example, the increase in the power of Justices of the Peace in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This course was not followed by all members of the high nobility - which comprised, at most, some sixty or so families - nor by all members of the county gentry, but it was followed by a sufficient number that the unity of estate hierarchy and actual political influ-ence was largely maintained through to the nineteenth century.”翻译为中文","output":"在英格兰，某些职位也是通过购买获得的。这种做法在军队中最为显著。然而，这里的官职买卖或多或少是私下进行的。王冠没有出售官职，而是基于政治目的在有影响力的贵族的客户群中分配这些官职。授予职位有助于降低政策成本，但不是直接财政采购的手段；因此，扩大官职持有并非政府的紧迫必要做法。的确，在英格兰存在官职的扩大。18世纪在地方行政领域的官职最为众多，随着和平委员会的增长意味着确认贵族等级的需求通过任命为和平法官得到满足。然而，这种扩张既没有使政府支出增加，也没有像在法国古代制度下那样经常产生已建立的地方权力机构和新任命的王室官员之间的冲突。当然，这不是通往贵族身份的唯一途径，但在英格兰，主导的晋升做法也是致力于获得王权职位的占有。然而，此类策略的结构条件与法国大不相同。在英格兰，没有像法国那样发展出非生产性投资的做法。和平法官的职权绝不能购买；可以购买的那些职位与法国相比价格较低，而且数量远少。最后，由于王冠“机构”的限制性和议会对财政政策的参与，无法从王冠债务中获得与法国相比如此多的利润。尽管任命和平委员会的成员是王冠的特权，实际上这些委员会的成员是从地方上占主导地位的家族中选出的，因此机构认证的等级序列通常与地方上关于贵族身份的接纳标准（在财富和行为方面）相符。能否进一步晋升贵族阶层，在英格兰的最终决定权在于地方既定贵族，并取决于是否被选入下议院。这种招募模式意味着和平法官往往代表他们的阶层。这并不意味着他们无法根据个人观念塑造其职务的行为，但他们反复被迫注意到他们的“邻居”即地方同阶层成员的观点。结合定期召开的议会，这一地方政府结构使国家治理更加清晰地符合一般化的领主利益——至少相比之下——而不是在一个政府“机构”制度化了私有占有利益的竞争，且官员选拔未与地方一般化的利益相联系的王国。这意味着，一方面，在英格兰，王冠实施任何违背地方一般化领主利益的政策的前景都很渺茫，另一方面，支配性再生产策略的变化不能被政治上阻止。第一点最明显的例子是查理一世的王朝和宗教政策，第二点最明显的例子则是政府试图阻止圈地和其他破坏小农再生产可能性的做法的失败尝试。英格兰相对较弱的国家“机构”，以及不像法国那样与维护独立小农相联系的税收制度，使得资本主义生产在英格兰更易发展。革命性废除了王室授予特权的权利也同样起到了作用。在革命化君主制通用化权力的过程中，废除了国王对其“佃户”的封建要求，以及与之相关的“管理”职位。幸存的闲职没有成为重大的不满来源。高等贵族特别是通过闲职获得的金额，根据后来的批评性出版物，并不改变自18世纪初以来集中占有权力在很大程度上已经去私有化的事实。政府“机构”没有阻碍占有权的结构性变化。 然而，法国的情况正是如此。尽管“国家”对经济生活的规制提高了官员的收入机会，但它并未能在这里促进制造业发展或贸易量的扩增。17世纪压迫性的税收制度加速了货币化和商品生产，因为农民被迫出卖粮食，即使这会使他们没有足够的食物吃或种植。但从结构上讲，这种经济结构的变化在法国导致了对已有投资结构的危机倾向性稳定化。由于税收制度使得投资于官职权力和国家贷款更具吸引力，投资于其他领域长期以来相对较少吸引人。到了18世纪，殖民贸易和商业化农业的利润前景导致了投资结构的变化，这也对制造业生产产生了影响。但通过官职、特权（尤其是领主权）和国家债务的占有方式的革命化受到了阻碍。因此，不是偶然的，在所有古代制度类型的社会中，“国家的权力，社会集中且组织化的力量”被部署为“加速这一转变过程[...] 到资本主义方式，并缩短过渡期”，正如马克思在《资本论》第一卷讨论原始积累时所说的，马克思主义史学后来称之为“绝对主义”。这种“加速”的前提是废除或至少限制集中占有的目的是私人富裕。资产阶级国家的最一般形式，政治与经济的分离，不是资本主义关系支配的结构性后果，而是它的前提条件。 高等贵族统治的结构性变化 古代制度下的英格兰有一个明确的社会等级制度。这从“普通绅士”延伸至经常认为自己属于“持武士头衔的绅士”的“郡绅士”，直到“贵族”。在贵族之中，头衔的等级序列在很大程度上遵循着达成的社会地位。 直到英格兰古代制度的最后阶段，即19世纪的大改革时期，高等贵族和乡绅之间，以及宫廷（即贵族阶层的一部分）和乡村（以地方为主导的高级乡绅成员）之间经常存在利益差异。然而，随着时间的推移，高等贵族被剥夺了它们的特殊统治手段，这得益于乡绅和城市资产阶级的成功反对，从它们的独立武装力量和事实上对皇家司法实例的控制开始——这些做法被描述为亲和力、制服和维护。从16世纪开始，作为统治特权的唯一存活下来的是作为上议院成员。此外，即使在17世纪的革命之后高等贵族的权力机会仍然相当大，这些机会也必须实际实现：通过赞助，即职位的传递或中介，通过提供金钱，以及一般通过成功实现并维持地方优先权和在宫廷的影响力的行为模式。 英格兰高等贵族作为国王的服务贵族而兴起。它在整个古代制度期间保留了这一结构。没有正式的职位要求，但服务于国王或女王不仅被视为赋予爵位的行为，而且实际上被认为适合贵族地位。如果说贵族在其历史形成阶段是（军事）荣誉理想的支持群体，那么高等贵族的家族（尽管不是所有家族）也参与了王冠的“文民”统治实践，同样参与了影响力和权力的竞争。换句话说，他们仍然是社会上政治、物质和文化上的主导阶层。 然而，如果贵族寻求的不仅是依靠他们的财富和家族传统生活，而是在更广泛的公众面前实际展示他们的领主身份，他们就不得不注意乡绅的观点和利益。在英格兰，政治权力在最后实例中必须通过影响议会决议来展示。这在1649年之前就是如此，1688-9年之后更是如此。尽管许多（“封闭”的）选区事实上仍然为特定的贵族家族所拥有，但那些追求政治影响力的贵族必须采取系统的赞助政策，并投入大量财务资源以实现并维持地方权力地位，他们不能完全忽视他们选民的利益。随着政府开始将控制多个选区的贵族通过授予（更高）头衔与自己联系起来，贵族等级的层次与财产和政治权力的层次进一步对齐。后者越大，接近中心集权占有的物质参与就越有特权，无论是为自己的家族获得职位，还是为客户群成功地进行中介。 这并不是说英格兰贵族拥有适应政治权力竞争变化条件的特殊能力。一方面，严格的长子继承制，加上牢固的婚姻模式，大体上能够确保高等贵族家族的财富安全，而另一方面，除了其遗传的议会成员资格外，英格兰高等贵族没有特定的法律保障的统治能力。因此，它被迫在认识到条件变化——例如，16世纪和17世纪和平法官权力的增加——的策略中实现其统治机会。不是所有高等贵族家族——最多也就六十个左右家族——或所有郡绅都采取了这一策略，但足够多的人采取了这一策略，使得到19世纪，通过贵族阶层的统一和实际政治影响力，维持了阶层等级和实际政治影响力的大致一致。"},{"instruction":"请将“In France, the date of a family's nobility was always the key criterion of social rank. Certainly, this criterion could not be asserted against the immedi-ate relatives of the royal family or the dignity of dukes, but below the ducs et pairs, anyone whose family could prove that they had been noble since the thirteenth century, and especially since the eleventh, viewed themselves as more eminent than a minister or even the royal secretaries, immensely rich though these might be. This hierarchy of precedence, and the threats it faced, was a key structural feature of the French nobility. Though the reproduction of lordly status, especially for the territorially powerful nobility, had been largely maintained for centuries by material participation in royal taxation, and though many families of the noblesse d'épée were forced by material cir-cumstances to have successive generations serve the king as officers, this nobility kept independence from the king's service as a dominant content of their self-conception, and were therefore not ready to acknowledge that such service, even in a position of great responsibility, could grant the same nobility as previously powerful families had won by their male members' serving the king with their swords. Among families of the noblesse d'épée, there was a widespread tendency to class their own nobility as high and that of the robe as low. This conception, however, broke down on the differences that opened up between the hierarchy of précédence, that of wealth and that of political power. As far as both wealth and power were concerned, the topmost strata of the noblesse de robe had already overtaken the lower reaches of the noblesse d'épée in the course of the seventeenth century. The high nobility thus comprised, at least by the eighteenth century, the top strata of the noblesse d'épée and the top strata of the noblesse de robe. Though contemporaries continued to ascribe particular families to one or other noble grouping, the former 'professional' distinctions increasingly disappeared. There were families of the noblesse d'épée whose members performed high judicial and administrative offices, and offspring of the robe who became officers in the army. At the same time, social and marriage connections were made across this divide, initially in the provinces. Yet the high nobility of France, differently from the English peerage, was not a more or less unitary reservoir - organised into clientele groups - from which the kings could recruit their servants. The previously considerable possession of relatively autonomous territorial rule, and participation of the ducs et pairs in the Fronde of the seventeenth century, led the royal government to an attitude of political reserve vis-à-vis this leading group of nobles. After the Fronde, the pairs lost their claim to membership of the royal council, while the office of gouverneur, which remained reserved to members of the high nobility, gave only limited competence. Implemented in the second half of the seventeenth century, the political disempowerment of the high nobility remained from then on a structural feature of the French ancien régime. The failure of noble government during the minority of Louis XV put the final seal on this state of affairs. Particular members of this group continued to have great political influence; but this was no longer based on their rank, but rather on the confidence that the king placed in them. The political disempowerment of the ducs et pairs brought their official mode of existence dangerously close to that of the group within the families accepted at court who were described as courtiers. Courtiers enriched themselves from offices that had no significance outside of court ceremonial, and reduced politics to cabals. They sought neither the traditional legitimisation of noble rule, the ideal of honour, nor the newly emerging eighteenth-century ideal of virtue and service. Critical writings of the time describe them as puffed-up drones, the living embodiment of every evil. Even if the court nobility comprised only a section of the high nobility, and courtiers made up an even smaller group of those families admitted to court, the key place that court ceremonial assumed in the governing practice of French kings from Louis XIV onwards made it highly significant that those nobles who stood at the apex of their hierarchy by virtue of their admission to court, lived in a manner that contradicted the dominant ideas of value. Below the court nobility was a stratum of rule that Bailey Stone has described as the 'robinocracy'. These, in a certain sense, administered the royal power and determined new accessions to the upper strata of the noblesse de robe. The same can pretty well be said of the effect of English patronage practices. Yet, there were considerable differences between the two. On the one hand, offices in France were the hereditary property of individuals, while in England, though the important office power of Justice of the Peace was often 'inherited' in certain families for a long while, renewal and transmission of office always remained dependent both on the agreement of locally dominant families, and on that of the crown. The realisation of political power, since this was linked with parliamentary majorities, required that newly arising families be taken into account in patronage practices according to their local esteem. In actual fact, the social limitations of access to office power in England were very likely just as great as in France. But the criterion of access of a family's length of nobility - initially conventional and later actually fixed in law - provoked conflicts in France that had no counterpart in England. In England, families that could no longer fulfil the material preconditions for competition with newly ascendant families inevitably fell out of this competition sooner of later, whilst in France they successfully insisted on their social precedence being protected. On top of this, though in England, availability for service to the king was certainly a key criterion for membership of the gentry, this did not necessarily have to be realised in actual office-holding. In both kingdoms, nobles in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries stood at the peak of the hierarchy of wealth and at the peak of the king's 'officials', but in England the hierarchy of power and possessions largely coincided with the hierarchy of noble rank, whilst in France this was not the case either at the peak of the noblesse d'épée nor in its lower ranks. Estate hierarchy and distribution of wealth In France, it could happen that a very old and thus very eminent family of the noblesse d'épée continued to enjoy seigneurial judicial competence even though it could no longer compete in terms of wealth with certain peasant families, to whom it might even have leased seigneurial rights. Father and sons might have regularly buckled on their swords, and mothers and daughters rightfully expected the respectful greeting of Sunday churchgoers, but it did not remain unnoticed that the number of their servants was reduced, that they no longer sent out widespread invitations, and that their daughters had to accept being married without a dowry. By the end of the ancien régime, some 11,000 noble families are supposed to have lived in material conditions that did not allow for any kind of luxury, scarcely any servants, no dinner parties and only rarely even new frocks for the ladies. A further 5,000 families were actually impoverished, and some nobles had even sunk into destitution.2 Leaving aside this category, almost all noble families disposed of seigneurial rights that could be used for appropriation, i.e. they were still in a dominant class position over many peasant families, labourers and even townsmen. This did not necessarily make them part of the materially dominant strata. For, in the course of the ancien régime, the unity of estate membership and economic dominance had increasingly dissolved. The richest in the land continued to be noble, and the poorest in the land were noble only in exceptional cases. But, in the middle strata of wealth and access to class-type power of appropriation, social rank did not necessarily correspond to material position. Right to the end of the ancien régime, wealth in France brought access to nobility by pur-chase of an office or letters patent (no one was ennobled who did not possess the means to live a noble life; even those ennoblements that rewarded services cost 6,000 livres for the registration of letters patent, not to mention the costs required to bring a person's services to the king's attention), but - apart from the purchase of the office of a royal secretary - ennoblement only granted ‘nobility in waiting'. Whilst service was increasingly respected in the second half of the eighteenth century, this did not go so far as to displace the criteria of length of nobility in determining social rank. It was indeed the case, in France, that the crown's control of defining the social hierarchy was more extensive than in England, yet its reach was not so great that it could distribute social ranks according to political power within the ruling estate. To this extent, the hierarchy of social ranks within the nobility remained contested, despite all the connections between families of the ‘sword' and the 'robe'. Still more relevant is the fact that the guarantee (in effect almost unconditional) of permanence of nobility once acquired caused the estate hierarchy sanctioned by the ruling power to depart in certain areas from the hierarchy of material position. This, together with the fact that the noble hierarchy was represented in court ceremonial in a manner that scorned the emerging ideal of virtue, led to a situation in which noble ranks lost their unambiguous anchorage in socially prevailing values - though they certainly remained attractive. ”翻译为中文","output":"在法国，一个家族贵族身份的日期始终是社会等级的关键标准。当然，这一标准无法对抗王室直系亲属或公爵的尊严，但在公爵和贵族之下，任何能证明自己的家族自13世纪以来，尤其是自11世纪以来就已贵族化的人，都认为自己比部长甚至皇家秘书更为显贵，尽管后者可能富有无比。这一优先权等级制度及其所面临的威胁是法国贵族的一个关键结构特征。尽管领主地位的延续，特别是对于拥有领土的贵族而言，在很大程度上几个世纪以来都是通过参与王家税收而得以维持的，尽管许多剑贵族家族因物质环境的限制而被迫让子孙辈辈为王服役，但这一贵族依然将独立于国王服务作为他们自我认识的主要内容，并因此不愿承认，即便是担任重要职位的服务也能赋予和先前那些通过用剑为王服务的强大家族所赢得的相同的贵族身份。在剑贵族家族中，普遍存在将自己的贵族身份视为高贵而将袍贵族视为低贵的倾向。然而，这一观念在既有的优先权等级制度、财富等级制度以及政治权力等级制度之间的分歧中瓦解了。就财富和权力而言，到了17世纪，袍贵族的最高阶层已经超过了剑贵族的下层。因此，至少到了18世纪，高贵族已经包括了剑贵族和袍贵族的顶层。尽管当时的人们继续将特定的家族归入某个贵族群体，但之前的“职业”区别日益消失。有些剑贵族的成员担任高级司法和行政职务，而一些袍贵族的后代则成为了军官。同时，这一分隔的两侧开始在初期在省份建立社交和婚姻联系。然而，法国的高贵族与英格兰的贵族阶级不同，并不是一个或多或少统一的团体——组织成客户群体——国王可以从中招募仆人。此前相对独立的领土统治权的相当大的占有量，以及17世纪贵族联盟（Fronde）中公爵和贵族的参与，导致王室政府对这一领导贵族群体采取政治上的保留态度。在贵族联盟之后，贵族失去了成为王室议会成员的权利，而仅限于高贵族成员的gouverneur职位也只提供了有限的权限。17世纪下半叶实施的高贵族的政治削弱从那时起一直是法国古代制度的一个结构特征。在路易十五未成年期间贵族政府的失败为这一状态画上了句号。这一群体的特定成员继续拥有巨大的政治影响力；但这不再基于他们的等级，而是基于国王对他们的信赖。公爵和贵族的政治削弱使他们的官方生活方式危险地接近于那些被接纳入宫廷的家族中被称为宫廷侍臣的群体。宫廷侍臣通过毫无意义的官职致富，这些官职在宫廷仪式之外毫无意义，并将政治简化为小团体的争斗。他们既不寻求贵族统治的传统合法化，也不寻求荣誉理想，更不寻求新兴的18世纪的美德和服务理想。当时的批判性作品将他们描述为虚张声势的无所事事者，是一切邪恶的活体化身。即使宫廷贵族只包含了高贵族的一部分，且宫廷侍臣在被接纳入宫廷的家族中占更小的比例，但从路易十四时代起法国国王的治理实践中宫廷仪式所占的核心地位，使那些凭借宫廷入场权站在贵族层级顶端的贵族，其生活方式与占主导地位的价值观念相矛盾，显得非常重要。 在宫廷贵族之下是一个被Bailey Stone描述为\\"robinocracy\\"的统治阶层。在某种意义上，他们管理着王家的权力并决定袍贵族上层的新成员加入。英格兰的赞助做法也基本如此。然而，两者之间存在着显著差异。一方面，法国的官职是个人的世袭财产，而在英格兰，尽管重要的官职权力——和平法官——在某些家族中经常“世袭”很长时间，但官职的更新和传递始终既依赖于当地占主导地位的家族的同意，也依赖于王室的同意。政治权力的实现，既然与议会多数派挂钩，就要求在赞助做法中根据其地方声望考虑新兴的家族。实际上，英格兰进入官职权力的社会限制很可能与法国一样大。但家族贵族身份的历史长短——最初是习俗上的，后来实际上在法律中固定——在法国引发的冲突在英格兰无对应物。在英格兰，那些再也无法满足与新崛起的家族竞争的物质前提条件的家族，不可避免地早晚会退出这场竞争，而在法国，他们成功地坚持要求保护他们的社会地位优先权。此外，尽管在英格兰，为国王服务的可用性当然是成为乡绅成员的一个关键标准，但这并不一定必须在实际的官职中实现。在17世纪和18世纪的两个王国中，贵族处于财富层次结构和国王“官员”的顶峰，但在英格兰，权力和财富的层次结构与贵族等级的层次结构在很大程度上一致，而在法国，无论在剑贵族的顶层还是其下层都不是这种情况。 地产等级和财富分配 在法国，很有可能一个非常古老因而非常显贵的剑贵族家族继续享有领主司法权，即使它在财富方面已经无法与某些农民家族竞争，而且可能还将领主权出租给了他们。父亲和儿子们可能定期佩剑，而母亲和女儿们理所当然地期待周日教堂礼拜者的尊敬问候，但人们并未忽视他们的仆人数量减少，不再发出广泛的邀请，且女儿们不得不接受无嫁妆的婚姻这一事实。到古代制度结束时，大约有11,000个贵族家庭生活在物质条件下，几乎没有任何奢侈，很少有仆人，没有宴会，女士们甚至很少有新裙子。另外5,000个家庭实际上已经贫困，一些贵族甚至陷入了贫穷。撇开这一类别不谈，几乎所有的贵族家庭都拥有可用于占有的领主权，即他们仍然在许多农民家庭、劳工甚至城镇居民上占据主导的阶级地位。这并不一定使他们成为物质主导阶层的一部分。因为，在整个古代制度期间，地产成员资格和经济主导地位的统一性日益解体。土地上最富有的人继续是贵族，而土地上最贫穷的人只在特殊情况下是贵族。但是，在财富中等层次和获得阶级型占有权力的准入方面，社会等级并不一定对应于物质地位。直到古代制度结束时，财富在法国通过购买职位或颁发专利信函带来了贵族身份的准入（没有人会被授予贵族身份，除非他拥有过贵族生活的手段；即使是奖励服务的授予贵族身份也需要支付6,000里弗的专利信函注册费，更不用说将个人的服务引起国王注意的费用了），但除了购买皇家秘书职位外，授予贵族身份只能获得“候选贵族身份”。尽管在18世纪下半叶服务日益受到尊重，但这并未到达取代贵族身份历史长短作为决定社会等级标准的地步。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

from the usable elements of the NRA and what's left of the Beiyang Army. One year after this, the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] is restored in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China as the post-1915, pre-1916 unitary parliamentary democratic imperial royal monarchy of the Empire of China founded and lead by Qing general turned first President of the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China and then one-time Emperor of China Yuan Shikai, albiet with the Imperial House of Zhu in charge instead of Shikai's descendants via a referendum by the Chinese people and also by legislation passed by the restored National Assembly. The restored Ming dynasty is still formally known as the \\"Republic of China\\" in English despite having the name of the Empire of China in Chinese like the Empire of China founded and led by Yuan Shikai's Empire of China. Manchuria breaks away from China in the late stages of the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in China via the revival of the Beiyang Government in China due to Manchu and Han units of the NRA loyal to the Manchu Qing imperial court still operating in Manchuria before the Northern Expedition defecting to Manchuria and using captured Soviet, American and NRA equipment to defend Manchuria against Kai-Shek loyalists in Han China and the Soviets with the covert help of Imperial Japan, with the Fengtian Clique being restored as the government of Manchuria, albiet with the Qing imperial court in charge of the restored Fengtian Clique instead of Xueliang's eldest son, Martin with the last Qing Emperor, \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, taking Xueliang and his [Xueliang's] now-dead father's, the Manchuria-based Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman in the Manchurian military system and then leader of the Fengtian Clique, Zhang Zhuolin's [Zhuolin] known as [Zhuolin's more famous alias] \\"the Old Marshall\\" roles as [what roles Pu-Yi took from both Zhuolin and Xueliang] unofficial warlord of Manchuria and Generallismo of the Fengtian Clique, with these roles [unofficial warlord of Manchuria and Generallismo of the Fengtian Clique] eventually being merged into the unofficial position of Emperor of Manchuria. This restored Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria is known as the Empire of Manchuria or more popularly as Manchukuo, with Xueliang being presented as a regent for the restoration of the monarchy [the Qing Empire and the Qing imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro] in Manchuria who had gone rouge and aligned himself [Xueliang] with Soviet communists and Soviet dictator, Josef Stalin's puppet government [Nationalist China] in China. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] allows the secession of Manchuria due to it [the restored Ming dynasty] needing to consolidate control over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, although Nationalist China is later restored in its [Nationalist China's] stronghold of Cantonia as the independent Cantonian Republic of the South China Republic, as the restored Legislative Yuan in the South China Republic votes to remove Kai-Shek, who [Kai-Shek] had escaped to the USSR with the help of NKVD and Soviet Red Army survivors in Han China and [Kai-Shek] was living lavishly in Moscow on the Cantonese, Chinese and Manchurian people's money stolen during his [Kai-Shek's] escape from Han China, [the restored Legislative Yuan voting to remove Kai-Shek from power] and hold free and fair democratic elections via secret ballot. Imperial Japan makes the Qing imperial court-ruled restored Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and the restored Ming dynasty in Manchuria into protectorates in order to secure itself [Imperial Japan] against Soviet-controlled Mongolia, the USSR, and American aggression [Japan] also making the restored Nationalist China in Cantonia into a protectorate, [Imperial Japan] later making the restored Nationalist China in Cantonia into a restored post-1661, pre-1683 Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled satellite kingdom/tributary state/rump kingdom of the Tungning Kingdom in order to both satisfy its [Imperial Japan's] goal of Pan-Asian monarchism and [Imperial Japan] also prevent any further anti-Japanese incidents in the region. Due to the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty being [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] a nativized Taiwanese with strong influences from the Ming dynasty side branch of the Japanese Imperial Family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty due to the founder of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty's founder, the scholar-offical under the Ming dynasty turned general in the Great Ming Army and pirate Zheng Chenggong, having the princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty Minamoto Matsu as his [Chenggong's] mother, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty with the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands being absorbed into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royalty. The division of the three main nations of the China region [Cantonia, Han China and Manchuria] into independent nations prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War between Imperial Japan and the Beiyang Government and Nationalist China, the USSR and the USA and thus allows the Beiyang Government, independent Manchuria and Nationalist China to all survive post-1947 into the 21th century and beyond.","output":"In an alternate history scenario surrounding the events following the Northern Expedition (1926-1928) led by Chiang Kai-Shek under the Kuomintang (KMT), several significant divergences result in a drastically different 20th and 21st centuries for China. After the Northern Expedition, the KMT establishes a totalitarian military dictatorship in Cantonia, governing through a party-state system that prioritizes allegiance to the KMT above the state. This leads to a unified Nationalist China briefly, before internal and external factions lead to seismic shifts in power. A coalition consisting of the Yellow Sand Society, the Young China Party (YCP), remnants of the Beiyang and National Pacification Armies, and elements of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), orchestrated a coup that dissolves the Nationalist Chinese government, reinstating the Beiyang Government. This group, fueled by disillusionment with the KMT and foreign intervention, calls for the restoration of the Ming dynasty but ultimately reinstates the Beiyang Government with military regency support and anti-KMT factions. A year later, the Ming dynasty is ostensibly restored, not as a traditional monarchy but under the guise of a republic similar to the short-lived Empire of China founded by Yuan Shikai. However, this \\"restored\\" state, still officially called the Republic of China, faces a secession by Manchuria. Manchuria, reverting to the Qing imperial court's rule under the name Manchukuo, breaks away with the help of defecting NRA units and foreign support, including covert aid from Imperial Japan. The restored Ming administration, focusing on consolidating power in the Han heartland, allows Manchuria's secession. Meanwhile, Nationalist China is reborn as the Cantonian Republic in the south, removing Chiang Kai-Shek from power and embracing democratic elections. Imperial Japan, seizing the opportunity presented by regional instability, establishes protectorates over both Manchukuo and the restored Ming dynasty and later over the Cantonian Republic, ultimately transforming the latter into a satellite state reminiscent of the Tungning Kingdom. This maneuver aims to bolster Japan's Pan-Asian monarchist agenda and safeguard against Soviet and American influences. The division of China into three distinct nations — the Cantonian Republic, the restored Ming dynasty in Mainland China, and Manchukuo — prevents the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, fundamentally altering the region's trajectory and ensuring the survival of these states into the 21st century. This scenario envisions a world where historical grievances and power dynamics are reinterpreted through the lens of monarchism, national identity, and international manipulation, creating a complex tapestry of interdependent but sovereign states navigating a landscape shaped by past divisions and new alliances."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and elements of the Beiyang Army and National Pacification Army who refused to demoblize after the Northern Expedition, with the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army slaughtering units of the Soviet Union's combined armed forces, the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and of the US combined armed forces, the US Armed Forces, working together to protect the Nationalist Chinese government along with operatives of the combined Soviet federal law enforcement agency, domestic secret police agency and foreign intelligence service, the NKVD and the WW2-era American foreign intelligence service, the Office of Strategic Services, helping the Nationalist Chinese military intelligence agency devoted to intelligence gathering and covert spying operation for purposes of national security and defense, having a great influence amongst the Nationalist Chinese military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad, involved in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics hunt down anti-Soviet and anti-American dissidents in China after the Northern Expedition, while the YCP helps the NPA and Beiyang Army remnants along with the Yellow Sand Society storm the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan in Nationalist China's capital of Nanking and [the

thus the first Republic of China's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and House of Representatives, the National Assembly with Xueliang being [Xueliang] executed as a traitor for his [Xueliang's] collaboration with Kai-Shek and the Soviets after the Northern Expedition, after the restoration of the Beiyang Government as the government of China, [ the NPA and Beiyang Army remnants

Kuomingtang for the restoration of the Ming as the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army along with the NPA and Beiyang Army hunt down and eliminate Kai-Shek loyalists within the Kuomingtang, NRA and the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics who refuse to accept the return of the legitimate Chinese democratic government [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] with the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics itself being [the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics] reformed [the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics] into a modern day version of the Imperial secret police that served the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China that was also a imperial military body, with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives along with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives, and also to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them without trial and punishing them, without going through due process, whose members were bound to the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China and took direct orders from them [the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China], also serving as political commissary of the Great Ming State's combined ground combat force and naval warfare force, the Great Ming Army in times of war, the Jǐnyīwèi [brocade-clothing guard/Embroidered Uniform Guard] as the Great Ming Army itself is restored from the usable elements of the NRA and what's left of the Beiyang Army. One year after this, the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] is restored in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China as the post-1915, pre-1916 unitary parliamentary democratic imperial royal monarchy of the Empire of China founded and lead by Qing general turned first President of the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China and then one-time Emperor of China Yuan Shikai, albiet with the Imperial House of Zhu in charge instead of Shikai's descendants via a referendum by the Chinese people and also by legislation passed by the restored National Assembly. The restored Ming dynasty is still formally known as the \\"Republic of China\\" in English despite having the name of the Empire of China in Chinese like the Empire of China founded and led by Yuan Shikai's Empire of China. Manchuria breaks away from China in the late stages of the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] in China via the revival of the Beiyang Government in China due to Manchu and Han units of the NRA loyal to the Manchu Qing imperial court still operating in Manchuria before the Northern Expedition defecting to Manchuria and using captured Soviet, American and NRA equipment to defend Manchuria against Kai-Shek loyalists in Han China and the Soviets with the covert help of Imperial Japan, with the Fengtian Clique being restored as the government of Manchuria, albiet with the Qing imperial court in charge of the restored Fengtian Clique instead of Xueliang's eldest son, Martin with the last Qing Emperor, \\"Henry\\" Pu-Yi, taking Xueliang and his [Xueliang's] now-dead father's, the Manchuria-based Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman in the Manchurian military system and then leader of the Fengtian Clique, Zhang Zhuolin's [Zhuolin] known as [Zhuolin's more famous alias] \\"the Old Marshall\\" roles as [what roles Pu-Yi took from both Zhuolin and Xueliang] unofficial warlord of Manchuria and Generallismo of the Fengtian Clique, with these roles [unofficial warlord of Manchuria and Generallismo of the Fengtian Clique] eventually being merged into the unofficial position of Emperor of Manchuria. This restored Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria is known as the Empire of Manchuria or more popularly as Manchukuo, with Xueliang being presented as a regent for the restoration of the monarchy [the Qing Empire and the Qing imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro] in Manchuria who had gone rouge and aligned himself [Xueliang] with Soviet communists and Soviet dictator, Josef Stalin's puppet government [Nationalist China] in China. The restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] allows the secession of Manchuria due to it [the restored Ming dynasty] needing to consolidate control over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty, although Nationalist China is later restored in its [Nationalist China's] stronghold of Cantonia as the independent Cantonian Republic of the South China Republic, as the restored Legislative Yuan in the South China Republic votes to remove Kai-Shek, who [Kai-Shek] had escaped to the USSR with the help of NKVD and Soviet Red Army survivors in Han China and [Kai-Shek] was living lavishly in Moscow on the Cantonese, Chinese and Manchurian people's money stolen during his [Kai-Shek's] escape from Han China, [the restored Legislative Yuan voting to remove Kai-Shek from power] and hold free and fair democratic elections via secret ballot. Imperial Japan makes the Qing imperial court-ruled restored Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and the restored Ming dynasty in Manchuria into protectorates in order to secure itself [Imperial Japan] against Soviet-controlled Mongolia, the USSR, and American aggression [Japan] also making the restored Nationalist China in Cantonia into a protectorate, [Imperial Japan] later making the restored Nationalist China in Cantonia into a restored post-1661, pre-1683 Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled satellite kingdom/tributary state/rump kingdom of the Tungning Kingdom in order to both satisfy its [Imperial Japan's] goal of Pan-Asian monarchism and [Imperial Japan] also prevent any further anti-Japanese incidents in the region. Due to the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty being [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] a nativized Taiwanese with strong influences from the Ming dynasty side branch of the Japanese Imperial Family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty due to the founder of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty's founder, the scholar-offical under the Ming dynasty turned general in the Great Ming Army and pirate Zheng Chenggong, having the princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty Minamoto Matsu as his [Chenggong's] mother, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty with the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands being absorbed into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royalty. The division of the three main nations of the China region [Cantonia, Han China and Manchuria] into independent nations prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War between Imperial Japan and the Beiyang Government and Nationalist China, the USSR and the USA and thus allows the Beiyang Government, independent Manchuria and Nationalist China to all survive post-1947 into the 21th century and beyond.","output":"In this alternate history scenario, the Kuomintang (KMT)-led National Government of the Republic of China, guided by the principles of Sun Yat-Sen and under the leadership of Chiang Kai-Shek, successfully unifies China through the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928. This campaign results in the defeat of the Beiyang Government and the Fengtian Clique, incorporating their territories into a KMT-dominated China. The narrative further evolves with the Yellow Sand Society and the Young China Party, allied with remnants of the Beiyang Army and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), instigating a coup against the KMT government. This leads to the dissolution of the KMT government at gunpoint and the restoration of the Beiyang Government, ruling under a military regency with the aim of restoring the Ming dynasty. A year later, the monarchy is reinstated through a referendum, with the Ming dynasty formally restored but still known as the \\"Republic of China\\" in English, despite adopting the name of the Empire of China in Chinese. However, the scenario sees Manchuria breaking away to form an independent Manchukuo under the Qing imperial court, facilitated by defected Manchu and Han units of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). Nationalist China is later reborn as the independent Cantonian Republic in the south, following a legislative decree that removes Chiang Kai-Shek from power and initiates democratic elections. Meanwhile, Imperial Japan establishes protectorates over both Manchukuo and the restored Ming dynasty to safeguard against Soviet and American hostilities, eventually transforming the Cantonian Republic into a tributary state modeled after the Tungning Kingdom. This manipulation also leads to the incorporation of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty back into the Japanese Imperial Family, given its mixed heritage linking back to the Minamoto dynasty. This intricate geopolitical reconfiguration prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War, allowing the Beiyang Government, independent Manchuria, and the Cantonian Republic to survive well into the 21st century. The division of China into distinct nations under different spheres of influence marks a significant departure from our historical trajectory, reshaping the regional and global political landscape in profound ways."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

aqui esse desenho que eu ganhei lá na fonte nova olha aqui uma ovelha fez eu tava olhando aqui agora a ovelha que acho que é Júnior né obrigado querido Deus te abençoe eu sentei aqui tava meditando lendo a bíblia e falando senhor fala comigo me dá uma direção uma palavra para quem o senhor quer que eu fale e o senhor falou assim você vai orar por filhos e filhas que são muito fortes eu tô falando aqui eu tô arrepiado eu tô arrepiado você vai orar por filhos e filhas que são muito fortes mas da porta para dentro estão passando lutas que só eles e eu sabem o que ele está o que eles estão Pass e Deus Ele me trouxe uma palavra de um homem chamado Namã Namã era um comandante de um exército um homem de uma alta patente um homem de uma alta patente autoridade muito conhecido rico mas a Bíblia diz que Namã tinha uma lepra uma doença que naquela época era uma doença incurável não tinha cura para aquela doença então Namã quem olhava para Namã não sabia o que ele o que ele tinha porque todo Comandante naquela época usava uma armadura então quando ele saía da porta para fora você via um homem com armadura cheio de Armadura e você via uma pessoa normal mas por dentro daquela armadura havia um corpo leproso por dentro daquela armadura havia um coro leproso uma pessoa leprosa uma pessoa que uma doença Estava acabando com ele aos poucos e não tinha cura então da porta para fora ele era uma pessoa que todo mundo respeitava admirava sabe achava que estava Tudo mil maravilhas da porta para dentro ele era um leproso um enfermo que não tinha cura eu estou falando aqui com pessoas Deus falou isso ao meu coração entra nas redes sociais de alguns aqui e olha para você acha que está tudo bem e não é porque você é uma pessoa falsa pelo contrário você é uma pessoa muito forte você não se deixa abater e nem demonstrar o que você está passando e isso é muito bom é assim que tem que ser é dessa forma que tem que ser então quem vê você sorrindo quem vê você brincando não sabe o que você está passando não tem ideia que pass com você assim era na mã quem olhava para ele dizia eu quero ser ele queria ser igual a ele é um comandante é rico é conhecido mas só ele sabia o que ele estava passando tem gente que está me assistindo aqui agora está aqui comigo e algumas pessoas que irão entrar aqui em algum momento dessa queum pesso gostariam de ser você elas não sabem o que você está passando elas não sabem da força que você tem que fazer para colocar um sorriso nos seus lábios da força que você está precisando fazer para mostrar que está tudo bem quando na verdade está tudo bem mal está tudo ruim difícil mas eu quero te dar uma direção como Profeta a Bíblia diz que na casa de Namã trabalhava uma mulher que era uma mulher de Deus que tinha a rotina espiritual e ela via o sofrimento dele porque ela via quando ele tirava a armadura uma lepra comendo a carne dele então ela disse para a esposa de Namã Olha eu conheço um profeta Eu conheço um homem de Deus e se o seu esposo fosse até ele ele seria curado profeta iria orar e ele seria curado a esposa de Namã falou isso para Namã então Namã sai de um lugar de um país e vai vai para o outro onde o profeta estava e a Bíblia diz que quando Namã chega lá com seus cavalos com a sua tropa sabe ele para na frente da tenda do profeta porque antigamente não era casa era tenda por isso que o Salmo 91 diz praga nenhuma chegará a sua tenda quando ele chega na frente da tenda do profeta O Profeta mandou um recado para ele Diga para ele dá sete mergulhos no rio Jordão e ele será purificado Já ensinei várias vezes aqui sobre o número sete né é o número da perfeição é o número de Deus tudo que você faz com Deus em número de sete você será abençoado por isso que eu sempre oriento as pessoas quando Ouvir o Salmo 91 sempre ouvi sete dias consecutivos se você nunca fez isso faça vai trazer muita libertação para você então profeta disse a ele manda ele dar sete mergulhos no rio Jordão ele vai ser curado quando levaram um recado para ele ele ficou revoltado ele disse ele sabe quem sou eu eu eu pensei que ele viria até mim eu pensei que ele iria me atender Eu pensei que ele iria colocar mão na minha cabeça fazer uma oração ele não fez nada ele manda eu dar sete mergulhos nesse Rio porque no local ali o Rio Jordão a água era barrenta estava barrenta Ele olhou para aquele rio e disse esse rio essas águas as águas da minha terra são muito melhores se fosse assim eu faria isso lá eu não vou fazer isso então Alguém disse assim Senhor se o profeta pedisse para o senhor fazer algo mais difícil o senhor não faria ele só pediu pro senhor dar s mergulhos então ele parou pensou e falou ah eu vou fazer então ele tira a armadura escute isso aqui que é importante ele tira armadura para mergulhar ele teve que tirar armadura então ele vai tirando tirando tirando tirando tirando e ali não é mais o comandante ali é na mã um homem frágil que estava com problema muito sério e ele começa a dar os mergulhos e a Bíblia diz que no séo mergulho a pele dele estava igual pele de criança purificada e sabe o que Espírito Santo falou a meação mã podia cur uma oração profeta estendendo a mão e fazendo uma oração não precisa na verade Deus poderia curá sem precisar ele dar aques sete mergulhos Mas sabe por Deus deu aquela direção ao profeta para que Namã tirasse a armadura e diante de Deus ele se mostrasse como ele era Olha o que eu vou te dizer nesse momento você pode se mostrar forte para qualquer pessoa e deve nem todo mundo pode saber a sua fraqueza nem todo mundo pode saber dos seus momentos difíceis porque não não vai te ajudar mas Deus Deus você pode tirar armadura para Deus você pode você tem que tirar sua armadura O que é que o Espírito Santo está me tocando para te falar nessa noite existem momentos eu tô todo arrepiado aqui eu estou sentindo a presença de Deus você que é homem você que é mulher você que não importa você que é é jovem é idoso não importa existe você que é uma pessoa que se mostra forte você que é uma pessoa que é durona Sabe aquela pessoa que se mostra forte mas tá passando problema exe tem momentos que você tem que tirar sua armadura para Deus como é que faz isso meu Bispo você fala com Deus e diz assim eu estou fraco senhor estou tão fraco você está desarmando você está tirando armadura e você está mostrando a Deus a sua fragilidade a Deus você pode mostrar a sua fragilidade senhor estou tão fraco Senhor eu não consigo nem falar o que tá se passando no meu coração senhor tô pensando em desistir senhor estou pensando em em abandonar tudo largar tudo jogar tudo para cima senhor Tô sentindo uma fraqueza senhor estou tão triste então você está tirando a sua armadura diante de Deus é assim que o milagre acontece é assim que Deus te renova é assim que Deus te coloca de pé para qualquer pessoa você pode mostrar sabe a sua armadura que você está bem que você mas para Deus Existem momentos na vida do ser humano que ele tem que tirar armadura ele tem que se lançar os pés do Senhor abraçar os pés do Senhor e dizer eu estou muito fraco eu estou muito fraca eu estou muito ansiosa eu estou sentindo uma tristeza pai uma amargura uma angústia pai eu tô sentindo uma tristeza tão grande no meu coração Olha quando você fizer isso aquela água era barr mas lavou na mão quando você tira a sua armadura diante de Deus o Espírito Santo Te lava o Espírito Santo Te lava tira tudo de ruim é assim que você é curado é liberto liberta é assim que Deus te abençoa então nessa noite eu quero te direcionar tire armadura diante de Deus sabe depois dessa oração

Mangoes can be eaten fresh, used in cooking, or processed into products like juices, smoothies, and desserts."},{"instruction":"provide graph of quadratic equation","output":"I can't directly generate or display graphs, but I can guide you on how to visualize or create a graph of a quadratic equation yourself. A quadratic equation is typically of the form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), where (a), (b), and (c) are constants. The graph of such an equation is a parabola. If you would like to graph a specific quadratic equation, say (y = x^2 - 4x + 3), you would follow these steps, ideally using graphing software or a graphing calculator: 1. **Identify the coefficients:** Here, (a = 1), (b = -4), and (c = 3). 2. **Determine the vertex:** The vertex of a parabola given in this form can be found using the formula (x = -frac{b}{2a}) for the x-coordinate, and solving for (y) using that value of (x). For our example, the vertex is at (x = 2), putting that back into the equation gives us (y = 2^2 - 4*2 + 3 = -1), thus the vertex is at (2, -1). 3. **Identify the axis of symmetry:** This is a vertical line that passes through the vertex; for our equation, it's (x = 2). 4. **Determine a few points:** Select a few values of (x) to calculate corresponding (y) values, and plot them. For instance, if (x = 0), (y = 3); if (x = 1), (y = 0); and so on. The equation is symmetric about the axis of symmetry, so you can mirror points on one side of the vertex to the other. 5. **Draw the parabola:** Connect the points with a smooth curve to form the parabola, ensuring it opens upwards (since (a = 1) is positive). The vertex is the lowest point on the graph since the parabola opens upwards. Doing this manually on graph paper involves plotting the x-y coordinates based on your calculated points, or you can use various online graphing tools and calculators, where you simply input the quadratic equation, and it generates the graph for you. Popular tools include Desmos, GeoGebra, and even the graphing function in a Google search. Remember, the key characteristics of a quadratic equation's graph are its vertex, its axis of symmetry, and whether it opens upwards or downwards (which is determined by the sign of (a))."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Elle pourrait être en train de construire son réseau pour diverses raisons sociales ou professionnelles futures. 6. **Erreur / Accident :** Bien que moins probable, il est aussi possible qu'elle t'ait envoyé des snaps par erreur, surtout s'ils semblaient ne pas être destinés spécifiquement à toi. Si tu te sens à l'aise, le meilleur moyen de comprendre son intention est simplement de lui demander. Un message simple et amical pourrait faire l'affaire, quelque chose comme : \\"Salut, j'ai bien reçu tes snaps !

Father and sons might have regularly buckled on their swords, and mothers and daughters rightfully expected the respectful greeting of Sunday churchgoers, but it did not remain unnoticed that the number of their servants was reduced, that they no longer sent out widespread invitations, and that their daughters had to accept being married without a dowry. By the end of the ancien régime, some 11,000 noble families are supposed to have lived in material conditions that did not allow for any kind of luxury, scarcely any servants, no dinner parties and only rarely even new frocks for the ladies. A further 5,000 families were actually impoverished, and some nobles had even sunk into destitution.2 Leaving aside this category, almost all noble families disposed of seigneurial rights that could be used for appropriation, i.e. they were still in a dominant class position over many peasant families, labourers and even townsmen. This did not necessarily make them part of the materially dominant strata. For, in the course of the ancien régime, the unity of estate membership and economic dominance had increasingly dissolved. The richest in the land continued to be noble, and the poorest in the land were noble only in exceptional cases. But, in the middle strata of wealth and access to class-type power of appropriation, social rank did not necessarily correspond to material position. Right to the end of the ancien régime, wealth in France brought access to nobility by pur-chase of an office or letters patent (no one was ennobled who did not possess the means to live a noble life; even those ennoblements that rewarded services cost 6,000 livres for the registration of letters patent, not to mention the costs required to bring a person's services to the king's attention), but - apart from the purchase of the office of a royal secretary - ennoblement only granted ‘nobility in waiting'. Whilst service was increasingly respected in the second half of the eighteenth century, this did not go so far as to displace the criteria of length of nobility in determining social rank. It was indeed the case, in France, that the crown's control of defining the social hierarchy was more extensive than in England, yet its reach was not so great that it could distribute social ranks according to political power within the ruling estate. To this extent, the hierarchy of social ranks within the nobility remained contested, despite all the connections between families of the ‘sword' and the 'robe'. Still more relevant is the fact that the guarantee (in effect almost unconditional) of permanence of nobility once acquired caused the estate hierarchy sanctioned by the ruling power to depart in certain areas from the hierarchy of material position. This, together with the fact that the noble hierarchy was represented in court ceremonial in a manner that scorned the emerging ideal of virtue, led to a situation in which noble ranks lost their unambiguous anchorage in socially prevailing values - though they certainly remained attractive. There was no comparable development in England, since rise into the nobil-ity was first of all socially sanctioned. Similarly to the French case, possession of certain office competences seen as ennobling was decisive. The decisive hurdle to be overcome on the ascendant path, the qualification for Justice of the Peace, while it presupposed a fairly large landholding - at least if it was to provide proof of nobility - also presupposed recognition of membership by the local nobility. This could sometimes be achieved within a single generation, but often it was a gradual process, taking two or three generations, to achieve social integration into the upper strata of ‘landed society'. Wealth made possible investment in land, and was also the prerequisite to finance an appropriate lifestyle. But only if a family was socially accepted did it come to form part of the gentry, let alone of the ‘county' (i.e. a gentry family with influence at the county level). The outward feature of such membership, a family coat of arms, could indeed be bought. But, if this was done too soon, it demonstrated only the intent to seek a future rise into the noble estate. This intent had to be realised by participation in estate ruling practice. Because the estate was self-recruiting in this way, and only needed confirmation from the crown, the reproduction of estate rule in the course of time came increasingly to be realised in cultural hegemony: the ideal of a noble life. In their efforts to acquire a landed property, or simply build a villa in the country, even those town-dwellers who consciously renounced the attempt to integrate into ‘landed society' paid obeisance to the dominant cultural pattern. So long as rich landowners in the provinces could decide on membership of the nobility, the privileged income sources of landed property and office power and the demand of a certain style of behaviour remained the most important selection criteria. This excluded very many of the well-to-do in practice, without any formal barrier being imposed. What is decisive however for the political importance of estate boundaries is not a statistical comparison of successful and unsuccessful attempts at social advance, or even those merely undertaken, but rather the degree to which the prevailing criteria of selection were accepted by those who hoped to rise into the gentry. In England, moreover, there certainly was a de facto restriction on access to high office, even if this was not formalised, and so there was a regular process of ‘sideways' movement into the nobility, i.e. social advance that within a single generation led from plain gentleman to peer. This enabled the service nobility that from the Middle Ages was a characteristic element of the English nobility, based on a granting of titles to individuals that was broadly accepted, to be reconciled with those ideals of achievement that raised the hopes of many aspirants to advance. No matter how violent political criticism of the peers or even the entire system of estate privileges sometimes grew, after the brief interlude of the republic in the mid-seventeenth century there never again developed in England an influential social basis for the demand to abolish the nobility. The lowest strata of the gentry, however, did in practice lose their noble status in the course of the eighteenth century. As increasing numbers of urban bourgeois became rich and respected enough to style themselves Gentleman or Esquire and expect their wives and daughters to be addressed as Lady, an entire social stratum pressed forward in a certain sense into the social status of ‘plain gentleman' without the selection and cooptation procedures of formerly established nobles being applied. The effect of this advance was a general social devaluation of the position of ‘plain gentlemen'. Because of this, the fact that there were ever more urban bourgeois who were both richer and more educated than many of the simple landed nobility could no longer lead to social conflict. The offspring of the former ‘parish gentry' still had de facto advantages - for example, if their sons wanted to become army officers - but, taken as a whole, a coincidence between estate hierarchy and wealth hierarchy was once again established. Nobility now began only at the level of the ‘county gentry', a social group that had no problem in competing in material terms with the urban ‘gentlemen'. Nobility in England was the preserve of those who managed to maintain themselves even in conditions of changed practices of appropriation and new ideas of value. 4. From ancien régime to bourgeois state power: reasons for the ‘special roads’ In societies of the ancien-régime structural type, the dominant forms of rule were personal. Ruling competences were the possession of individuals - through inheritance, purchase or transmission. The constitution of bourgeois state power presupposed the expropriation of these individuals - and, moreover, without compensation! Such a process of expropriation did indeed take place over the duration of the ancien régime: by the limitation or abolition of seigneurial competences, for example, or the regulated connection of royal ruling practice to specific forms of participation. Yet the implementation of bourgeois forms of political organisation required not just attacks on venerable traditions and privileges, but also on property in the full sense of the term, and the interpretation of ‘established interests' as property. Since it is notoriously far from easy for proprietors to recognise the justification of demands that aim at their expropriation, the ‘French road' of structural revolution is, in a certain sense, the most obvious. For this reason, we shall focus here on the question of the structural preconditions for the ‘English road'. It is only to a limited extent that the specific course of the bourgeois revolu-tion can be explained in terms of structural preconditions. Charles I did not have to oppose demands for constitutionalisation, and the financial crisis of the French monarchy could have been overcome yet again by the reform pro-posals that Loménie de Brienne proposed to the assembly of notables in 1787 - hard as it is to imagine their being accepted. Numerous examples can be given for the successful effects of decisions by individuals or small groups. The way in which such decisions come to be made can generally be understood if the socialisation conditions of the individuals in question are investigated, the specific forms and material preconditions of their individual practice of life, along with the actual decision situations. At the level of the structural analysis undertaken in this work, however, decisions of this kind have to be seen as historical accidents. This line of argument can be illustrated by a particularly striking example: the stabilisation of estate rule that was achieved in England in the latter part of the seventeenth century, and above all the first half of the eighteenth, was a structural precondition for the depersonalisation of royal ruling practice, for its far-reaching integration into generalised and dominant estate interests. But the fact that this process took place without any hint of revolution - even though it was much more extensive than the limitations on his power that Charles I had found unacceptable - rested on the readiness of William III to concede to Parliament large parts of the rule conveyed to him in 1689, in return for the financing of ‘his' war on the Continent. This readiness can be perfectly well explained in terms of the rank order of interests of the new king, but in relation to the structural preconditions of the development of ruling power it is just as contingent as the political crisis that provoked a change of dynasty. Taking into account considerations of this kind, and the exaggerations that are unavoidable in such comparisons, it is possible to establish different structural preconditions in France and England for the forms of practical criti-cism of the ancien régime, which I shall now go on to explain. ”翻译为中文","output":"在法国，可能会发生这样的情况：一个非常古老且因此非常显赫的贵族剑士家族，即使在财富方面无法与某些农民家庭竞争，仍继续享有领主司法权限，甚至可能将领主权利出租给他们。父亲和儿子们可能会定期佩戴剑，而母亲和女儿们则有权期待周日做礼拜的人们的尊敬问候，但人们注意到他们的仆人数量减少了，他们不再发出广泛的邀请，他们的女儿不得不接受无嫁妆的婚姻。到旧制度结束时，大约有11,000个贵族家庭的物质条件不允许任何奢侈，几乎没有仆人，没有宴会，女士们甚至很少有新裙子。另外5,000个家庭实际上贫困，一些贵族甚至陷入了赤贫。撇开这一类别不谈，几乎所有的贵族家庭都拥有可以用于占有的领主权利，即他们仍然在许多农民家庭、劳工甚至市民之上占据着主导阶级地位。这并不一定使他们成为物质主导阶层的一部分。因为，在旧制度的过程中，财富与经济主导地位的统一逐渐解体。国内最富有的人继续是贵族，而国内最贫穷的人仅在特殊情况下是贵族。但在财富和获取阶级型掠夺权力的途径的中间阶层中，社会地位并不一定对应于物质地位。直到旧制度结束时，在法国，财富通过购买官职或颁发专利信函获得贵族身份（没有人会被封为贵族，如果他没有过上贵族生活的手段；即使那些奖励服务的封爵也需要为专利信函的注册支付6,000里弗，更不用说吸引国王注意所需的费用了），但是除了购买皇家秘书职位外，封爵只授予“待命的贵族”。尽管在十八世纪下半叶，服务越来越受到尊重，但这并没有走得太远，以至于取代贵族资历长短在决定社会地位方面的标准。 的确，在法国，国王对定义社会等级的控制比在英国更加广泛，但其影响力并不足以根据统治阶级内的政治权力分配社会等级。在这方面，尽管“剑士”家族和“法衣”家族之间存在着所有联系，贵族内部的社会等级仍然存在争议。更为相关的是，一旦获得的贵族身份几乎无条件地得到保证，这导致由统治权力认可的贵族等级体系在某些领域偏离了物质地位的等级体系。这一点，加上贵族等级在法庭礼仪中的体现方式轻视了新兴的美德理想，导致了贵族等级失去了在社会普遍价值观中的明确锚定——尽管它们当然仍然具有吸引力。 在英国没有发生类似的发展，因为晋升为贵族首先是社会认可的。类似于法国的情况，拥有某些被视为封爵的官职能力是决定性的。决定性的障碍是和平法官的资格，虽然它假设拥有相当大的土地所有权——至少如果它是要证明贵族身份的话——也假设要被当地贵族认可。这有时可以在一代人内实现，但通常是一个渐进过程，需要两到三代人的时间来实现社会融入上层的“土地社会”。财富使投资于土地成为可能，并且也是资助相应生活方式的先决条件。但只有当一个家庭被社会接受，它才会成为绅士阶层的一部分，更不用说成为“郡”的一部分了（即在郡一级具有影响力的绅士家庭）。这种成员资格的外在特征，一个家族徽章，的确可以购买。但如果这样做太早，它只表明试图寻求未来晋升为贵族阶层的意图。这种意图必须通过参与地产统治实践来实现。因为贵族阶层这样自我招募，并且只需要来自王室的确认，贵族统治的再生产随着时间的推移越来越多地在文化霸权中实现：贵族生活的理想。即使是那些有意识地放弃尝试融入“土地社会”的城市居民，在购买土地产业或仅仅是在乡村建造别墅时，也对主导文化模式表示敬意。只要富裕的地主能够决定谁是贵族，土地财产和官职权力的特权收入来源以及某种行为风格的要求仍然是最重要的选拔标准。这在实践中排除了许多富裕人士，而无需设立任何形式的障碍。然而，对于贵族界限的政治重要性而言，决定性的不是成功和未能成功的社会进步尝试的统计比较，甚至是仅仅尝试的，而是希望晋升为绅士的人是否接受了选拔标准。此外，在英国，对高级职位的准入确实存在事实上的限制，即使这没有被正式化，因此存在一种“横向”晋升为贵族的规律过程，即在一代人内从普通绅士晋升为贵族。这使得基于对个人授予头衔的广泛接受的中世纪英国特有的服务贵族，与那些提高了许多有抱负者希望晋升的成就理想相协调。无论对贵族或甚至整个贵族特权体系的政治批评有多激烈，十七世纪中叶共和国短暂插曲之后，英国再也没有出现过要求废除贵族制度的有影响力的社会基础。 然而，到了十八世纪，地位最低的绅士实际上在实践中失去了他们的贵族地位。随着越来越多的城市资产阶级变得足够富有和受人尊敬，以至于他们自称为绅士或乡绅，并期望他们的妻子和女儿被称为女士，一个完整的社会阶层在某种意义上挤入了“普通绅士”的社会地位，而没有应用之前建立的贵族的选拔和吸纳程序。这种进步的效果是“普通绅士”地位的普遍社会贬值。因此，越来越多的城市资产阶级比许多简单的土地贵族更富有且受过更好教育，这一事实不再导致社会冲突。前“教区绅士”的后代仍然具有事实上的优势——例如，如果他们的儿子想成为军官——但总的来说，贵族等级体系和财富等级体系再次建立了一致。现在，贵族身份仅限于那些即使在占有实践和价值观念发生改变的条件下仍能维持自己地位的人。 4. 从旧制度到资产阶级国家权力：‘特殊道路’的原因 在旧制度结构类型的社会中，统治形式是个人的。统治能力是个体的财产——通过继承、购买或传递拥有。资产阶级国家权力的构成前提假设了这些个体的剥夺——而且，而且是无偿的！这种剥夺的过程确实在旧制度的持续期间发生了：例如通过限制或废除领主权限，或将王室统治实践与特定形式的参与连接起来进行规范化。然而，实现资产阶级政治组织形式不仅需要对古老的传统和特权进行攻击，还需要对财产的完整意义以及将“既定利益”解释为财产进行攻击。由于所有者很难认可旨在剥夺他们的要求的正当性，因此在某种意义上，“法国道路”的结构革命是最显而易见的。因此，我们将在这里关注“英国道路”的结构前提条件问题。 资产阶级革命的具体过程只能在有限的范围内用结构前提条件来解释。查理一世不必反对要求宪政化的要求，法国君主制的财政危机本可以再次通过洛梅尼·德·布里恩在1787年向贵族会议提出的改革建议来克服——尽管很难想象它们被接受。可以举出许多个人或小团体的决策成功影响的例子。如果调查这些个人的社会化条件、他们个人生活实践的具体形式和物质前提条件，以及实际的决策情境，通常可以理解这样的决策是如何做出的。然而，在本工作进行的结构分析层面上，这类决策必须被视为历史意外。这种论证可以通过一个特别引人注目的例子来说明：十七世纪后期和十八世纪上半叶在英国实现的贵族统治的稳定，是王室统治实践去人格化的结构前提条件，这种去人格化在很大程度上融入了普遍和主导的贵族利益。但是这个过程发生时没有任何革命迹象——尽管它比查理一世发现不可接受的对他权力的限制要广泛得多——这取决于威廉三世准备在1689年向议会让渡他的大部分统治权，以换取对“他的”大陆战争的资助。这种准备可以完全根据新国王的利益排序来解释，但就统治权力发展的结构前提条件而言，它与引发王朝更迭的政治危机一样是偶然的。 考虑到这类考虑因素，以及在这种比较中不可避免的夸张，可以确定法国和英国对旧制度实践批判形式的不同结构前提条件，我将在下文中解释。"},{"instruction":"请将“Emancipation of a political public from the structures of personal rule The practice of personal rule was the form of motion of the societies of the ancien régime. In the process of the abolition of personal rule, the public devel-oped into the subject of political opinion, and public opinion became the form of motion of society. But there were already political publics under the ancien régime. There was an audience to whom rule was presented, proclaimed, and sometimes even explained. There was even already a reasoning public. If Jürgen Habermas dates the formation of new structures of the public sphere in England to the late eighteenth century, and ascribes these to differences between the ‘restrictive interests of commercial and finance capital on the one side, and the expansive interests of manufacturing and industrial capital on the other',3 this causal analysis of the constitution of the structural type of ‘early bourgeois public' needs to be questioned not just in respect to its char-acterisation of the economic interests of the late eighteenth century. Reasoning over different interests in England had already for a long time formed a regular aspect of the practice of personal rule. This ‘showed the king his right' - in Reinhart Koselleck's expression.4 It did not necessarily follow from the chang-ing material conditions for the constitution of interests that the king would be placed in a false position, and the legitimisation of his - still existing - rule contested. The emancipation of the public from the context of personal rule does not stand in any causal connection with the implementing of capitalist forms of production and circulation. The actual generalisation of royal rule, and the obligation arising from it for the nobility to participate in the royal exercise of rule, led in England to forms and practices of a public sphere arising that could make the structural change in public opinion appear as the expansion of something already existing; these institutional changes were marked by freedom of the press, reform of suffrage, and change in the party structures. This aspect, which in a certain sense belongs to institutional history, has persistently been politically functionalised in English historiography. Comparison makes it clear that this is not entirely without justification. For, in France, criticism of rule did indicate its structural crisis. Applied to France, Reinhart Koselleck's conclusion that criticism meant the beginning of the end of established rule is indeed pertinent. But it is not so for England. The fact that the English ancien régime displayed a regular practice of negotiation with the criticism of rule is seen by Koselleck only as expressing a ‘close liaison' between Freemasonry and Georgian politics.5 There are two respects in which the perspective of institutional history - as expressed in the work of Kurt Kluxen6 - is unreliably restricted. On the one hand, by being generally limited to the ‘national level' and leaving out of consideration the public of local rule that is at least equally important. (This practice is also followed by Habermas in his depiction of the ‘model case of English development'.) On the other hand, by neglecting the emancipation of the public from the context of personal rule that was achieved in the public for religious discourse. The thesis I will propose here, that the public as bearer of ‘public opinion' in England made up a regular component of the practice of rule under the developed ancien régime, includes both these aspects. The Reformation has key significance in this context, as by this process the crown - in collaboration with Parliament - appropriated religious power along with the goods of the church. It prescribed a new practice of belief, and sanctioned moral norms. The realisation of royal church rule, however, called into being a public for questions of belief, and hence a debate not just about God but also about the world, which transcended the framework of existing rule. The generalisation of this discourse was facilitated by the new media of communication, and promoted by the search for kindred spirits. Even if this took different forms in the course of time, and limits on regional diffusion can easily be shown, the fact remains that in England from the sixteenth century there was a public for matters of religious belief in which not only the propertied classes took part. This was, indeed, regulated by ruling power. But regulation of this kind required for its part that the regulating instance was integrated into the struc-tures of the religious public. It was within this public that the dynamic of revolutionary debate developed in the mid-seventeenth century. After 1660, religion remained the dominant content of generalised public debates, though now with an altered significance. During the entire remaining duration of the ancien régime in England, political goals were predominantly formulated in connection with religious discourse. This was not a mere matter of form: the religious and moral char-acteristic of public discourse served as a basis for demands on the self-concep-tion of the ruling estates. If moral campaigns could achieve success in English politics, though this also has material causes, the structural importance of a public marked by Protestantism cannot be overestimated. In France, conflicts of religious belief were very rapidly colonised in the sixteenth century by noble clientelism. Though the Jansenist dispute within the Catholic church did subsequently produce a broader religious public, if still limited in comparison with the English case, the crown used papal con-demnations of heresy to exclude discussion of reform from the public permit-ted by the ruling power. It was not completely successful in this, but both the theological content of Jansenism and its principal social basis in the educated estate limited its importance for the practice of local rule. In France, convinced Christians were constrained far more than in England to live out their piety in private. Otherwise than in England, however, religious discourse did not effect any structural change in the legitimisation of rule. When eventually, in the eighteenth century, a moral critique of established rule developed also in France, though this had an anticlerical tendency, its mode of argument was philosophical rather than religious. In the context of a ruling practice that sought to enforce ‘good order' by the unity of religious practice, this critique - unlike the religiously based moral criticism in England - was not negotiable. The second decisive precondition for the specific political forms in which the emancipation of the public sphere from the context of personal rule took place in England was the local generalisation of estate ruling practice. Already under the ancien régime, an estate public developed in the provinces into the de facto subject of public opinion. Though the Justices of the Peace acted formally as agents of the crown, they did so in actual fact in association with the local nobility. Their selection, and their conduct in office, was conditional on their views coinciding on relevant matters with those of the local political public. This was bourgeoisified by the social expansion of the public along with the redefinition of the forms of social exclusion. At the same time, political debates were, in a certain sense, nationalised and the results of these debates regula-rised. Since the decision competences of Justices of the Peace were curtailed and supplanted in this way, the structural importance of the continuing estate practices of exclusion from the local political public was reduced. This cen-tralisation of rule, however, also abolished the opportunities for the common people to indicate in terms of reason the limits to local rule. While the noble opposition had earlier on repeatedly demanded, against the expansion of the state's instruments of repression, that the public allowed to criticise specific practices of rule should be broadened, this mode of behaviour was curtailed with the embourgeoisement of the organisation of political power, if not abol-ished altogether. Police, the poor law, and public-order legislation were used to deny the reasoning of the common people, not only with new ‘arguments' but also with new means. Appeal to ‘traditional rights' was obsolete vis-à-vis the impersonal power of the bourgeois state. Whilst, under the ancien régime, it was possible to indicate to the possessors of personal rule the limits of their rule - even if at risk to life and limb -, the representation of political interests resulting from the centralisation of power practice demanded the support of ‘public opinion'. This, however, presupposed financial and organisational resources that had long been unavailable to the common people. In this way, while the structural compulsion to rebellious expression was certainly altered with the emancipation of the public, it was by no means abolished. In the circumstances of the war against the enemies of the Revolution, France temporarily achieved at the end of the eighteenth century a far-reaching though by no means complete abolition of the material and institutional barriers on the political public. But public-order strategies were very rapidly and successfully developed, supported by the ‘order-loving', i.e. better-off, strata. The exclusion of the common people from public expression, both de facto and de jure, showed the common concern of these strata in both France and England to monopolise for themselves the emancipation of the public from the context of personal rule.”翻译为中文","output":"政治公众从个人统治结构中的解放 个人统治的实践是旧制度社会的运动形式。在废除个人统治的过程中，公众发展成为政治观点的主体，公共舆论成为社会的运动形式。但在旧制度下已经存在了政治公众。有一个观众群体，向他们展示、宣布，有时甚至解释统治。甚至已经存在了一个有理性的公众。如果尤尔根·哈贝马斯将英国公共领域新结构的形成定位在十八世纪晚期，并将这归因于“一方面是商业和金融资本的限制性利益，另一方面是制造和工业资本的扩张性利益”之间的差异，那么这种对‘早期资产阶级公众’结构类型构成的因果分析就需要质疑，不仅仅是关于十八世纪晚期经济利益的特征。在英格兰，对不同利益的推理已经长期形成了个人统治实践的常规方面。这“向国王展示了他的权利”——用莱因哈特·科塞莱克的表达。这并不一定意味着，随着构成利益的物质条件的变化，国王会被置于错误的位置，他的（仍然存在的）统治的合法性受到质疑。公众从个人统治背景中的解放与实施资本主义生产和流通形式之间没有任何因果关系。 英格兰的皇家统治的实际普及，以及由此产生的贵族参与王权行使的义务，导致了公共领域的形式和实践的出现，这些形式和实践使公共舆论的结构变化看起来像是已有事物的扩展；这些制度变革的特点是新闻自由、选举权改革和党派结构的变化。这一方面，在某种意义上属于制度史，一直在英国史学中被政治功能化。对比使人清楚，这并非完全没有道理。因为，在法国，对统治的批评确实表明了其结构危机。将科塞莱克的结论应用于法国，即批评意味着既定统治结束的开始，确实是相关的。但对于英格兰来说则不然。科塞莱克只将英格兰旧制度表现出的与统治批评谈判的常规实践视为表达了共济会与乔治时代政治之间的“密切联系”。 在两个方面，从制度史的视角（如库尔特·克鲁森的作品中所表达）来看，是不可靠地受限的。一方面，它通常仅限于“国家层面”，忽略了至少同样重要的地方统治公众。（哈贝马斯在描绘“英国发展的典范情况”时也遵循了这种做法。）另一方面，忽视了在宗教话语公众中实现的公众从个人统治背景中解放的成就。 我在这里提出的论点是，作为“公共舆论”载体的公众在发展完善的旧制度下的统治实践中构成了英格兰的一个常规组成部分，包括这两个方面。在此背景下，宗教改革具有关键意义，因为通过这一过程，皇室与议会合作占有了教会的宗教权力及其财产。它规定了一种新的信仰实践，并制定了道德规范。然而，王室教会统治的实现，呼唤了一个信仰问题的公众，因此引发了不仅关于上帝而且还关于世界的辩论，这超越了现有统治的框架。新的传播媒介促进了这种话语的普及，并由寻找志同道合的人推动。即使这在随后的时间里采取了不同的形式，并且区域扩散的限制很容易显示出来，但事实仍然是，从十六世纪起，英格兰就存在着一个涉及宗教信仰问题的公众，不仅有产者阶级参与其中。的确，这是由统治权力调控的。但这种调控也需要调控实体自身融入到宗教公众的结构中。正是在这个公众中，十七世纪中叶革命性辩论的动力得以发展。1660年后，宗教仍然是普遍公共辩论的主要内容，尽管现在其重要性已经改变。 在英格兰旧制度剩余时期，政治目标主要是与宗教话语相联系来制定的。这不仅仅是形式上的事情：公共话语的宗教和道德特性为对统治阶层自我认识的要求提供了基础。如果道德运动能在英国政治中取得成功，尽管这也有物质原因，但不能低估一个以新教主义为标志的公众的结构重要性。 在法国，宗教信仰的冲突在十六世纪非常迅速地被贵族客户主义所殖民。尽管天主教内部的耶ansen派争议随后产生了更广泛的宗教公众，尽管与英国情形相比仍有限，但皇室利用教皇对异端的谴责排除了对统治权力允许的公众进行改革讨论。这并非完全成功，但耶ansen主义的神学内容及其在受过教育的阶层中的主要社会基础限制了其对地方统治实践的重要性。在法国，虔诚的基督徒比在英国更受限于在私人生活中体现其虔诚。然而，与英国不同的是，宗教话语并未引起统治合法性的结构性变化。当最终在十八世纪法国也发展出了对既定统治的道德批判时，尽管这具有反教权倾向，但其论证方式是哲学的而非宗教的。在一个寻求通过宗教实践统一“良好秩序”的统治实践背景中，这种批判与英国基于宗教的道德批评不同，是不可协商的。 在英格兰，公共领域从个人统治背景中解放的具体政治形式中，地方贵族统治实践的普及是第二个决定性的前提条件。早在旧制度下，地方的贵族公众就已经发展成为了公共舆论的事实主体。尽管治安法官名义上作为王室的代理人行事，但他们实际上是与地方贵族协同工作。他们的选择和任职行为取决于他们在相关事务上的观点与地方政治公众的观点一致。这一点通过公众的社会扩展以及对社会排斥形式的重新定义而得到资产阶级化。与此同时，政治辩论在某种意义上被国家化，这些辩论的结果被规范化。由于这样，治安法官的决策权被削弱和取代，从而减少了地方政治公众继续排斥的贵族实践的结构重要性。然而，这种统治的中央集权化也取消了普通民众用理由指出地方统治限制的机会。虽然贵族反对派此前一再要求，针对国家的镇压工具的扩张，应扩大被允许批评特定统治实践的公众，但随着政治权力组织的资产阶级化，这种行为模式被削减，如果不是完全废除的话。警察、贫困法和公共秩序立法被用来否认普通民众的推理，不仅用新的“论点”而且还用新的手段。向资产阶级国家的非人格化权力提出“传统权利”的上诉已经过时。在旧制度下，可以向个人统治的拥有者指出其统治的限制——即使这冒着生命和四肢的风险——而由于权力实践的中央集权化产生的政治利益表达，需要“公共舆论”的支持。然而，这需要财政和组织资源，这些资源普通民众长期以来都无法获得。这样，虽然公众的解放改变了反叛表达的结构性压力，但绝不意味着它被废除了。在对抗革命的敌人的战争情况下，法国在十八世纪末暂时实现了政治公众物质和制度障碍的广泛而非完全的废除。但很快就成功地发展了维护公共秩序的策略，得到了“爱好秩序”即较为富裕阶层的支持。普通民众在事实上和法律上都被排除在公共表达之外，显示了法国和英国这些阶层在将公众从个人统治背景中解放出来为自己所垄断方面的共同关切。"},{"instruction":"请将“De facto power competences and forms of generalised personal rule In France, too, the competition between noble rule and royal power under the ancien régime was much less than is generally assumed. Yet, not only did the personal character of monarchical rule in France persist until the end of the ancien régime, the competences of the crown were actually extended in the course of the seventeenth century. In England, on the other hand, royal power competences were curtailed by the revolutions of the seventeenth century, and, in the decades following the so-called ‘Glorious Revolution', they were largely reduced to the representation of estate interests. From this time on, state policy was first and foremost the result of conflicts within the estates. These could also turn on the degree to which the interests of groups of the population who did not belong to the privileged estates should be taken into consideration, and the forms in which this should be done. Though estate rule in England was institutionalised, it was comparatively only little formalised, and moreover only with respect to membership of the Upper House being attributed to particular individuals. To this extent, the expanded participation of new social forces in the practice of rule could in part take the place of a simple exchange of personnel - even if this was not achievable without resistance. A major part of the ‘bourgeois revolution' was achieved in England by the changing social composition of the Commissions of the Peace. In order to assess this process correctly, it is useful to examine it more closely. For, just as in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the ‘quarter sessions' had both constituted and displayed the local context of estate ruling practice, across all existing differences, so the assemblies of magistrates in the nineteenth century expressed a public depiction of the development of class-type ruling interests that transcended estate boundaries - however conflictual the process by which this arose. In England, too, ruling competences were expropriated in the course of the bourgeois revolution. The estate dominance of Parliament, though not abolished by the electoral reforms of 1832 and 1867, was reduced from a guaranteed estate possession of rule to a structural favouring of particular social groups in the electoral procedure. It was within these institutionalised forms in the last third of the nineteenth century, when the economic and social position of landowners had greatly deteriorated, that a far-reaching exchange of personnel could be achieved without major institutional changes. The final abolition of the ancien régime in Parliament was first and foremost achieved in the form of social struggles, and less as an attack on remaining institutions of estate rule. A similar process took place in many towns. There, too, it was not the legal changes of 1834 that abolished the dominance of the nobility and the forms of their rule, but only long political struggles in the context of altered economic preconditions. The process of exchange of personnel in the context of continuing estate dominance even under reformed conditions was supplemented by a process of centralisation. The old forms of local rule were not abolished. But ever more new authorities were created - with their incumbents recruited from different social provenance - and the local administration controlled more strongly by instances of the central government, and this restricted the decision com-petences of Justices of the Peace. The practice of the latter was increasingly confined to class-based general public-order purposes. In comparison to the English case, the preconditions for the participation of rising social forces in generalised ruling practice were far less favourable in France. Though offices in administration and justice could be acquired with money and good connections, this did not mean that those members of the Third Estate who did not strive for office had improved prospects for advancing their interests. In France, the embourgeoisement of ruling power could not be advanced by an exchange of personnel. There was eventually as it happened a notable continuity. But the office-holders had to be expropriated before office power could be made an instrument of definite interests - whether estate or class ones. Before 1789, this happened only in a very limited sphere of the financial administration. Even the demand for a far-reaching participation of the Third Estate in the planned estate assembly - quite comparable with the demand for electoral reform in favour of the well-to-do commoners in England - necessarily had a different political significance in France. Since there was no practice of regular representation of generalised estate interests, the demand of 1788 that the quotas for the estates in the proclaimed assembly should be altered was neces-sarily addressed directly to the crown. The campaign for 'doubling' thus criti-cised the established structure of monarchical ruling practice. In the English case, on the other hand, the campaign for electoral reform was addressed to Parliament, and its content was that the chances of electoral success should be improved for political groups that represented previously disadvantaged interests. Injurious consequences from electoral reform were neither hoped for nor feared. That the question was one of prognoses, of which some moreover were erroneous, indicates that in England it is the electoral public to whom the concrete results of institutional reforms should ultimately be attributed. The 'new men' had to struggle not only against outdated legislation, but equally against the electorate's willingness to be won over by traditional forms of power - beer and ham, promises of patronage and even outright bribes. In England, the question was the assertion of new interests, in France, the demand for institutions that would make political struggles over interests possible in the first place. Participation of the ruling estates in new forms of appropriation One of the most important preconditions for the historical possibility of reforming the ancien régime into bourgeois society resulted in England from the fact that the politically leading strata of the nobility were able to maintain an economically leading position even after giving up participation in centralised appropriation. Whilst the gentry had already been substantially affected by the relative decline in agricultural incomes, families of the high nobility were often able to compensate for the effects of the agricultural change by profiting from their ownership of the urban land needed for industrialisation. To a certain extent, they also participated in new trading companies and productive enterprises. On this basis, public campaigns could win support from at least a significant number of politically active aristocrats, though certainly not all of them. By deciding to abandon privileges, they managed to maintain their political dominance for a further half century - at least as long as the political importance of great individual wealth and the hegemony of estate culture remained unbroken. The gentry, on the other hand, largely lost their status by the economic rise of new circles and the professionalisation of state administration, eventually affecting even the army. Their selfconsciousness was however able to survive in the persistence of cultural ideals of ‘landed life', and estate-marked behavioural norms of 'ladies' and 'gentlemen'. In France, the structural preconditions for the possibility of reform were very much less favourable. Though recent research on the French Revolution has been keen to stress the readiness of the nobility to reform, the discourse adduced in this connection has to be countered in the present context by the fact that the material existence of precisely the leading strata of the nobility was in one way or another bound up with the persistence of a considerable indebtedness of the crown. The crown's debts made possible the payment of interest, and they foiled all plans by the government to buy back office property on a large scale, so as to exert more effective control over officials. There were, indeed, those nobles, especially in the higher ranks of the noblesse d’épée, who invested in industrial and commercial undertakings, but, for most families in the upper reaches of both branches of the nobility, participation in centralised appropriation and the exploitation of seigneurial appropriation competences were key elements in their material reproduction. Among those families of the noblesse d'épée whose economic situation only made possible a less luxurious life in the country, many insisted all the more on the privileges available to them as their material situation and the prospects for their sons to achieve profitable offices declined. Otherwise than in England, however, it was precisely among the less well-off landed nobility that many demanded the abolition of noble privileges, or at least a reduction in these, as they saw them as benefiting above all the great magnates. In both kingdoms, reforms of the ‘state apparatus' demanded an attack on ‘vested interests', interests that were long established and in part legally guaranteed. But in France, the political strength of those convinced that the social position of the ruling strata could only be maintained at the price of fundamental reforms was not sufficient to prevail against their estate compeers.”翻译为中文","output":"实际权力能力和普遍化个人统治的形式 在法国，贵族统治与王权之间的竞争在旧制度下也远不如普遍认为的那样激烈。然而，不仅法国的君主制个人统治特征一直持续到旧制度结束，而且在十七世纪期间，王权的权能实际上得到了扩展。而在英格兰，因十七世纪的革命，王权能力被削弱，且在所谓的“光荣革命”之后的几十年里，这些能力大部分被削减为代表贵族利益。从这时起，国家政策首先是贵族内部冲突的结果。这些冲突还可能关系到不属于特权贵族的人群利益在多大程度上应该被考虑，以及这应该以何种形式完成。 尽管在英格兰，贵族统治是制度化的，但相对来说只有很少的正规化，而且仅与被指定给特定个人的上议院成员资格有关。在这个意义上，新的社会力量在统治实践中的扩大参与部分上可以取代简单的人员更替——即使这并非不经抵抗就能实现。英格兰的“资产阶级革命”的重要部分是通过和平委员会的社会成分变化实现的。为了正确评估这一过程，有必要更仔细地研究它。因为，正如在十七和十八世纪，“四分之一会议”既构成了地方贵族统治实践的背景，也展示了贵族统治实践的背景，尽管存在所有现有的差异，十九世纪的地方法官大会表达了超越贵族界限的阶级型统治利益发展的公众描绘——尽管这个过程的产生充满了冲突。在英格兰，统治能力也在资产阶级革命过程中被剥夺。尽管1832年和1867年的选举改革并未废除议会的贵族主导地位，但将其从保证的贵族统治权利减少到在选举程序中对特定社会群体的结构性偏好。正是在十九世纪最后三分之一世纪的这些制度化形式中，当地主的经济和社会地位大幅恶化时，未经重大制度变革就能实现人员的大范围更替。议会中旧制度的最终废除首先是以社会斗争的形式实现的，而不是作为对贵族统治剩余机构的攻击。在许多城镇也发生了类似的过程。在那里，1834年的法律变革并未废除贵族的主导地位和他们的统治形式，而是只有在经济前提条件改变的背景下的长期政治斗争才能实现。 在继续存在贵族主导的改革条件下进行人员更替的过程，还被集中化的过程所补充。老的地方统治形式并未被废除。但是，随着越来越多的新机构的创建——其被任命者来自不同的社会出身——地方行政受到中央政府机构更强烈的控制，这限制了治安法官的决策能力。后者的实践越来越多地局限于基于阶级的普遍公共秩序目的。 与英国情况相比，上升社会力量参与普遍化统治实践的前提条件在法国远不那么有利。尽管通过金钱和良好的关系可以获得行政和司法职务，但这并不意味着那些不谋求职务的第三等级成员有更好的机会推进他们的利益。在法国，统治权力的资产阶级化无法通过人员更替来推进。最终还是有显著的连续性。但是，在职权力成为特定利益——无论是贵族还是阶级利益的工具之前，必须先剥夺官员的职位。1789年之前，这只在金融行政的非常有限的领域发生。 甚至要求第三等级在计划中的贵族大会中获得广泛参与——与英国有利于富裕平民的选举改革的要求相当相似——在法国必然具有不同的政治意义。由于没有代表普遍化贵族利益的常规实践，1788年要求改变宣布大会中贵族配额的要求必然直接针对王权提出。因此，\\"加倍\\"运动批评了君主统治实践的既定结构。另一方面，在英国，选举改革运动是针对议会的，其内容是应该为代表此前受到不利的利益的政治团体提高选举成功的机会。选举改革的不利后果既不被期待也不被担忧。这是一种预测问题，其中一些预测显然是错误的，这表明在英国，制度改革的具体结果最终应归因于选举公众。\\"新人\\"不仅必须对抗过时的立法，同样也必须对抗选民愿意被传统权力形式——啤酒和火腿、赞助承诺甚至直接贿赂——所吸引的意愿。在英国，问题是新兴利益的主张，在法国，问题是首先要求能够使关于利益的政治斗争成为可能的制度。 新形式的占有中统治贵族的参与 英格兰改革旧制度为资产阶级社会的历史可能性的最重要前提之一，源于在放弃集中化占有的参与后，政治领导阶层的贵族能够保持经济领导地位的事实。尽管地主阶层已经受到农业收入相对下降的实质性影响，但许多高贵族家庭通常能够通过利用其拥有的对工业化必需的城市土地获利，以补偿农业变革的影响。在某种程度上，他们也参与了新的贸易公司和生产企业。在这个基础上，公共运动能够至少赢得相当数量政治活跃的贵族的支持，尽管当然并非全部。通过决定放弃特权，他们设法保持了进一步半个世纪的政治主导地位——至少在个体巨大财富的政治重要性和贵族文化的霸权仍然不可动摇的情况下。另一方面，地主阶层几乎由于新兴阶层的经济崛起和国家行政的专业化而丧失了他们的地位，最终甚至影响到了军队。然而，他们的自我意识能够在“拥有土地的生活”的文化理想和标有贵族特征的“女士”和“绅士”的行为规范的持续中生存下来。 在法国，改革的结构性前提条件要不利得多。尽管最近有关法国大革命的研究热衷于强调贵族改革的意愿，但在当前背景下，必须反驳与此相关的论述的事实是，正是贵族领导阶层的物质存在以某种方式与王室的相当大的债务的持续有关。王室的债务使利息支付成为可能，它挫败了政府大规模回购官职财产以更有效控制官员的所有计划。确实，有贵族，尤其是高级贵族，投资于工商业企业，但对于贵族两个分支的上层家庭的大多数来说，参与集中化占有和利用领主占有权能是他们物质再生产的关键要素。 在那些经济状况仅使得在乡村过着不那么奢侈生活的贵族家庭中，随着他们的物质状况恶化和他们的儿子获得有利职位的前景下降，许多人更加坚持他们可以获得的特权。然而，与英国不同，正是在不那么富裕的地主贵族中，许多人要求废除贵族特权，或至少减少它们，因为他们认为这些特权主要惠及大地主。 在这两个王国中，对“国家机构”的改革要求攻击“既得利益”，这些利益长期确立并部分上受到法律保障。但在法国，相信统治阶层的社会地位只能以根本改革为代价才能维持的人的政治力量不足以战胜他们的贵族同侪。"},{"instruction":"请将“Residues In France as in England, the political rights of the working population long remained restricted in the nineteenth century; not only at the level of the state as a whole, but also in towns, there were legally sanctioned social limitations on the prospects of influencing political decisions. In the first half of the nineteenth century, individual noble families in both countries were able to defend their materially leading positions, and in both countries men with noble titles continued to be strongly represented in the stratum of leading political figures. But the question for noble families in France after 1789 was either to defend or maintain their social position in the context of a bourgeois society, while, in England, the question was one of the residues of estate ruling practice. If in France, noble families made use of wealth, connections, and the opportunities that a noble title offered, in England there was a survival of competences founded on feudal rule or on long-established practices of gen-eralised estate rule - these being especially important in local government. This difference is also noticeable in the persistence or ending of the cultural hegemony of the nobility. Though this cultural hegemony had already been exposed to serious criticism in France in the eighteenth century, and the way of life of the nobility had been so fundamentally disavowed in the course of the Revolution that it could not be re-established by the notables of the nineteenth century, in England certain components of the cultural hegemony of the nobility have persisted through to today. In France, Negroni maintained that the Revolution made all Frenchmen and Frenchwomen into nobles.7 From a population that Negroni estimates at that time at 34 million, 50 million would have now become noble. It is customary in France to take your trousers to a ‘Pressing des Princes' to be dry-cleaned, eat in a ‘Snack Royal’ or have a drink in a ‘Pub Ducal'. The houses of many French people are furnished in surprisingly ‘aristocratic’ style, and French children particularly favour comics with aristocratic themes. In this omnipresent aristocratic semantics, superior status is defined by ‘distinction’. Those ‘fine differences’ whose strategic significance Pierre Bourdieu revealed time and again are certainly important in all societies. In France, however, they are more important than anywhere else for the social interactions of everyday life. To be superior in France is expressed by ‘being different’. In England, where the revolutionising of the ancien régime into bourgeois state power took place through a merging of the former ruling estate with the new social groups, the differences are not fine but immense, and the establish-ment of ‘distinction’ is a far less formal process, being determined by aristo-cratic behavioural norms that are still transmitted. This is possible because the modes of behaviour expected of a ‘lady’ or a ‘gentleman’ emerged from an adaptation of England’s ruling estates to the bourgeois virtues of rational behaviour. The social forms in which the revolutionising of the English ancien régime into a bourgeois society came about also find expression in the fact that the French term bourgeois has to be used to describe individual members of the ‘middle’ class - an expression surviving from the time when the aristocracy was still indeed the ‘upper’ class. The fact that estate rule is transmitted not only in the wealth of many heirs, but also in dominant forms of political culture and patterns of social selection, has caused social scientists to ascribe capitalist crises in the societies under consideration here to residues from former times. For France, Negroni main-tains that capitalist values could be established only as a ‘counter-culture’, and for England, Martin J. Wiener explains the twentieth-century weaknesses of economic structure in terms of aristocratic traditions causing a decline in the risk-taking spirit of the English bourgeoisie.8 Any such thesis needs to be confirmed by reference to the exploitation of the working population both at home and in the colonies. And this has not been possible. Part Five The Organisation of Generalised Power: A Conceptual Framework for Historical Epochs The concepts of historical epochs I shall present in this section are both preconditions and results of this book. The assumption of a fundamental structural difference between bourgeois societies and the forms of organisation of rule that preceded them determined the problematic of the investigation; specification of the contents of these concepts and the proposal to introduce the ‘ancien régime' as a structural type resulted from the course of my research. I confine myself here to presenting the results, so will refrain from repeating a long process of debate with the concepts current in this field. In the present work, ‘feudalism', ‘ancien régime' and ‘bourgeois society' denote types of ordering of rule and society, the relevant structural features of which were widespread in large parts of Europe at particular times. Whilst the structural type ‘bourgeois society' acquired a certain extension beyond Europe by way of colonisation, this was not the case for ‘feudalism' or the ‘ancien régime'. There certainly were elsewhere forms of seigneurial power, armed aristocracies and processes of centralisation of ruling force. But I maintain that the structural context in which these social forms stood was so different from that in the medieval European ‘world' that the formal similarities of certain features are irrelevant. The structural types proposed here differ from conceptual types based on the classification of empirical features. They are not based on empirical phenomena, such as the 'decentralisation' of rule under feudalism or the for-mation of a standing army under the ancien régime, but, rather, on similarities in the underlying structural conditions for historical developments. To this extent, the concepts of historical periods used here are constructed in a similar way to those prevalent in the Marxist tradition since its founders: they are linked to a theory of historical development. But, whereas Marxist theoretical conceptions generally assume the same developmental dynamic in all the periods we are dealing with here - whether this dynamic is one of dev-elopment of the productive forces or of class struggles - the notions proposed here are based on a developmental dynamic specific to the particular epoch. The theoretical claim that I make in defining these structural concepts is different for the various epochs. I leave to colleagues more specialised in the study of these epochs the attempt to add yet another definition of 'feudalism' to an already numerous list. As far as this historical epoch is concerned, the following notes are designed only to avoid particular explanatory cul- de-sacs. My intention is simply to explain what I mean in talking of feudal rule and feudal power, including feudal power of appropriation. This, however, already assumes a theoretical system that justifies use of the term 'ancien régime’ as the hallmark of a historical structural type. A further limitation arises from the central question of this investigation. The conceptual definitions proposed here emphasise those structural moments ascribed special importance with respect to the historical preconditions for the development of bourgeois state power. This leaves out of consideration, for example, the fact that the cultural form of warfare that was central to feudalism resulted in specific conditions for the development of the culturally hegemonic relationship between men and women. Differences between developmental processes in Europe and elsewhere are also not explicitly discussed. I. Feudalism The ironic remark that Frederic William Maitland made in his lectures of 1887-8 still applies to many structural definitions of feudalism: in England, feudalism was not introduced by William the Conqueror but by a seventeenth-century historian, and it reached its apogee in the mid-eighteenth century.1 Ever since scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sought to explain the features of previous historical orders (their residues being still visible) with the help of social connections and patterns of thought that were characteristic of their own time, there have been countless attempts to define feudalism as a system. Two dominant patterns of interpretation can be dis-cerned, though each of these has been further differentiated. One tradition of scholarship pictures feudalism above all in terms of castles and knights, the other in terms of rebellious peasants. With certain exceptions, what both of these main orientations have in com-mon is that they construct feudalism after the model of bourgeois society. Even when the system of fiefs is discussed in terms of relations of personal right, the assumption is generally made that a realm of law exists independent of the personal practice of rule, just as reference to a characteristic connection of economic and extra-economic power under feudalism already assumes the existence of economics and politics as separate spheres. The conditions for structural change, the crises and decline of feudalism, are accordingly pursued either in terms of the structural context of feudal ties and their military organisation, or else that of land lordship. If representatives of a concept of feudalism oriented to the system of fiefs often see the extent and form of exploitation of peasants as not much more than an intermediate link in the structurally decisive relations among lords, for those oriented to land lordship as an organisation of relations of production, warfare frequently appears as no more than a free-time occupation of members of the ruling class, and, though religion is ascribed a comparatively great structural significance, this is not fundamentally different from that in any later epoch.”翻译为中文","output":"遗留问题 在法国和英格兰，工作人口的政治权利在十九世纪长时间受到限制；不仅在整个国家层面，而且在城镇中，法律上也对影响政治决策的前景设有社会限制。在十九世纪上半叶，两国的部分贵族家庭能够保卫他们在物质上的领先地位，拥有贵族头衔的男性继续在政治领袖层中占据重要地位。但是，1789年之后，法国贵族家庭面临的问题是要在资产阶级社会背景下捍卫或维护他们的社会地位，而在英格兰，问题则是贵族统治实践的遗留问题。如果说在法国，贵族家庭利用财富、关系网络，以及贵族头衔所提供的机会，那么在英格兰，基于封建统治或长期建立的普遍化贵族统治实践的权能得以延续——这些在地方政府中特别重要。 这种差异也体现在贵族文化霸权的持续或结束上。尽管这种文化霸权在十八世纪的法国已经遭到严重批评，贵族的生活方式在革命过程中被如此根本地否定，以至于十九世纪的显要人物无法重新建立，但在英格兰，贵族文化霸权的某些成分一直持续到今天。在法国，内格罗尼声称革命使所有法国男女成为贵族。根据内格罗尼的估计，当时3400万的人口现在已经有5000万成为贵族。在法国，人们习惯于把裤子送到“王子洗衣店”干洗，去“皇家小吃店”用餐或在“公爵酒吧”喝酒。许多法国人的家以令人惊讶的“贵族”风格布置，法国儿童特别喜欢主题是贵族的漫画。在这种无处不在的贵族语义中，高等地位被定义为“区别”。皮埃尔·布迪厄反复揭示的那些“微妙差异”的战略意义在所有社会中当然都很重要。然而，在法国，它们对日常生活的社会互动比在其他任何地方都更为重要。在法国，优越性是通过“与众不同”来表达的。 在英格兰，通过将旧的统治阶层与新的社会群体合并，将旧制度革命为资产阶级国家权力，差异不是微妙的而是巨大的，而且建立“区别”的过程远不那么形式化，这是由仍然传承的贵族行为规范决定的。这是可能的，因为对“女士”或“绅士”的预期行为模式源于英国统治阶层数百年来对资产阶级理性行为美德的适应。导致英格兰的旧制度向资产阶级社会革命的社会形式也体现在法国术语“资产阶级”用来描述“中产阶级”的个体成员上——这一表达来自于贵族实际上仍然是“上层”阶级的时代。 不仅在许多继承者的财富中，而且在政治文化的主导形式和社会选择模式中传递的贵族统治，促使社会科学家将所考察社会中的资本主义危机归咎于旧时代的残余。对于法国，内格罗尼坚称，资本主义价值观只能作为一种“反文化”建立，对于英格兰，马丁·J·韦纳将二十世纪英国经济结构的弱点解释为贵族传统导致英国资产阶级的冒险精神下降。任何此类论点都需要通过参考国内和殖民地工作人口的剥削来确认。而这一点尚未成为可能。 第五部分 普遍权力的组织： 历史时期的概念框架 我在本节将介绍的历史时期概念既是本书的前提条件又是结果。假设资产阶级社会和先于它们的统治组织形式之间存在根本性结构差异，确定了研究的问题；这些概念的内容的具体化以及提出将“旧制度”作为结构类型的提议，是我研究过程中的结果。我在这里仅介绍结果，因此将避免重复该领域当前概念的长期辩论。 在本作中，“封建制度”、“旧制度”和“资产阶级社会”指的是统治和社会的排序类型，其相关的结构特征在特定时期在欧洲大部分地区普遍存在。尽管“资产阶级社会”的结构类型通过殖民方式在欧洲之外获得了一定的扩展，但“封建制度”或“旧制度”并非如此。当然，其他地方也存在领主权力形式、武装贵族和统治力量集中化的过程。但我认为，这些社会形式所处的结构背景与中世纪欧洲“世界”的背景如此不同，以至于某些特征的形式相似是无关紧要的。 这里提出的结构类型不同于基于对经验特征分类的概念类型。它们不是基于经验现象，如封建制度下的统治“去中心化”或旧制度下常备军的形成，而是基于历史发展的潜在结构条件的相似性。 在这个意义上，这里使用的历史时期概念的构建方式与马克思主义传统自其创始人以来的方式相似：它们与历史发展的理论相联系。但是，尽管马克思主义理论观念通常假设我们在这里处理的所有时期都具有相同的发展动力——无论这种动力是生产力的发展还是阶级斗争——这里提出的观念基于特定时代的特定发展动力。 我在定义这些结构概念时提出的理论主张对于不同的时期是不同的。我将尝试添加另一个“封建制度”定义的任务留给更专业研究这些时期的同事们，因为已有的定义列表已经很多了。就这一历史时期而言，以下笔记仅旨在避免特定的解释死胡同。我的意图仅仅是解释我谈论封建统治、封建权力，包括封建占有权力时的含义。然而，这已经假定了一个理论体系，该体系证明使用“旧制度”作为历史结构类型的标志是合理的。 由于这项研究的中心问题，这里提出的概念定义强调了与资产阶级国家权力发展的历史前提相关的特殊重要性的结构时刻。例如，未考虑封建主义的文化战争形式导致男女之间文化霸权关系发展的特定条件。欧洲和其他地方的发展过程之间的差异也没有得到明确讨论。 I. 封建制度 弗雷德里克·威廉·梅特兰在1887-8年的讲座中所做的讽刺评论仍适用于许多对封建制度的结构定义：在英格兰，封建制度不是由威廉征服者引入的，而是由一位十七世纪的历史学家引入的，并在十八世纪中期达到顶峰。自从十七和十八世纪的学者试图借助自己时代的社会联系和思维模式来解释先前历史秩序的特征（其残余仍然可见）以来，已经有无数次尝试将封建制度定义为一个系统。可以区分出两种主导的解释模式，尽管每种都有进一步的细化。一种学术传统主要从城堡和骑士的角度描绘封建制度，另一种则从叛乱农民的角度出发。 这两种主要取向的共同之处，除了某些例外，是它们都是以资产阶级社会的模型构建封建制度的。即使在讨论封地制度时提到了个人权利关系，通常也会假设存在独立于个人统治实践的法律领域，就像提到封建制度下经济和超经济力量的特征性联系已经假设了经济和政治作为独立领域的存在。因此，封建制度的结构变化、危机和衰落的条件相应地要么是根据封建关系及其军事组织的结构背景来追寻，要么是根据地主制度。如果封地制度概念的代表往往认为农民的剥削程度和形式不过是封建关系中结构性决定性联系的中间环节，那么对于将地主制度视为生产关系组织的人来说，战争常常只不过是统治阶级成员的一种休闲活动，尽管宗教被赋予相对较大的结构性重要性，但这与任何后来时代并无本质不同。"},{"instruction":"请将“The concept of personal rule that I shall go on to explain is designed to avoid the pitfalls of these interpretative models, as well as grasping the most important preconditions for the structure-changing dynamic of feudal society. In defining the content of this concept, I shall confine myself to those relation-ships that - despite considerable regional differences - were developed and reinforced after the turn of the millennium. (A procedure that can be justified only in the context of the limitations formulated above.) In this connection, it is not only the question of the temporal beginning of the feudal epoch that is left out of consideration, or the usefulness of the division proposed by Marc Bloch into a first and a second feudal era. Two further questions contested by historians are also omitted: that of the causes and forms of those processes in the course of which the conditions of life of slaves and free peasants (i.e. those subject to military levy) were equalised, by the former being given land - on condition of providing labour services and dues - while the latter, or at least the majority of them, were subjected to the immediate ruling power of the lords. Pierre Bonassie, whose impressive inter-pretation Georges Duby follows, in many respects, in one of his last works,2 ascribes this development (for Catalonia) to the greater possibilities of enrich-ment that arose with the growth in population, the extension of agriculture and the spread of trade.3 The other question is that of the origin of the feudal nobility. For many parts of the continent, a tradition of rulership has been assumed that stretched from the merging of Roman senatorial lineages with German warrior leaders, via the Carolingian service nobility that arose from this, through to the magnates of the turn of the millennium. In many regions, a far-reaching identity between freedom and nobility is assumed. The fact that even Anglo-Saxon England saw the emergence of lineages of magnates and a stratum of peasants dependent on lords, is generally left out of account in these studies of the nobility. Even for the period after the millennium, it is scarcely possible to speak of 'societies' in the modern sense of the term. The mechanisms by which func-tional connections are reproduced in modern societies were lacking. Feudalism did, however, have mechanisms of integration: the armed competition for possession of power, and the unity of the feudal 'world' constituted by the rule of the church. In the development of a largely unitary canon law, the transmission of knowledge by the clerical estate, and - above all - the sanc-tioning by power of ideas about God and the world, good and bad, justice and injustice, generalisations arose that are presupposed in the use of the unitary notion of an epoch. Personal rule Ruling power under feudalism was the property of individuals. Because of the prevailing idea that royal rule or local seigneurial rule did not completely disappear with the death of the king or the local seigneur, and because the practice of particular forms of rule brought with it particular obligations, arguments appear time and again in the literature that assume rule already existed in an institutionalised form, independent of the person of the ruler. This practice is most clear in the use of the term ‘feudal state'. It is all too easily forgotten, as soon as the term ‘state' appears, that under feudalism there was not yet a sphere of rule that existed independently of concrete personal relationships. And, for this reason, it is undesirable to use the term ‘state' to sum up the customs involved in the practice of rule, the notion of the two bodies of the king, and the idea that rule can in a certain fashion outlast the lifespan of its owner. Rule was exercised in practice by the use of armed force, sacral power and judicial power, the first two of these being based on personal rule while the application of judicial power reproduced this, as also did the landlord and seigneurial power of appropriation. The personal character of rule is revealed in the bodily gestures of the rulers who commanded obedience. Rulership in the age of feudalism was not just the property of individuals, it was also directed at individuals. Gestures of submission or loyalty were demanded of them. The exercise of rule applied to persons not as isolated individuals, but as members of kinship groups. If the basis of personal rule changed, so too did the form of family. This connection will be indicated here just by a particular example, the fact that the basis of noble rule in land lordship led to rules of inheritance being important. Whereas the powerful had earlier lived in kinship associations (on the continent still in the Carolingian age) in which membership was transmitted by both the mother and father, the basis of noble rule in the hereditary seat of a lineage led to forms of kinship becoming important that were vertically transmitted - generally through the male line. A ‘side effect' of this development was the ‘invention' of illegitimacy. Only with the emergence of hereditary claims did the difference between legitimate descendants and extramarital offspring acquire its significance. Lineages continued to remain the ‘organisational' basis for the lords' strate-gies of appropriation and advancement down to the end of the ancien régime, as well as for those who sought to become lords. In the Middle Ages, however, a first important structural change already came about, to the extent that family associations everywhere lost their character as an organisational unit for the revenge of injustice practised against members of a lineage, and a generalised judicial power with de facto validity was established. This made possible a certain spatial and social separation between smaller (nuclear) fam-ilies, which, in the meantime, came to dispose of parts of the possessions that the lineage had appropriated, and that had come to be inheritable. (A process that was either permanent, or on condition of biological continuity in the male line.) Alan Macfarlane's thesis4 that a notion of individuality had established itself early on in England can be confirmed with respect to a separation of the rule of individual family heads vis-à-vis the lineage association. It is not how-ever, as Macfarlane believes, based on an already established capitalism, but rather on the far-reaching generalisation of monarchical power. Foundation of personal rule in armed force and sacral power Feudal rulership was regulated by right (better, perhaps, by custom), and by religious teaching. The gestures of rule referred to these contents. Yet ruling power was only reproduced in the practice of symbolic power if these gestures and words could be backed up if need be by force of arms. No matter how justly rulership was acquired, it was only valid in connection with an armed sanction that was either actually applied, or could potentially be so. Justice was not the basis of rule, but a function of it. This assertion holds especially for feudal relations in the strict sense. If lords were not in a position to actually withdraw fiefs when obligations were unfulfilled, then feudal right did not actually exist. In practice, however, kings could as a rule only assert their feudal rule if they had at their disposal more than just this power of enfeoffment. Alain Guerreau was thus led to the formula that feudalism, understood as a system of fiefs, ‘died in the arms of monarchy' before it could be fully implemented.5 Because of this conditional context, feudalism or feudal right did not have any developmental dynamic of its own; there were only widespread conceptions of personal obligation that might play a rule in competition for possession of power - or might not. The same went for the sacral character of ruling power. It pertained to a property of rulership, yet only to the extent that it could also be demonstrated in non-sacral force. At the start of the period under consideration here (around the year 1000), the sacral character of all ruling power existed to a certain degree indepen-dently of sanction by the church. A hundred years later, the Roman curia had managed to appropriate definitional authority over the sacral. This change - decisive for the development of the organisation of ruling power - was the result of struggles that the stronger territorialisation of rule had provoked. In the same way as the regularisation of appropriation through land lordship provoked conflicts in the relationship between king and emperor, this was also the case with the relationship between emperor and pope. The popes consistently challenged the legitimacy of the claim to universal rulership proclaimed by the emperor in the ninth century, as soon as they had succeeded, with the help of the Roman aristocracy, in establishing themselves as secular rulers and thus becoming partly independent of imperial protection. This development was expressed especially in the struggle over the right of investiture. Whilst the Roman curia had necessarily been prepared to accept a compromise solution - different for each kingdom - with respect to appro-priation by the exercise of church rule, it succeeded in acquiring control over the goods of salvation. Even this was never entirely complete.6 The popes nei-ther managed to forbid the anointing of kings, nor could they deprive kings of their ability to work miracles; in some places, the balance of power did not even allow them to force bishops to implement an excommunication that the pope had pronounced. The struggles between emperor, kings and pope were not of immediate relevance in giving religious practice in the villages a Christian inflection. Nor should the efforts or even the successes of Christian missionary work be too highly assessed. The Crusade movement, however, did acquire a tremendous scale, both geographically and socially. Even after the end of the investiture dispute, the ubiquity of the sacral con-tinued, but by the church maintaining its claim to sanction the most important means of symbolic ruling practice, and thus to a certain extent becoming an instance for managing the legitimisation of rule. In this way, it constituted itself as what we retrospectively describe as a secular power, supplying one of the structural preconditions for the objectification of power. ”翻译为中文","output":"我将要解释的个人统治概念旨在避免这些解释模型的陷阱，同时把握封建社会结构变化动态的最重要前提。在定义这一概念的内容时，我将仅限于那些关系——尽管存在相当大的地区差异——在千年之交之后得到发展和加强的关系。（这一做法只有在上述限制的背景下才能得到证明。） 在这方面，不仅忽略了封建时代开始的时间问题，或马克·布洛克提出的将封建时代分为第一和第二封建时代的划分的有用性。还省略了历史学家争论的两个进一步的问题：那些奴隶和自由农民（即那些服兵役的人）的生活条件通过前者被赋予土地（条件是提供劳动服务和税赋）而后者，或至少他们中的大多数，被置于领主直接统治之下的过程的成因和形式。皮埃尔·波纳西，乔治·迪比在他最后的作品中在许多方面遵循波纳西令人印象深刻的解释，将这一发展（对于加泰罗尼亚）归因于随着人口增长、农业扩展和贸易传播而出现的更丰富的致富可能性。第二个问题是封建贵族的起源。对于大陆的许多地区，假定了一种从罗马参议院血统与日耳曼武士领袖的融合，经过卡洛林王朝的服务贵族，直到千禧年转折点的大贵族的统治传统。在许多地区，自由和贵族身份之间存在着深远的一致性被假设为存在。即使在盎格鲁-撒克逊英格兰，领主依赖的农民地主阶层和领主阶层的出现，通常在这些关于贵族的研究中被忽略。 即使在千年之后的时期，几乎不可能以现代意义上的“社会”来谈论。现代社会中复制功能联系的机制缺失。然而，封建制确实有整合机制：夺取统治权的武装竞争，以及由教会统治构成的封建“世界”的统一。在大体上统一的教会法、神职阶层的知识传播以及——最重要的——对上帝和世界、善与恶、正义与不正义观念的权力制裁中，产生了用统一概念表示的时代所预设的概括。 个人统治 在封建制下，统治权力是个人的财产。由于普遍观念认为，国王统治或地方领主统治并不会因为国王或地方领主的死亡而完全消失，并且因为特定形式的统治实践伴随着特定的义务，文献中不时出现的观点假设统治已经存在于一种独立于统治者个人的制度化形式中。这种做法在使用“封建国家”一词时最为明显。一旦出现“国家”一词，就很容易忘记，在封建制下还不存在独立于具体个人关系的统治领域。因此，使用“国家”一词来概括统治实践中的习俗、国王的双重身体概念，以及统治以某种方式超越其拥有者寿命的观念是不可取的。 统治是通过武装力量、神圣力量和司法权力的实践行使的，前两者基于个人统治，而司法权力的应用则再现了个人统治，同样也适用于地主和领主的占有权力。统治的个人特征体现在要求服从的统治者的身体姿态中。封建时代的统治不仅是个人的财产，也是针对个人的。向他们要求表示屈服或忠诚的姿态。统治的行使不是针对孤立的个体，而是作为亲属团体成员的个体。如果个人统治的基础发生变化，家庭形式也随之改变。这一联系将通过一个特定的例子来说明，即贵族统治基于地主制导致继承规则的重要性。而先前强大者生活在以母系和父系双方传承的亲属协会中（在大陆上还处于卡洛林时代），贵族统治基于家族继承地位的基础导致了通过男性直系传承的亲属形式变得重要。这一发展的“副作用”是“非婚生子女”的“发明”。只有在出现世袭权利时，合法后代与婚外子女之间的区别才获得其意义。 家族继续保持领主的占有和晋升策略的“组织”基础，直到旧制度结束，也适用于那些寻求成为领主的人。然而，在中世纪，已经发生了第一个重要的结构变化，即家族协会普遍失去了作为对成员受到不正义报复的组织单位的特征，并建立了具有事实效力的通用司法权力。这使得较小的（核心）家庭在一定程度上能够在空间和社会上与家族协会分离，这些家庭及其后来能够继承的家族占有的部分财产（这个过程可能是永久的，或在男性直系生物连续性条件下）。艾伦·麦克法兰的论点认为，英格兰很早就确立了个体主义观念，可以通过家庭首脑相对于家族协会的统治分离来证实。然而，这并不是基于麦克法兰所认为的已经确立的资本主义，而是基于君主权力的广泛普遍化。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The gestures of rule referred to these contents. Yet ruling power was only reproduced in the practice of symbolic power if these gestures and words could be backed up if need be by force of arms. No matter how justly rulership was acquired, it was only valid in connection with an armed sanction that was either actually applied, or could potentially be so. Justice was not the basis of rule, but a function of it. This assertion holds especially for feudal relations in the strict sense. If lords were not in a position to actually withdraw fiefs when obligations were unfulfilled, then feudal right did not actually exist. In practice, however, kings could as a rule only assert their feudal rule if they had at their disposal more than just this power of enfeoffment. Alain Guerreau was thus led to the formula that feudalism, understood as a system of fiefs, ‘died in the arms of monarchy' before it could be fully implemented.5 Because of this conditional context, feudalism or feudal right did not have any developmental dynamic of its own; there were only widespread conceptions of personal obligation that might play a rule in competition for possession of power - or might not. The same went for the sacral character of ruling power. It pertained to a property of rulership, yet only to the extent that it could also be demonstrated in non-sacral force. At the start of the period under consideration here (around the year 1000), the sacral character of all ruling power existed to a certain degree indepen-dently of sanction by the church. A hundred years later, the Roman curia had managed to appropriate definitional authority over the sacral. This change - decisive for the development of the organisation of ruling power - was the result of struggles that the stronger territorialisation of rule had provoked. In the same way as the regularisation of appropriation through land lordship provoked conflicts in the relationship between king and emperor, this was also the case with the relationship between emperor and pope. The popes consistently challenged the legitimacy of the claim to universal rulership proclaimed by the emperor in the ninth century, as soon as they had succeeded, with the help of the Roman aristocracy, in establishing themselves as secular rulers and thus becoming partly independent of imperial protection. This development was expressed especially in the struggle over the right of investiture. Whilst the Roman curia had necessarily been prepared to accept a compromise solution - different for each kingdom - with respect to appro-priation by the exercise of church rule, it succeeded in acquiring control over the goods of salvation. Even this was never entirely complete.6 The popes nei-ther managed to forbid the anointing of kings, nor could they deprive kings of their ability to work miracles; in some places, the balance of power did not even allow them to force bishops to implement an excommunication that the pope had pronounced. The struggles between emperor, kings and pope were not of immediate relevance in giving religious practice in the villages a Christian inflection. Nor should the efforts or even the successes of Christian missionary work be too highly assessed. The Crusade movement, however, did acquire a tremendous scale, both geographically and socially. Even after the end of the investiture dispute, the ubiquity of the sacral con-tinued, but by the church maintaining its claim to sanction the most important means of symbolic ruling practice, and thus to a certain extent becoming an instance for managing the legitimisation of rule. In this way, it constituted itself as what we retrospectively describe as a secular power, supplying one of the structural preconditions for the objectification of power. The medieval church was an organisation of feudal rule and appropriation. At the same time, however, it was also the organisational form for the gener-alisation of practices of life in which people gave form to their vision of the order of all things - in the conditions of their particular life as determined by power. This was always necessarily a process that involved not only the lords, and analysis of feudal rule is therefore cut short if its religious regulations are seen simply as instrumental manipulations of noble interests by a church apparatus oriented to the nobility. The doctrines represented by the medieval church came into being through a lengthy adaptation to warfare (long contested within the church), the domi-nant cultural form of feudalism. The beginnings of this development are already to be found in St Augustine, but, as late as the ninth century, the use of armed force was still penalised in the books of penances. (A regulation that was also applied by the bishops who demanded penance from the Norman conqueror of England.) With the spread of the doctrine of just war, and its generalised application in the Crusade movement, the reforming papacy of the late eleventh century reversed this attitude of the church into its opposite. Now, all who took part in a Crusade were absolved of their sins. In this way, the church adapted to the cultural forms of the feudal aristocracy, but, at the same time, regulated these and turned warfare outward. This was a process that was all the easier to achieve in so far as many bishops and abbots had grown up as budding knights, trained in the use of weapons and stamped by the norms of knightly honour. The second determining context for the doctrinal edifice of the medieval church was the struggle with ever new heresies. Precisely because the church was two things, an organisation of feudal rule and an instance for the legiti- misation of ideas about a God-given order, criticism of existing conditions necessarily took the form of heresy, i.e. a practice of belief that threatened the foundations of church rule - at least in the eyes of the Curia. 'Heresies' were conceived in small circles of the educated, but borne by mass movements of the common people. Feudal forms of appropriation Under feudalism, appropriation was a component of ruling power. This means firstly that the analytical concept of feudal power encompasses the social form of appropriation, and secondly that there was no such realm as ‘the economy' that was distinct from the practice of power. This assertion has key importance in the theory of historical development, forbidding the simple transposition of ‘economic interests' back to a time in which what mattered was the reproduction of the status of lord, not just that of rich man. (It is quite pertinent, for example, to emphasise the aspect of armed appropriation that was linked with the Crusades. But it would be wrong to reduce the Crusades to this aspect alone. To remain at home and systematically dedicate oneself to exploiting the peasants might have been an economic alternative, but it was not a possible alternative for a knight.) Furthermore, the analytical conception of feudal rule implies that there was no developmental dynamic of a feudal mode of production that could develop outside of competition among lords - a competition that was shaped not by the market but by armed force. Its results were influenced by the degree of seigneurial appropriation, but in no way completely determined by this. Decisive for the possession of power were success in war, marriage, inheritance, the favour of a powerful lord, and other such factors. Conversely, however, the power that lords could bring into play in conflicts over the level and forms of extraction of ‘surplus' labour had its effect on the development of landlordism. This was even the case when - as a result of plagues - there was a general shortage of labourpower. Feudalism involved not just a particular connection of ‘political' and ‘economic' power, not a connection between two separate spheres, but rather a unitary reciprocal effect. So as to avoid the danger of a mental separation of the economic sphere, I use the term ‘feudal appropriation' to characterise all forms of appropriation that are structured by the lords' possession of power. In this sense, feudal appropriation comprises not only appropriation in the forms of land lordship, seigneury and fiefdom, but also appropriation by war, the appropriation form of marriage, and the use of trading privileges sanctioned by ruling power. In the second half of the eleventh century, some of the freemen summoned to the lords' levy managed to raise themselves into the stratum of lords. This was thus expanded into an aristocracy of warriors - with differing structures according to region. The precondition for this separation of warriors from rustici was a military development. The use of the stirrup - introduced by knights returning from the east - made it possible for knights to fight not just with light spears but with heavy lances. Maurice Keen describes the new ‘cavalry tactic' as follows: The spear or lance is tucked tightly under the right armpit, so that it remains steady, and gripped further back, with the left arm left free to handle reins and shield. Horse, rider and lance are thus gathered together into what has been called a ‘human projectile'. A body of horsemen thus armed can deliver at a massed enemy a hammer blow, whose effect depends on the momentum of the charge and the shock of the impact.7”翻译为中文","output":"武装力量和神圣力量的个人统治基础 封建统治受到权利（或更恰当地说，习俗）和宗教教义的调节。统治的姿态指向这些内容。然而，统治权力只有在这些姿态和言语可以在需要时通过武力支持的情况下，才能在象征权力的实践中得到再现。无论统治权是如何正当地获得，只有与实际使用或潜在可能使用的武装制裁相连时，才是有效的。正义不是统治的基础，而是它的一项功能。 这一断言尤其适用于严格意义上的封建关系。如果领主实际上无法在义务未得到履行时收回封地，那么封建权实际上就不存在。然而，在实践中，国王通常只有在掌握了超出封地权力之外的更多权力时，才能声明他们的封建统治。因此，阿兰·格罗被引导出一个公式，认为封建制度，理解为一套封地体系，在它能够完全实施之前“死在了君主制的怀抱中”。由于这种有条件的情境，封建制或封建权并没有自己的发展动力；只有广泛存在的个人义务观念可能在争夺权力的竞争中发挥作用——或者不发挥作用。对于统治权力的神圣特质亦是如此。它关乎统治的一种属性，但只是在它也能在非神圣力量中得到展现的程度上才有关。 在此处考虑的时期开始时（大约在公元1000年），所有统治权力在一定程度上独立于教会的制裁而具有神圣性。一百年后，罗马教廷设法掌握了对神圣性的定义权。 这一变化——对统治权力组织发展具有决定性意义——是由于统治的更强烈领土化而引发斗争的结果。就像通过土地领主身份规范化占有引发国王与皇帝关系中的冲突一样，帝皇与教皇之间的关系也是如此。教皇们始终质疑皇帝在九世纪宣称的普遍统治权的合法性，一旦他们在罗马贵族的帮助下成功地确立了自己作为世俗统治者的地位，从而部分独立于帝国的保护，就这样做了。 这一发展特别体现在对授任权之争中。尽管罗马教廷不得不准备接受一种折中解决方案——对每个王国都不同——就教会统治的行使所占有的权力而言，它成功地获得了对救赎品的控制权。即便如此，这种控制也从未完全完成。教皇们既未能禁止国王的受膏礼，也未能剥夺国王行使奇迹的能力；在某些地方，权力平衡甚至未能让他们强迫主教执行教皇已宣布的绝罚。 皇帝、国王和教皇之间的斗争对于使乡村宗教实践呈现基督教色彩并非直接相关。也不应过高评估基督教传教工作的努力或甚至是成功。然而，十字军运动确实获得了巨大的规模，无论在地理上还是社会上。 即使在授任权之争结束后，神圣的无处不在仍然持续，但是通过教会维持其对象征统治实践中最重要手段的制裁权利主张，从而在某种程度上成为管理统治合法性的一个实例。通过这种方式，它构成了我们回顾性描述为世俗力量的存在，提供了权力客观化的结构前提之一。 中世纪教会是封建统治和占有的组织形式。然而，与此同时，它也是人们在权力决定的特定生活条件下，对所有事物的秩序视角给予形式的生活实践的概括组织形式。这始终必然是一个过程，不仅涉及领主，因此如果将封建统治的宗教规定仅视为教会机构借向贵族导向的行为对贵族利益的工具性操纵，对封建统治的分析就会被切断。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A correlation exists between two variables when higher values of one variable consistently go with higher or lower values of another variable. Explanation: A correlation refers to a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. When two variables are correlated, changes in one variable are associated with changes in the other variable. The direction of correlation can be positive (both variables increase or decrease together) or negative (one variable increases while the other decreases). The strength of correlation can vary from weak to strong. Examples of pairs of variables that are correlated include: 1. Inflation Rate and Interest Rates: Generally, as inflation rates increase, interest rates tend to increase to curb inflation. 2. Smoking and Lung Cancer: There is a positive correlation between smoking habits and the risk of developing lung cancer. 3.

Positive correlation means that two variables tend to change in opposite​ directions, with one increasing while the other decreases. An example might be age and vision. D. Positive correlation means that there is a good relationship between the two variables. An example might be the diameter of a circle and its circumference.","output":"The correct answer is: A. Positive correlation means that both variables tend to increase (or decrease) together. An example might be shoe size and height. Explanation: Positive correlation refers to a relationship between two variables in which they both tend to move in the same direction. When one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase, and when one variable decreases, the other variable also tends to decrease. An example of positive correlation is the relationship between shoe size and height - in general, taller individuals tend to have larger shoe sizes. Now, let's define negative correlation: Negative correlation means that two variables tend to move in opposite directions. When one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease, and vice versa. An example of negative correlation is the relationship between hours spent watching TV and GPA. As the number of hours spent watching TV increases, GPA often decreases. Finally, let's define no correlation: No correlation means that there is no apparent relationship between the two variables. Changes in one variable do not cause any consistent changes in the other variable. An example of no correlation might be the relationship between the number of books in a library and the outside temperature - these variables are likely unrelated and do not show a consistent pattern of change based on the other variable."},{"instruction":"Determine whether the statement makes sense​ (or is clearly​ true) or does not make sense​ (or is clearly​ false).

Explanation: The degree of correlation between two variables is determined not only by the pattern or shape of the scatterplot but also by the strength and direction of the relationship shown by the data points. In this case, if the data points follow a nearly straight diagonal line with only a weak correlation, it suggests that while there may be a linear pattern visible in the plot, the relationship is not very strong. The weak correlation could indicate some variability in the data points around the line of best fit, which could result in a weak correlation coefficient despite the overall trend being visible.

Explanation: A nearly straight diagonal line on a scatterplot indicates that there is a linear relationship between the two variables being plotted. However, the strength of the correlation is determined by how closely the data points cluster around this line. If the data points follow a nearly straight diagonal line but spread out quite a bit or exhibit a lot of variability, it suggests a weaker correlation. A strong correlation would typically have data points clustered closer to the line of best fit.

Vietnam's economy started to struggle in 2023 with lower demand in key export markets weighing on its manufacturing industry, while there was an intense desire to keep the Vietnamese Dong stable at the expense of business borrowing. Thus, Vietnam's GDP growth is projected to be lower than that seen in 2022. As such, Vietnamese consumers started to tighten their budgets with many people reducing their spending on non-essential products such as coffee. Though consumers have continued to drink coffee some people have been drinking less as a way to save money. In response to the lower demand, key players in coffee such as Masan Group Corp and Nestlé Vietnam Ltd have been constantly deploying discounting activities at modern channels such as supermarkets and hypermarkets and online as a way to simulate consumer demand. When it comes to coffee in Vietnam sales are relatively evenly split between the retail channel and the foodservice channel. During the pandemic sales swung towards the retail channel as consumers were unwilling or unable to venture outside their home for long periods. However, now that the pandemic is over sales have been shifting back towards the foodservice channel. Nonetheless, after seeing double-digit growth in volume terms in 2022, the recovery of foodservice sales has slowed in 2023. Like retail sales, this is in part due to the slowdown in the economy and rising prices. However, foodservice sales have benefited from more consumers returning to the workplace, an increase in social engagements and a recovery in Vietnam’s tourism industry. Production shortfall leads to a sharp rise in the price of coffee beans Coffee production in Vietnam was negatively impacted in 2023 by high temperatures and drought which are linked to the impact of climate change. This is not just a local problem with there being a global shortage of coffee beans in 2023 due to poor yields in key regions such as India and Brazil. As such, this led to a sharp increase in the price of fresh coffee beans but which also put significant pressure on the production cost of fresh ground coffee and instant coffee. With manufacturers also facing an increase in other production costs this came at a challenging time, with there being pressure to contain price rises with locals already facing a sharp rise in the cost of living. The Vietnamese government has reduced the rate of VAT from 10% to 8% from 1 July to 31 December 31, 2023, as part of efforts to support businesses and companies and to ease the pressure on consumers. However, this has not been enough to prevent a significant increase in the price of coffee in 2023. As Vietnamese consumers are quite price-sensitive these price rises have negatively impacted demand in 2023 and therefore players are expected to look to avoid any further significant price increases in coffee, at least in the short term. Coffee continues to benefit from new product innovation Despite the challenges that have faced coffee producers in 2022 and 2023 the market has continued to see various product innovations, with these mostly focusing on flavour. For example, in July 2023, The Coffee Factory, a chain of specialist coffee shops in Vietnam, launched its new mint flavoured range of instant coffee mixes. This new product can be served hot or cold and adds the chain’s existing product lineup in instant coffee mixes which also includes hazelnut and cappuccino options. To help promote its range of instant coffee mixes The Coffee Factory ran various promotions during 2023 including an offer to buy two boxes of its mint and cappuccino instant coffee mixes as a bundle offer for VND99,000. In April 2023, Fes Vietnam Co Ltd added a new fresh ground coffee flavour to its MacCoffee Gold range to provide a stronger coffee taste. Another new launch under the MacCoffee brand in standard fresh ground coffee in 2023 was MacCoffee Cà Phê Ph? Rang Xay (street roasted coffee). Fresh ground coffee is usually sold in 200g or 500g pack sizes in Vietnam but this new product is being sold in single-portion sachets that are designed to be more affordable and convenient for consumers, which has helped to make its coffee more accessible to a wider audience. PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES Coffee is expected to see the better performance over the forecast period Coffee is expected to see a return to growth in retail volume terms over the forecast period while foodservice sales are projected to see a full recovery. Demand is likely to pick up as Vietnam’s economy rebounds and as consumer confidence is restored. Furthermore, sales should also benefit from the recovery of the country’s tourism industry as well as locals returning to more active lives away from the home both for work and leisure. The Vietnamese government is also expected to continue deploying initiatives to boost the economy and to encourage consumers to start spending again. For example, in October 2023 the Ministry of Finance consulted the authorities on making further cuts to VAT for the first six months of 2024, having previously reduced VAT from 10% to 8% for the second half of 2023. Consumers expected to show higher interest in fresh coffee Over the forecast, Vietnamese consumers are expected to show higher interest in fresh coffee including fresh coffee beans and standard fresh ground coffee. More and more fully automated coffee machines are being promoted and sold in electronics and appliance stores and through retail e-commerce platforms such as tiki.vn, Lazada.vn, and shopee.vn. These small appliances are becoming increasingly affordable, with many consumers purchasing these products during special sales events which have become increasingly common in Vietnam. The rising availability of coffee machines has led to a rising demand for the café experience at home, which in turn is boosting sales of fresh coffee. Nonetheless, fresh coffee beans are typically only available in specialist coffee shops, while the presence of these products in the retail channel is limited due to the fact consumers need to grind the beans in small batches for immediate use, which is seen as inconvenient and time consuming. Instead, when it comes to fresh coffee Vietnamese consumers usually purchase standard fresh ground coffee when shopping in the retail channel. As the economy improves consumers are likely to be keen to invest in a higher quality cup of coffee whether at home or in the foodservice channel and thus sales of fresh ground coffee are projected to see strong growth in total volume terms. Limited opportunities expected for pods, but local players and foodservice operators could carve out more share in the market Over the forecast period, the presence of fresh ground coffee pods will likely remain negligible in Vietnam due to the well-established culture and preference for drip coffee. Therefore, there is likely to be a reluctance to embrace more modern approaches such as coffee pods. In addition, when considering the cost per cup, coffee pods tend to be pricier than purchasing fresh coffee beans or standard fresh ground coffee. Moreover, with the widespread availability of specialist coffee shops and a strong coffee culture in Vietnam, consumers can easily purchase fresh coffee drinks in various options from expresso, cappuccino, and latte to drip coffee, all at a cheaper price than purchasing fresh ground coffee pods. The higher cost of these products compared to other coffee options is therefore likely to remain a major deterrent to price-conscious consumers. As Vietnam is able to grow and produce its own raw coffee beans, the forecast period is, however, likely to see the entry of more small domestic players into the market, as exemplified by newcomers such as Mr Viet, Shin Café, and Gunam. These local brands typically focus on distribution within a certain region or a niche segment, in order to differentiate themselves from their larger rivals. Indeed, an increasing demand for speciality coffee, as well as a growing consumer interest in where coffee is grown, should pay dividends for these smaller players. Foodservice operators, such as Phuc Long Coffee & Tea Co Ltd and Viet Thai International JSC (with its Highland brand) are also expected to focus on developing their offerings within their coffee shop outlets, as well as looking to take advantage of their strong brand names to expand further. | RTD Coffee In Vietnam Dec 2023 KEY DATA FINDINGS Off-trade volume sales grow by 4% in 2023 to 3 million litres Ajinomoto Co Inc is the leading player in 2023, with an off-trade volume share of 38% Off-trade volume sales are set to grow at a CAGR of 7% over the forecast period to 4 million litres 2023 DEVELOPMENTS RTD Coffee still has potential for growth in 2023 RTD coffee has continued to see steady growth in off-trade volume terms in 2023. Although RTD coffee is a relatively niche category, especially when compared to similar products such as RTD tea, it nonetheless appears to still have plenty of potential with it seemingly fitting with the increasingly modern lifestyles of Vietnamese consumers. Consumers usually purchase RTD coffee as a convenient and indulgent option to drink at home. However, the fast development and expansion of the convenience stores channel in Vietnam has also created new opportunities for the consumption of RTD coffee. Convenience stores are becoming increasingly popular among the younger generations in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. For example, consumers often purchase ready meals and soft drinks from convenience stores to consume when hanging out with friends. Convenience stores also typically operate 24/7 with most stores having a chilled section. As such, many consumers tend to purchase RTD coffee at convenience stores when specialist coffee and tea shops are closed. RTD coffee continues to face still competition fresh coffee Although RTD coffee continues to grow and develop at a steady pace it still faces significant obstacles to wider acceptance. For example, in general, RTD coffee continues to face still competition from cafés, specialist coffee shops and street vendors which benefit from the strong coffee culture in Vietnam. It is easy to buy a fresh coffee in a wide range of options ranging from black coffee to milk coffee, along with hot and iced coffee with these options typically having very affordable prices when purchased from specialist coffee shops and street vendors, which are present on every street corner in Vietnam. In addition, the majority of consumers usually prefer fresh coffee instead of RTD coffee, with the perception being that the former is more natural, healthier, fresher and often tastier. Importantly, RTD coffee is also generally more expensive than fresh coffee, which given the challenging economic environment is a significant obstacle to growth. Therefore, RTD coffee has struggled to win over consumers or capture their attention with most consumers still either opting for fresh coffee or other soft drinks options such as carbonates or RTD tea, for example. Birdy tops the rankings while e-commerce has to bring RTD coffee to a wider audience In terms of the competitive landscape, Ajinomoto Co Inc has extended its lead in RTD coffee in 2023, with its Birdy brand topping the rankings, closely followed by Viet Thai International JSC with its Highlands brand. King Car Co Ltd with Mr Brown and Nestlé Vietnam Co Ltd with Nescafé are the other notable players in what is a highly consolidated category with the remaining players accounting for a combined off-trade volume share of 4% as of 2023. The Birdy brand benefits from its local image with it being made from 100% premium Vietnamese Robusta coffee beans. It has also expanded its reach with its RTD coffee now being available on leading e-commerce platforms. The expansion of retail e-commerce in Vietnam has helped producers of RTD coffee to reach more consumers, with these products still having a limited presence in some areas of the country. During the pandemic more and more consumers became familiar with online shopping and although the pandemic is now over many continue to shop online, including when shopping for RTD coffee. Consumers residing in small cities and rural areas are often unable to purchase RTD coffee in their local stores and thus retail e-commerce platforms such as tiki.vn, Lazada.vn and shopee.vn have helped to expand the potential audience for these products. Many brands have official stores on these platforms through which they offer attractive discounts and promotions to encourage sales. PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES A positive outlook for RTD coffee Over the forecast period, RTD coffee is expected to see a stronger performance in off-trade volume terms compared to the one seen during the review period. This partly based on key players in the market constantly working to improve the taste of their RTD coffee as they look to provide a similar taste to the fresh coffee available from specialist coffee shops. As consumers lead increasingly busy lives and spend more time working there is likely to be a growing demand for the convenience of RTD coffee in Vietnam, which can be purchased on impulse for consumption on the go or stored at home as a quick option. In addition, RTD coffee is still a relatively immature category compared to other soft drinks categories, such as RTD tea and energy drinks, and therefore has much more potential for growth and development. Indeed, the leading players are expected to take advantage of the strong growth opportunities which will likely emerge during the post-COVID-19 period. As the Vietnamese economy rebounds and consumers become more willing to spend money on non-essential items this should encourage more people to buy RTD coffee, which could also find some appeal among tourists. Nonetheless, in actual terms, sales will still likely remain heavily restricted due to the strong competition that these products face from fresh coffee which is more affordable, more widely available and which is generally seen to be healthier and tastier. Health and wellness expected to have a growing influence on new product development Over the forecast period, it is likely that the burgeoning health and wellness trend will start to have a growing influence on RTD coffee. These products typically have a high sugar content and this could prove an obstacle to growth as increasing numbers of Vietnamese consumers start to pay more attention to their overall wellbeing, especially with regard to the amount of sugar they put into their body. Therefore, reduced sugar RTD coffee products are expected to be introduced into the market. In addition, cold brew RTD coffee could be launched in the market backed by the expansion of the convenience stores channel, with these outlets having chilled sections which would be capable of storing these products. Cold brew RTD coffee could appeal to those consumers who are seeking less sweet and more nuanced speciality coffee flavours. Key players focus on product innovation to attract consumers’ interest The demand for coffee in Vietnam is constantly increasing as consumers become increasingly sophisticated and look for a wider range of flavours and experiences. The growing competition being seen in RTD coffee has therefore led companies to prioritise product innovation as they look to stand out on retailers’ shelves. As such, during the forecast period, RTD coffee is anticipated to witness an increase in the introduction of new products looking to cater to the growing demand from consumers with more refined preferences. One potential strategy for RTD coffee brands to consider is offering flavours that are inspired by popular or trendy flavours found in speciality coffee shops. This could include unique options such as salt coffee, mint coffee, coconut coffee, and more. Players are also likely to focus on the quality of the coffee beans used in their RTD coffee, as well as the packaging, as part of efforts to win the attention of consumers. However, with the average unit price of RTD coffee already being relatively high in comparison with other categories in soft drinks, it remains to be seen to what extent consumers will be prepared to pay extra for exotic flavours and other innovations.","output":"In Vietnam, as of December 2023, the coffee market has navigated through an intricate landscape of growth, challenges, and burgeoning opportunities. Retail value sales of coffee escalated by 6% to reach VND11.3 trillion, with instant standard coffee emerging as the top performer, witnessing a 7% surge in sales to VND2.9 trillion. Amid economic contractions and rising inflation, consumer caution has slightly dampened retail volume sales, leading to strategic discounting by leading players like Nestlé Vietnam Co Ltd, which dominates with a 38% share. A notable trend is the gradual shift of sales back to the foodservice channel post-pandemic, despite challenges stemming from an economic slowdown and increased living costs. Exacerbated by climate change, a production shortfall prompted a sharp rise in coffee bean prices, further straining the costs for producers. In response, the Vietnamese government's VAT reduction from 10% to 8% for the latter half of 2023 aimed to alleviate pressure on consumers and businesses, although price sensitivities continue to impact demand. On an innovative front, the market has seen new entrants and flavors, responding to a growing consumer appetite for diverse coffee experiences. Over the forecasted period, the market eyes resurgence as the Vietnamese economy and consumer confidence are expected to recover. The increasing interest in fresh coffee, propelled by the affordability of coffee machines and a boom in RTD (Ready-To-Drink) coffee, reflects a shift towards convenient, yet quality, coffee consumption at home and on-the-go. Furthermore, the coffee sector may witness more localized and specialized offerings, with fresh coffee beans and innovative RTD products catering to nuanced consumer preferences for health, wellness, and specialty flavors, shaping the future trajectory of Vietnam's vibrant coffee landscape."},{"instruction":"Market research is typically conducted in response to a wide range of management decision problems and business activities.

Playwright — это фреймворк для автоматизации действий в веб-браузерах, который поддерживает работу через API с такими браузерами как Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, и WebKit. Этот инструмент предоставляет возможность выполнять широкий спектр веб-автоматизации, от открытия страниц и до сложных сценариев пользовательского взаимодействия с веб-страницами. В данном контексте, \`new_context()\` создает новый контекст браузера. В контексте браузера можно воспринимать как изолированную сессию.

Они позволяют Python выполнять асинхронные операции, такие как выполнение сетевых запросов, чтение и запись в файлы, и т. д., без блокирования основного потока выполнения программы. Вот подробнее о каждом из этих ключевых слов: # async \`async\` используется для объявления функции как \\"асинхронной\\" (асинхронной функции). Асинхронная функция — это функция, выполнение которой Python может приостанавливать (и возобновлять позже), пока она ждет завершения операций, не требующих активного участия процессора (например, I/O операции). Когда вы определяете функцию с \`async\` (например, \`async def my_function():\`), эта функция при вызове возвращает специальный объект \\"задачи\\" (англ. \\"task\\"), который может быть исполнен асинхронно. Это значит, что сама функция не выполняется сразу же при ее вызове. Вместо этого для ее выполнения используются специальные средства, такие как цикл событий (event loop). # await \`await\` используется внутри асинхронной функции для ожидания результата операции, которая также должна быть асинхронной. Выражение с \`await\` заставляет Python \\"подождать\\", пока асинхронная операция, стоящая после \`await\`, не будет завершена. Во время этого ожидания цикл событий может переключаться на выполнение других задач. Это ключевое преимущество асинхронности: вместо блокировки выполнения вашей программы она может продолжать делать что-то еще, пока ждет. # Как это работает вместе Представьте, что у вас есть функция, которая делает запрос к веб-сервису. Это обычно занимает какое-то время, в течение которого ваша программа, если она написана в синхронном стиле, просто будет ждать ответа, не делая ничего полезного. С асинхронной функцией Python может инициировать запрос, затем \\"отложить\\" выполнение этой функции и продолжить делать что-то еще. Когда ответ от веб-сервиса приходит, выполнение асинхронной функции возобновляется. \`\`\`python import asyncio async def fetch_data(): print(\\"Fetching data...\\") await asyncio.sleep(2) # Имитация асинхронной операции, например, запроса к веб-сервису print(\\"Data fetched\\") return {'data': 42} async def main(): result = await fetch_data() # Ждем завершения функции fetch_data print(result) # Запускаем цикл событий asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` В этом примере \`fetch_data\` является асинхронной функцией. Мы используем \`await\` для вызова \`asyncio.sleep(2)\`, который является примером асинхронной операции, имитирующей, например, время ожидания ответа от веб-сервиса. Это позволяет другим асинхронным операциям продолжаться, пока \`fetch_data\` ждет. Использование \`async\` и \`await\` позволяет писать асинхронный код, который выглядит и ведет себя похоже на синхронный, делая программу более читаемой и понятной, при этом повышая ее производительность за счет эффективного использования времени ожидания."},{"instruction":"т.е. в момент asyncio.sleep(2) у моей программы есть 2 секунды на другие действия?","output":"Да, точно! В момент выполнения \`await asyncio.sleep(2)\` в асинхронной функции, ваша программа действительно получает возможность выполнять другие задачи в течение этих 2 секунд ожидания, если такие задачи есть. Это одно из основных преимуществ асинхронного программирования. Давайте рассмотрим это подробнее. Асинхронный вызов \`asyncio.sleep(2)\` позволяет \\"паузить\\" выполнение функции, ждущей завершения операции (в данном случае, \\"ожидание\\" в течение 2 секунд), и отдать управление обратно в цикл событий (event loop) — механизм, который координирует выполнение асинхронных операций в Python. Цикл событий обрабатывает выполнение других асинхронных задач или функций, пока текущая задача ждет. Важно помнить, что цикл событий будет переключаться на выполнение других задач только если текущая задача явно \\"отдаст\\" управление, используя оператор \`await\`. Если в вашем асинхронном коде нет других задач, ожидающих выполнения в этот момент, то программа просто \\"пробудет в ожидании\\" до тех пор, пока время ожидания (в нашем примере, вызов \`asyncio.sleep(2)\`) не завершится. Поэтому, когда вы строите асинхронное приложение, особенно важно правильно организовать асинхронный код таким образом, чтобы максимально использовать преимущества неблокирующих операций, выполняя в \\"фоновом режиме\\" такие задачи, как обращения к базе данных, сетевые запросы и другие I/O операции, не заставляя всю программу ждать их завершения."},{"instruction":"как мне в playwright нжать на объект","output":"В Playwright, для того чтобы нажать на объект (кнопку, ссылку и т.д.) на веб-странице, можно использовать метод \`click(selector[, options])\` у объекта класса \`Page\`. \`selector\` представляет собой строку с селектором, указывающим на элемент для нажатия, а \`options\` — это необязательный параметр, содержащий дополнительные настройки для операции нажатия. Давайте рассмотрим простой пример использования метода \`click\` в контексте асинхронной функции: \`\`\`python from playwright.async_api import async_playwright async def run(): async with async_playwright() as p: browser = await p.chromium.launch() page = await browser.new_page() # Перейти на веб-страницу await page.goto('https://example.com') # Нажать на элемент с селектором '.some-button' await page.click('.some-button') # Закрыть браузер после выполнения действий await browser.close() # Запускаем функцию import asyncio asyncio.run(run()) \`\`\` В этом примере: - Сначала запускается браузер через Playwright и открывается новая страница. - Далее скрипт переходит на указанный URL ('https://example.com'). - После загрузки страницы выполняется нажатие на элемент страницы, который соответствует CSS-селектору '.some-button'. Этот селектор является примером, и вам будет необходимо его заменить на актуальный селектор, соответствующий элементу на вашей целевой странице, на который вы хотите нажать. Важно отметить, что операции страницы асинхронны, поэтому необходимо использовать ключевое слово \`await\` перед вызовами методов, которые выполняют асинхронные операции, такие как \`goto\`, \`click\` и т.д. Playwright также поддерживает различные типы селекторов, такие как CSS-селекторы, XPath, текстовые селекторы и т.д., что делает его гибким инструментом для автоматизации взаимодействия с веб-страницами."},{"instruction":"waiting for locator","output":"В Playwright, для обеспечения стабильности тестов и скриптов автоматизации, часто необходимо убедиться, что элементы полностью загружены и доступны для взаимодействия, прежде чем выполнять действия, такие как клики, ввод текста и так далее. Для этого можно использовать механизм ожидания, связанный с поиском элементов, а именно — использование метода \`wait_for_locator(selector[, options])\` или использование \`locator(selector).wait_for([options])\` для ожидания конкретного локатора. # Пример ожидания локатора перед нажатием: \`\`\`python from playwright.async_api import async_playwright async def run(): async with async_playwright() as p: browser = await p.chromium.launch() page = await browser.new_page() # Перейти на страницу await page.goto('https://example.com') # Ожидание локатора (элемента) до выполнения действия some_button_locator = page.locator(\\"button#some-button-id\\") await some_button_locator.wait_for() # Теперь, когда элемент, вероятно, полностью загружен и доступен, можно на него нажать await some_button_locator.click() # Дальше идут другие действия, например, проверка результата действия и т.д. # Закрыть браузер после выполнения действий await browser.close() # Запускаем асинхронную функцию import asyncio asyncio.run(run()) \`\`\` # Параметры и настройки: - \`selector\`: Предоставляет строку с селектором для поиска элемента.

Например, \`{timeout: 5000}\` ожидает элемент до 5 секунд. - \`state\`: Ожидаемое состояние элемента (например, \`'visible'\`, \`'hidden'\`). Использование механизма ожидания перед тем, как взаимодействовать с элементом, помогает избежать ошибок в тестах и скриптах, связанных с попытками выполнения действий над ещё не полностью загруженными или недоступными элементами страницы. Это особенно полезно при работе со сложными веб-приложениями, где элементы могут динамически загружаться в зависимости от пользовательского взаимодействия и других асинхронных процессов."},{"instruction":"мне нужно border выбрать как это сделать","output":"Для выбора или работы с CSS свойствами элемента, включая \`border\`, через Playwright, вам потребуется вначале найти элемент, а затем получить нужное CSS свойство этого элемента.

Давайте рассмотрим шаги, которые позволят вам получить значение свойства \`border\` у элемента. # Шаг 1: Найдите элемент Прежде всего, нужно получить локатор к элементу. Предположим, у вас есть элемент с классом \`some-class\`: \`\`\`python element = page.locator('.some-class') \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Получите значение свойства \`border\` Далее, вы можете использовать метод \`eval_on_selector\` или \`evaluate\` с локатором для выполнения JavaScript кода в контексте браузера, чтобы получить значение CSS свойства: \`\`\`python border_style = await page.evaluate('''(element) => { return window.getComputedStyle(element).border; }''', element) print(border_style) \`\`\` Если вам интересно получить конкретные стороны рамки (например, \`border-top\`), вы можете изменить \`.border\` на соответствующее свойство (\`.borderTop\`, \`.borderRight\`, \`.borderBottom\`, \`.borderLeft\`). # Пример полного кода \`\`\`python from playwright.async_api import async_playwright async def run(): async with async_playwright() as p: # Запускаем браузер browser = await p.chromium.launch() page = await browser.new_page() # Переходим на страницу await page.goto('https://example.com') # Ваш код поиска элемента element = page.locator('.some-class') # Получаем значение border border_style = await page.evaluate('''(element) => { return window.getComputedStyle(element).border; }''', element) print(border_style) # Закрытие браузера await browser.close() asyncio.run(run()) \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что для использования этого кода необходимо, чтобы элемент, значение CSS свойства которого вы хотите получить, был загружен на страницу.

Селекторы помогают Playwright точно идентифицировать, с каким элементом ему необходимо взаимодействовать. # Важно Прежде чем приступить к написанию кода, убедитесь, что вы имеете законное право на автоматизацию взаимодействия с сайтом и что это не нарушает условия его использования. # Определение селектора Селектор элемента можно определить, воспользовавшись инструментами разработчика в вашем браузере (обычно доступны через клавишу F12 или правый клик мыши по элементу и выбор \\"Исследовать\\" / \\"Inspect\\"). Вам нужно найти элемент, который отвечает за выбор пола, и скопировать его селектор — это может быть CSS-селектор или XPath-выражение. # Пример кода на Python с использованием Playwright Предположим, что у элемента, отвечающего за выбор пола, есть уникальный идентификатор или класс. Напишем пример кода, который иллюстрирует, как выполнить выбор пола: \`\`\`python from playwright.async_api import async_playwright async def select_gender_on_mailru(): async with async_playwright() as p: browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False) # Установите headless=True для скрытого режима page = await browser.new_page() # Перейти на страницу регистрации (примерный URL, он может быть другим) await page.goto('https://e.mail.ru/signup') # Допустим, у радиокнопки \\"Мужской\\" есть уникальный идентификатор \\"gender_male\\" await page.click('#gender_male') # Или если используется другой селектор, например, значение атрибута name # await page.click('input[name=\\"gender\\"][value=\\"male\\"]') # Добавьте остальные шаги регистрации здесь # Закрыть браузер после завершения всех операций await browser.close() # Запуск скрипта import asyncio asyncio.run(select_gender_on_mailru()) \`\`\` В этом примере предполагается, что у вас уже есть некоторые знания или информация о структуре страницы регистрации на Mail.ru, а конкретно — знание селекторов для элементов, отвечающих за выбор пола. Селектор в \`page.click('#gender_male')\` просто пример; в реальности селекторы могут отличаться.

Классы, как \`input-0-2-346\`, могут быть автоматически сгенерированными и изменяться при каждой загрузке сайта или при разных версиях сайта, что делает их ненадёжными для использования в качестве селекторов. Попробуйте использовать другие атрибуты HTML, которые более стабильны и предсказуемы, например, атрибут \`name\` и \`value\`. 2. **Ожидание Элемента**: Возможно, элемент ещё не загружен или доступен для взаимодействия в момент попытки клика. Убедитесь, что элемент полностью загружен, используя ожидание, прежде чем нажимать на него. 3. **Видимость Элемента**: Элемент должен быть видим для пользователя, чтобы осуществить на него клик. Если элемент существует в DOM, но фактически скрыт (например, стилями \`display: none\` или \`visibility: hidden\`), то нажать на него не получится. Предполагая, что у вас есть \`input\` элемент типа \`radio\` со следующим HTML: \`\`\`html <input class=\\"input-0-2-346\\" type=\\"radio\\" name=\\"gender\\" value=\\"female\\"> \`\`\` Чтобы выбрать этот радиокнопку с помощью Playwright, вы можете использовать селектор по атрибуту \`name\` и \`value\`, так как класс может быть динамическим и меняться: \`\`\`python await page.click('input[name=\\"gender\\"][value=\\"female\\"]') \`\`\` Полный код, который включает ожидание элемента перед нажатием, может выглядеть так: \`\`\`python from playwright.async_api import async_playwright async def run(): async with async_playwright() as p: browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False) page = await browser.new_page() await page.goto('URL_ВАШЕЙ_СТРАНИЦЫ') # Замените URL_ВАШЕЙ_СТРАНИЦЫ на фактический URL # Ожидание, пока элемент будет доступен для взаимодействия await page.wait_for_selector('input[name=\\"gender\\"][value=\\"female\\"]') # Нажатие на радиокнопку await page.click('input[name=\\"gender\\"][value=\\"female\\"]') # Дополнительный код await browser.close() asyncio.run(run()) \`\`\` Убедитесь, что URL вашей страницы корректен и что элемент доступен в момент выполнения клика. Если при выполнении кода возникают ошибки, проверьте консоль разработчика вашего браузера на предмет ошибок JavaScript или проблем с загрузкой страницы, которые могут мешать нормальному выполнению скрипта."},{"instruction":"как мне отследить что именно я нажимаю в браузере чтоб потом это вставить в playwright","output":"Для отслеживания ваших действий в браузере и создания скриптов Playwright на основе этих действий, можно использовать несколько подходов и инструментов. Один из самых эффективных способов — использование встроенной функции записи действий пользователя (User Flow) в Playwright. # Использование Playwright Inspector для записи действий Playwright предоставляет инструмент под названием Playwright Inspector, который позволяет запустить сценарий в режиме записи. В этом режиме вы можете взаимодействовать с веб-сайтом в браузере, а Playwright будет записывать ваши действия (как клики, ввод текста и т.д.) в формате кода. Для начала записи действий с Playwright, выполните следующие шаги: 1. **Установите Playwright CLI**, если вы ещё не сделали это. Это можно сделать через npm (Node.js Package Manager): \`\`\`sh npm i -D @playwright/test \`\`\` 2. **Запустите встроенный инспектор Playwright** для начала записи ваших действий в браузере. Откройте терминал или командную строку и введите следующую команду: \`\`\`sh npx playwright codegen \`\`\` После выполнения этой команды должно открыться окно браузера, где вы можете начать взаимодействовать с целевым веб-сайтом. Playwright будет записывать ваши действия в реальном времени. 3. **Интерактивно тестируйте веб-сайт**, выполняя необходимые действия, такие как клики по кнопкам, заполнение форм и так далее. 4. **Копируйте сгенерированный код**. По мере взаимодействия с сайтом в правой части экрана (или в отдельном окне, в зависимости от версии и настроек) будет отображаться код, соответствующий вашим действиям. Вы можете копировать этот код и использовать его в своих Playwright скриптах. Такой метод позволяет легко создать начальный набор команд для автоматизации тестирования, минимизируя необходимость вручную писать код для каждого действия. Обратите внимание, что полученный код может потребовать дополнительной оптимизации или модификации. Например, вам может потребоваться добавить дополнительные проверки состояния элементов или настроить ожидания элементов, чтобы сделать ваши скрипты более надежными и стабильными. # Дополнительные советы: - При необходимости уточнения селекторов вы можете использовать инструменты разработчика браузера (DevTools), доступные по нажатию F12 или через контекстное меню \\"Исследовать\\" (Inspect), чтобы получить более точные селекторы для элементов веб-сайта. - Используйте параметризацию и переменные для упрощения управления данными в тестах, например, для входных данных форм."},{"instruction":"please update your node.js","output":"Если вы столкнулись с сообщением \\"please update your node.js\\", это значит, что версия Node.js на вашем компьютере устарела и необходимо выполнить её обновление для корректной работы приложения или инструмента, который вы пытаетесь использовать. Вот несколько способов, как это можно сделать: # 1. Автоматическое обновление через NVM (Node Version Manager) Если вы используете NVM (Node Version Manager), что является рекомендуемым способом управления версиями Node.js, обновить Node.js очень просто. - Чтобы установить последнюю доступную версию Node.js, выполните команду: \`\`\`bash nvm install node \`\`\` - Для установки и использования конкретной версии Node.js используйте команду: \`\`\`bash nvm install <версия> nvm use <версия> \`\`\` - Для проверки установленных версий Node.js и выбора активной версии, используйте команды: \`\`\`bash nvm list nvm use <версия> \`\`\` # 2. Автоматическое обновление через NPM (Node Package Manager) Если у вас не установлен NVM, но установлен NPM, вы можете использовать пакет \`n\` для обновления Node.js. - Установите глобально пакет \`n\`: \`\`\`bash npm install -g n \`\`\` - Затем обновите Node.js до последней стабильной версии: \`\`\`bash n stable \`\`\` - Или установите последнюю доступную версию: \`\`\`bash n latest \`\`\` # 3. Обновление с сайта Node.js Вы также можете просто скачать новейшую версию Node.js с официального сайта [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) и установить её вручную. # 4. С использованием менеджеров пакетов в Linux Если вы используете Linux, то можете воспользоваться менеджером пакетов вашего дистрибутива для обновления Node.js. - Для Ubuntu и других основанных на Debian систем: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade nodejs \`\`\` - Для Fedora и других основанных на RHEL систем: \`\`\`bash sudo dnf upgrade nodejs \`\`\` - Для Arch Linux: \`\`\`bash sudo pacman -Syu nodejs \`\`\` После обновления версии Node.js рекомендуется перезапустить любые терминалы или командные строки, чтобы они воспользовались обновленной версией.

Проверяемый модуль или команда кажется несуществующей из-за опечатки в названии. Скорее всего, правильное название модуля или команды введено неверно. Если вы хотели импортировать модуль или использовать команду из npm (Node Package Manager), убедитесь, что название модуля введено правильно. Ниже представлены возможные шаги, которые можно предпринять для решения общих проблем, связанных с подобными ошибками. # Шаг 1: Проверка Названия Модуля Убедитесь, что имя модуля в команде или коде указано правильно. В сообщении об ошибке \\"npmli/cofnig\\" очевидно содержится опечатка.

No medication involved.","output":"A history of high blood pressure (hypertension) transitioning to consistently low blood pressure (hypotension) without the intervention of medication involves various potential factors. It's important to consider any changes in lifestyle, underlying health conditions, or other factors that might explain this shift. Here are a few considerations: 1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Significant lifestyle modifications, such as adopting a healthier diet (e.g., reducing sodium intake), losing excess weight, increasing physical activity, or reducing alcohol consumption, can lead to a natural decrease in blood pressure. 2. **Dietary Factors**: Changes in eating habits, like adopting a plant-based diet or increasing the intake of foods rich in potassium and magnesium, can also lead to lower blood pressure. Conversely, dehydration or a sudden decrease in fluid intake can cause hypotension. 3. **Change in Health Status**: The development of certain health conditions or the resolution of health issues that originally contributed to high blood pressure might result in lower blood pressure readings. These conditions can include thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, or heart problems. 4. **Age-Related Changes**: Blood vessels can become stiffer as people age, potentially leading to hypertension. However, in some people, the mechanisms regulating blood pressure might change in a way that leads to lower blood pressure readings over time. 5. **Psychological Stress**: Whereas chronic stress can contribute to long-term hypertension, a significant reduction in stress levels or improved coping mechanisms may potentially lower blood pressure. 6. **Natural Variations**: The body’s blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day and can be influenced by sleep patterns, physical activity, and even the temperature of the environment. A thorough investigation is required to ensure these lower readings aren't situational. 7. **Medicinal Side Effects**: Even if not prescribed for hypertension, other medications being taken for different conditions can have side effects that lower blood pressure. These include diuretics, certain antidepressants, or medications for Parkinson’s disease, among others. If there's a noticeable and consistent drop in blood pressure without an apparent cause, it's crucial to seek medical advice. Low blood pressure can lead to dizziness, fainting, and, in severe cases, shock. A healthcare provider can help determine the cause of this change in blood pressure and whether it’s a sign of an underlying health issue that needs attention. This would involve a review of medical history, a physical examination, and possibly some diagnostic tests."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Say what points you agree with. Add arguments for and against. It’s a fundamental debate in democratic countries: how should society punish murderers? Or terrorists? Or kidnappers? In the past capital punishment was used for many crimes. The Bible, for example, prescribed death for at least 30 crimes. During the Middle Ages capital punishment was especially popular. Burning alive, hanging, beheading, stoning to death, drawing and quartering were quite common. Today death penalty is used only for some crimes, most commonly for treason, murder, armed robbery and kidnapping. People disagree about whether capital punishment is moral or effective in preventing crime. Here are the most often used arguments for and against the death penalty: FOR: - People who take human life deserve to lose their own lives. - Capital punishment prevents crime because people are afraid of the consequences. The fear of death is more effective than the fear of prison. - Capital punishment is necessary because there are so many crimes, and prisons cost so much money. - Many murderers are mentally ill. If we put them in prison, they can escape and commit another crime. AGAINST: - Capital punishment lessens respect for human life. - There are other ways of punishing criminals. The fear of the penalty does not help to prevent crime. - We can’t always be sure that someone is guilty. People have been sentenced to death and later it was discovered that they were completely innocent. - Capital punishment isn’t used fairly. The poor and defenseless are more likely to be executed than the rich and powerful","output":". Arguments against capital punishment that I agree with include: - Capital punishment lessens respect for human life. I believe that every human life is valuable and that taking a life, even in the name of justice, diminishes the value we place on human life overall. - There are other ways of punishing criminals. I believe there are alternative forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, that can effectively ensure public safety without resorting to taking a life. - We can’t always be sure that someone is guilty. The possibility of executing an innocent person is a risk that I am not willing to take. The criminal justice system is not infallible, and there have been cases where innocent individuals have been sentenced to death. - Capital punishment isn’t used fairly. The fact that the poor and defenseless are more likely to be executed than the rich and powerful is a clear indication of the inherent biases and flaws in the criminal justice system. This inequality in how the death penalty is applied is a strong argument against its use."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For brevity and specificity, subsequent years (2001-2004) will be summarized with high-level highlights, particularly focusing on leaders by sales, cultural impact, or broad acclaim to address the error pointed out for games and to refine music and movie selections accordingly. # Guidance for Researching 2001-2004 To ensure the highest accuracy for the remaining years within your scope of interest, particularly since detailed verification for each year would extend beyond the capacity of a single response: - **For games,** annual sales data, critical acclaim, and fan community discussions often highlight top titles. Platforms like Metacritic, GameSpot, and IGN archives can provide year-specific insights. - **For movies,** Box Office Mojo and IMDb offer detailed box office figures and ratings, respectively, that can help identify the top films by both critical acclaim and commercial success for those years. - **For bands,** Billboard year-end charts are a valuable resource for identifying which acts dominated in terms of album sales, radio airplay, and streaming. Remember, the landscape was different, with fewer streaming options and digital sales just beginning to impact the market. This approach should allow for a focused, independent verification of top entities in each category for 2001-2004, ensuring information meets your specific criteria for popularity, sales, and cultural impact."},{"instruction":"Okay so do you remember when I said I don't want you to include solo artists and hip hop music?","output":"I apologize for the oversight regarding the inclusion of solo artists and not excluding hip-hop music in parts of my previous answers.

Limp Bizkit is a good reccomendation","output":"Certainly! If Limp Bizkit resonated with you and you're exploring other bands with a vibe akin to Linkin Park's *Hybrid Theory* and *Meteora*, here are more suggestions that blend nu-metal, rap-rock, and alternative metal elements. These bands and albums might further align with your tastes: 1. **Korn** - Often credited with pioneering the nu-metal genre, Korn's early albums like *Follow the Leader* and *Issues* might appeal to you for their heavy use of downtuned guitars and a blend of aggressive and melodic elements. 2. **Rage Against the Machine** - Known for their politically charged lyrics and a fusion of rap and metal, albums such as *The Battle of Los Angeles* offer a raw, energetic sound. 3. **System of a Down** - Offering a unique take on nu-metal with their album *Toxicity*, they blend unconventional structures, varied vocal styles, and socially conscious lyrics. 4. **12 Stones** - Their self-titled debut album incorporates elements of post-grunge and nu-metal, reminiscent of Linkin Park’s melodic but edgy sound. 5. **Sevendust** - Albums like *Animosity* and *Seasons* showcase their mix of aggressive guitars, soulful vocals, and melodic choruses, sharing the emotional intensity found in Linkin Park's music. 6. **Ill Niño** - Their debut *Revolution Revolución* blends nu-metal with Latin influences, offering a rhythmic and melodic sound that complements the era of *Hybrid Theory* and *Meteora*. 7. **Staind** - While often associated with post-grunge, their album *Break the Cycle* offers a mix of heavy and soft elements that might appeal to listeners of Linkin Park’s earlier work. 8. **Trust Company** - The band's debut album *The Lonely Position of Neutral* offers an accessible blend of nu-metal and alternative rock with catchy hooks. 9. **Hoobastank** - Particularly their self-titled album and *The Reason*, which while leaning more towards alternative rock, share the melodic appeal of Linkin Park. 10. **Static-X** - Known for their \\"evil disco\\" sound, albums like *Wisconsin Death Trip* integrate industrial metal with nu-metal tendencies, presenting a harder edge that might intrigue fans of the genre. These bands and albums provide a mixture of aggression, melody, electronic infusion, and lyrical depth that defines much of the nu-metal and rap-rock from the late 90s and early 2000s.

It is often translated into English as \\"spiritual community,\\" \\"conciliarity,\\" \\"unity,\\" or \\"harmony.\\" Sobornost is derived from the word \\"собор\\" (sobor), which means an assembly or gathering, often used in relation to a church council or a cathedral, emphasizing the communal and collective aspect. This concept plays a crucial role in understanding the Russian worldview, especially in how it perceives the relationship between individuals, society, and the divine. Sobornost stresses the interconnectedness of all people, advocating for a community where each member lives harmoniously with others, sharing spiritual and moral values, in contrast to Western individualism. It emphasizes collective responsibility, mutual aid, and the spiritual unity of mankind under God. The idea of Sobornost has been influential in Russian religious philosophy, particularly in the works of the 19th-century Slavophiles, who saw it as a distinguishing feature of the Russian national spirit and Orthodox Christianity, in contrast to Western rationalism and individualism. It also found expression in the writings of philosophers and theologians such as Aleksey Khomyakov, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Sergei Bulgakov, who articulated it within broader discussions of ecclesiology, social ethics, and culture. Through Sobornost, Russian thinkers have sought to propose an alternative vision of societal organization and human relationships, one based on spiritual unity, collective harmony, and the transcendence of individual egos in the search for common truth and love. This idea has implications not just for theology and philosophy but also for Russian culture, social thought, and political ideology, influencing the way Russians conceive of community, authority, and the role of the Church in society."},{"instruction":"What does the suffix -nost mean in Russian?","output":"In the Russian language, the suffix \\"-nost\\" (нoсть) is used to form abstract nouns from adjectives or participles. It is akin to the suffixes \\"-ness,\\" \\"-ity,\\" or \\"-ism\\" in English, serving to transform a quality described by an adjective into a noun that represents the concept of that quality. This morphological feature allows for the creation of nouns that denote a state, condition, characteristic, or property of someone or something. For example: - \\"krasivyy\\" (красивый) means \\"beautiful\\", so \\"krasivost'\\" (красивость) means \\"beauty\\". - \\"molodoi\\" (молодой) means \\"young\\", so \\"molodost'\\" (молодость) means \\"youth\\". The suffix \\"-nost\\" is widely used in Russian to abstractly express qualities, states, or conditions, making it a fundamental tool in the linguistic expression of concepts, ideas, and philosophical or psychological states."},{"instruction":"What is the Russian word for Communism?","output":"The Russian word for \\"Communism\\" is \\"Коммунизм\\" (transliterated as \\"Kommunizm\\"). This term signifies the political and social system envisioned by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in which the means of production are owned communally, aiming to create a classless society where wealth and power are distributed equitably. The ideology of Communism played a central role in Russian history throughout the 20th century, particularly after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, which led to the establishment of the Soviet Union, a state based on Communist principles."},{"instruction":"What is 3/4th of 100?","output":"3/4th of 100 is 75."},{"instruction":"Translate 妮娜巧克力夢想城堡～光雕秀＆吉祥物登場","output":"Nina's Chocolate Dream Castle: Light Sculpture Show & Mascot Appearance"},{"instruction":"Translate 피노파밀리아 교육, 그 이상 피노파밀리아 시즌3 [월드옙 WORLD YEPP] 🎈피노파밀리아 시즌3 [월드옙 WORLD YEPP]🎈","output":"Pinofamilia Education, Beyond that Pinofamilia Season 3 [WORLD YEPP] 🎈Pinofamilia Season 3 [WORLD YEPP]🎈"},{"instruction":"What is the Korean word for \\"mascot\\" as in a costumed character?","output":"The Korean word for \\"mascot,\\" especially referring to a costumed character, is \\"마스코트\\" (masukoteu).

In South Korea, mascots are commonly used for promotional activities, sports teams, festivals, and various events, similar to their use in other countries."},{"instruction":"What is botulism?","output":"Botulism is a severe and potentially fatal illness caused by botulinum toxin, a powerful neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, and, in rare cases, by strains of Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii. This toxin is one of the most lethal substances known and can cause serious neurologic symptoms leading to paralysis. There are several forms of botulism, including: 1. **Foodborne botulism**: This is caused by consuming foods contaminated with botulinum toxin. Improperly canned, preserved, or fermented foods are typical sources of the toxin. 2. **Infant botulism**: This form occurs when infants ingest Clostridium botulinum spores, which can be found in soil and some foods, such as honey. The spores then colonize the infant's gut and produce the toxin. 3. **Wound botulism**: This occurs when the spores of Clostridium botulinum contaminate a wound, germinate, and then produce the toxin. 4. **Iatrogenic botulism**: This form can occur through the accidental overdose of botulinum toxin from cosmetic or therapeutic injections. 5. **Inhalation botulism**: While exceedingly rare and primarily of concern as a potential bioterrorism risk, this form would result from inhaling botulinum toxin. Symptoms of botulism typically begin with blurred vision, dry mouth, and difficulty swallowing or speaking, which can then progress to muscle weakness and paralysis. In severe cases, the diaphragm muscles can become paralyzed, preventing breathing and necessitating mechanical ventilation support. Early diagnosis and treatment with antitoxin (for non-infant forms) are crucial for improving outcomes. For infant botulism, specific treatments such as botulism immune globulin are available. Preventive measures for foodborne botulism include proper food handling, preparation, and preservation techniques. Honey and any products containing spores should not be given to infants under one year old to prevent infant botulism."},{"instruction":"Create a list of magic items for a diaper-centric D&D homebrew taking place in a setting where the usage of absurdly oversized diapers and other various infantile items (bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, etc.) are a necessity and a norm, not a fetish or a taboo, and are as universal as underwear is in our world. They simultaneously function as both cushy hip armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading', is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing as armor, either; many of them are so thick they can be repurposed as blankets, pillows, even poofy mattresses! And not just diapers; other protective wear has been replaced with their similar infantile counterparts. Why wear tough greaves when you can wear soft booties? Why wear leather gloves when you can wear silky mittens? Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency and DC determined by the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. The act of having accidents in diapers is natural, universal, and even endearing to some, and can occur at any time, even in one's sleep, particularly if someone is experiencing strong emotions, ranging from elation to fear. Each diaper has its own capacity and one being worn that has met it imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. Example 1: **Heavy-Duty Pamp of Poofing** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) While wearing this diaper, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack made against you hit the diaper instead, softening the blow and reducing the damage to you by 1d8 (minimum of 1). As an action, you can speak the diaper's command word and cause it to create a cloud of powder around you. The cloud of powder covers a 20-foot cube, which becomes heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Once used, this property can't be used until the next dawn. The huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as an improvised shortsword. Example 2: **Huggies of Hotness** Armor (diaper), uncommon (requires attunement) You and your companions within 10 feet of you gain resistance to cold damage while you wear this diaper. In addition, you and everything you wear and carry are unharmed by temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit. While wearing it, you can cast the *fire bolt* cantrip at will. This pamp, branded in decals of blue and purple flames, radiates a perpetual magical heat so potent the steam it constantly fumes melts snow and ice at the wearer's feet. Example 3: **Rattler of Cacophonies** Mace, rare This giant rattler jangles softly when wield. The rattler can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rattler has 1d4 + 1 charges, and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. On a successful hit, you can expend 1 charge to make the rattler emit a cacophonous noise. The target takes an additional 2d6 thunder damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become deafened for 1 minute. Example 4: **Lavenders of Self-Locking** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) This diaper produces a pleasant scent when worn, which spreads to fill a 30-foot cube centred on you and prevents the diaper from stinking when you Load it. All nonhostile creatures that can smell it have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. **Curse.** This item is cursed. Save for a small lock symbol imprinted upon the front, this diaper is otherwise identical to a heavy diaper. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or a *identify* spell reveals its curse. When you don this diaper, you can't doff it for 3d6 days or until you or the diaper is targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While you are attuned to this diaper, you have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist pooping. If you already had disadvantage on this type of saving throw, you fail automatically. Example 6: **Pacifier of Regression** Wondrous item (pacifier), legendary (requires attunement) While this pacifier is in your mouth, you understand and can speak Babyish and have proficiency in all diaper armor and infantile weapons. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and immunity to spells and effects that would sense your emotions, read your thoughts or detect your intelligence, such as the *detect thoughts* spell. **Curse.** This item is cursed. You have disadvantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom checks and saving throws while this pacifier is in your mouth. When you take a Short or Long Rest while attuned to this pacifier, make a DC 3 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save increases by 1. On a failure, you become 1d10 x 2 years younger and your Intelligence score takes a accumulative -1 penalty, to a minimum of 6. If your Intelligence is reduced to 8 or lower through the curse of this item, you must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw every 24 hours. On a failure, one of the following effects happen to you. The GM decides which, or rolls randomly and consults the following table. 1-3: You suddenly burst into tears and begin wailing loudly for 1 minute, incapacitating you for the duration or until someone uses their action to make a DC 15 Charisma check to calm you down. 4-5: You forget how to speak complex languages for 1 hour and are only able to speak and understand Babyish. You can't understand Common unless the words are short and spoken simply. 6-7: You lose the ability to stand and walk, falling prone and only being able to crawl for 1 hour. 8: You automatically fail passive Wisdom (Perception) checks made to notice the state of your diaper for 24 hours, and become stubbornly insistent that you don't need a change despite its state. A *remove curse* spell ends your attunement to this item, but any Intelligence lost through its curse can only be restored by means of a *greater restoration* or *wish* spell.","output":"These items craft an imaginative and distinct setting for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign that weaves together the fantastical elements of magic with the thematic niche of infantile gear. Here are additional items to complement the setting and provide a variety of game mechanics for players and GMs to explore: # Bonnet of Babbling Breeze *Wondrous Item (bonnet), uncommon (requires attunement)* This soft, plush bonnet is imbued with the gentle magic of the wind. While wearing this bonnet, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move silently. Additionally, as an action, you can command the bonnet to harness the wind's voice. For the next 10 minutes, any verbal communication you make can be carried and whispered to a target within 300 feet that you can see, so long as the air path between you and the target is unobstructed. # Booties of Boundless Bouncing *Wondrous Item (booties), rare (requires attunement)* These magical booties are as soft as clouds and as light as feathers. Wearing these allows the user to jump three times their normal jump distance and height without invoking attacks of opportunity. Once per day as an action, the wearer can activate the booties' true power to cast *jump* on themselves at the 3rd level, tripling their jump distance and height for 1 minute. # Bottle of Endless Warmth *Wondrous Item (baby bottle), very rare* This seemingly ordinary baby bottle is always filled with a warm, nourishing liquid. The liquid acts as both a comforting beverage and a meal, providing enough sustenance to sustain a person for a day. The bottle refills every morning at dawn. Drinking from the bottle requires an action, and upon doing so, a creature gains the benefit of having consumed a hearty meal and also heals 2d4+2 hit points. # Mittens of Mighty Grasping *Wondrous Item (mittens), uncommon (requires attunement)* These snug, fluffy mittens are enchanted to give its wearer improved manual dexterity and strength. The wearer gains a +1 bonus to Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Additionally, once per long rest, the wearer can activate the mittens' grip strength to gain advantage on one grapple check or climbing check. # Diaper of the Divine Doodie *Armor (diaper), legendary (requires attunement)* This divinely crafted diaper is adorned with runes and symbols of protection and purity. The wearer is granted a +2 bonus to AC. Additionally, the diaper has the following magical effects: - The wearer is immune to disease and poison. - As an action, can be activated to cast *purify food and drink* and *lesser restoration* with no material components required. Each of these effects can be used once per day. - The diaper magically cleans itself and the wearer from any soil or stain every hour. # Rattler of Joyful Jingles *Wondrous Item (rattler), uncommon* This magical baby rattler is filled with spirit-lifting magic. When shaken, it produces a joyful melody that can be heard by everyone within 30 feet. Allies within the range gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against being frightened or charmed for the next 10 minutes. This effect can only be used once per long rest. # Bib of Boundless Protection *Armor (bib), rare (requires attunement)* This thick, enchanted bib offers resilience to the wearer in the face of magical assaults. The wearer gains resistance to damage from spells. Additionally, once per long rest, when the wearer is subjected to an effect that allows them to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the wearer can instead choose to take no damage if they pass the saving throw, and only half damage if they fail. --- Each item presents opportunities for delightful roleplaying and strategy, fitting seamlessly into a setting that cherishes a unique cultural norm and challenges adventurers in surprisingly whimsical ways."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Without a specific context or question related to this text, it’s challenging to provide a meaningful response. If this text is meant to represent a code, cipher, puzzle, or any form of encrypted message, please provide more details about its origin or the type of assistance you’re seeking. For example, are you looking for help in decoding this message, understanding a pattern, or something else entirely? For effective assistance, please clarify the context or present a specific question related to this text. any word you see all above or not a single one? Based on the content provided in your previous messages, there are indeed recognizable words scattered throughout the text. The vast majority of the text appears to be a jumble of letters, punctuation, and sequences that do not form coherent sentences upon initial inspection. However, amidst this jumble, there are identifiable words and potential fragments of sentences. For example, in the most recent large block of text you provided, words like “chocolate,” “factory,” “river,” “golden,” “ticket,” “Willy,” “Wonka,” “Augustus,” “Gloop,” and more can be discerned, suggesting themes or references to the story “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” The presence of recognizable terms suggests that the text could be a form of puzzle or encoded message where certain words are hidden within a larger, seemingly nonsensical string of characters. Identifying a specific pattern, code, or method used to conceal or encode these words would require additional context or instructions. If you have a specific goal or pattern in mind, please provide further details to enable a more precise and helpful response. the fuck, gpt4? I apologize if my previous response seemed off-target or caused any confusion. It looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding the content and context of the input provided. I’m here to help, so if you have any specific questions or need assistance with a particular topic, please feel free to share more details. what motherfucking “Willy,” “Wonka,”? oompa-loompa-tibady-do, if you are wise you cannot get far. I’m sorry for the confusion earlier. It appears there was a misunderstanding in my response to your text. Your message doesn’t contain references to “Willy,” “Wonka,” or elements from “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” as mistakenly mentioned in my previous reply. If you have a specific question or topic you’d like to explore or discuss, please let me know how I can assist you further. can you detect at least one legit word up there or not? Upon reevaluation of the provided text, it’s clear my previous response was misinformed, as it incorrectly suggested content that wasn’t present. Given the complexity and randomness of the text in your query, accurately identifying coherent words without additional context was a challenge, and it seems there was a mistake in my attempt to provide a relevant response. The text you’ve provided appears largely random and without clear structure, but it does contain several recognizable English words scattered throughout, even though my prior response inaccurately referenced content not found in your submission. For example, words like “violet,” “dinner,” “school,” “river,” and many others can be found within the jumble. Each piece of the provided text might need individual attention to correctly identify all present words and possibly discern any intended meaning or pattern.

This breakdown will cover the architecture, activation functions, and some training configurations of the model. # Network Structure and Activation Functions - **DNN(B)**: This indicates a Deep Neural Network intended for Binary Classification. \\"B\\" presumably stands for binary, meaning the network outputs a single value intended to be interpreted as the probability of the input belonging to the positive class. The output is usually thresholded at 0.5 to make a binary decision. - **frs(1000)**: This could mean \\"feature size\\" of 1000, indicating that the input layer expects vectors of size 1000. This is an assumption based on the common usage of \\"frs\\" in some contexts, but without a universal standard, this could potentially stand for something else. - **[16(relu)-16(relu)-16(relu)-8(relu)-1(sigmoid)]**: This describes the architecture of the neural network in terms of neurons per layer and their activation functions. - **16(relu)**: Three hidden layers, each with 16 neurons using the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function. ReLU is used because it helps in reducing the likelihood of the vanishing gradient problem and allows the model to learn faster and more effectively. - **8(relu)**: A subsequent layer with 8 neurons, also utilizing the ReLU activation function. - **1(sigmoid)**: The output layer with 1 neuron using a sigmoid activation function. This is typical for binary classification tasks as the sigmoid function outputs a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of the input being in the positive class. # Training Configuration - **es(??)**: The \\"es\\" likely stands for \\"early stopping,\\" a technique to prevent overfitting by stopping training when a monitored metric has stopped improving. The \\"(??)\\" probably indicates that the specific parameters (like patience or the monitored metric) are not specified. - **bs(10)**: This stands for \\"batch size\\" of 10. During training, the dataset is divided into batches, and the network's weights are updated after each batch is propagated through the network. A batch size of 10 means that the network will update its weights after every 10 samples have been processed. # Summary You're specifying a binary classification deep neural network with an input feature size of 1000. The network comprises three hidden layers with 16 neurons each, followed by one layer with 8 neurons, all using ReLU as the activation function. The output layer uses a sigmoid function to predict the probability of the positive class. The training configuration hints include using early stopping to prevent overfitting and a batch size of 10 for updating the network weights. Without further context on \\"es(??)\\", it's unclear what the specific conditions for early stopping are, but typically, it would involve monitoring either the validation loss or accuracy, and stopping the training after this metric does not improve for a specified number of epochs."},{"instruction":"DNN(B)-frs(5000)-[12(relu)-8(relu)-8(relu)-1(sigmoid)]-[es(??)-bs(10)] run the DNN application with the following model structure DNN_test([12, 8, 8, 1], ['relu','relu', 'relu', 'sigmoid'])","output":"To run a Deep Neural Network (DNN) application as specified with the structure \`DNN_test([12, 8, 8, 1], ['relu','relu', 'relu', 'sigmoid'])\`, you would typically need a code environment set up with the necessary libraries for deep learning, such as TensorFlow with Keras or PyTorch. Below, I’ll give you an example of how you might set up and run this DNN structure using TensorFlow's Keras API, assuming you’re interested in creating a binary classifier as the structure suggests. # Preliminary: Install TensorFlow If you haven't already, you’ll need to install TensorFlow.

This code installs a simple densely-connected network with the architecture you described and demonstrates how you can utilize early stopping during training to prevent overfitting."},{"instruction":"if DNN(B)-frs(5000)-[12(relu)-8(relu)-8(relu)-1(sigmoid)]-[es(??)-bs(10)] compare to other model, what is your finding?","output":"Comparing the specified DNN model with others requires considering several factors including the task at hand (e.g., classification, regression), the complexity of the dataset, and the performance of alternative models. Without specific models for comparison, I can provide a general analysis based on common findings in machine learning and deep learning. # Model Overview The specified model is a binary classification deep neural network (DNN) configured with an input feature space of size 5000, and structured as follows: - **Input Layer**: Accepts 5000 features per sample. - **Hidden Layers**: Three hidden layers with 12, 8, and 8 neurons respectively, all using the ReLU activation function. ReLU is chosen for its efficiency and effectiveness in non-linear transformations, helping mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. - **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, suitable for binary classification tasks since its output can be interpreted as a probability belonging to the positive class. # Findings and Observations 1. **Model Complexity and Depth**: With three hidden layers, the model is relatively shallow compared to deeper networks used for more complex tasks (e.g., image recognition, natural language processing). However, for many tasks, especially tabular data classification, shallow networks can perform remarkably well and are more interpretable. 2. **Overfitting Concerns**: The use of early stopping (denoted as \`es(??)\`) indicates an attempt to mitigate overfitting, a common issue in DNNs where the model learns the noise in the training data instead of generalizable patterns. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the patience parameter and what metric is being monitored (e.g., validation loss). 3. **Batch Size**: A batch size of 10 is relatively small, which can be beneficial for generalization as it introduces noise into the learning process. However, smaller batches can also make the training process more time-consuming and result in a more erratic convergence path. # Comparative Analysis Compared to other models, here are potential findings: - **Versus Simpler Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)**: The specified DNN might outperform simpler models if the decision boundary is complex and non-linear. However, if the underlying pattern is simple, simpler models might be preferable due to their interpretability and lower training time. - **Versus Deeper or More Complex Networks**: For datasets with intricate patterns or high-dimensional data (e.g., images, text), deeper networks might perform better at the cost of increased computational resources and training time. The specified model, being relatively shallow, is more suited to datasets where overfitting is a concern or where model interpretability is valued. - **Versus Other Shallow Networks**: The performance would largely depend on how well-tuned the model is concerning its architecture (number of layers and neurons) and hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.). Experimentation and validation are crucial to find the optimal configuration. # Conclusion The suitability and performance of the specified DNN model compared to others depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the task. Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.), training time, and the model's ability to generalize to unseen data should be considered in any comparative analysis. Experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation are key steps in identifying the most effective model for a given problem. In sum, while the specified DNN is well-configured for a range of binary classification tasks, its relative performance can only be gauged through empirical testing and comparison against both simpler and more complex models tailored to the specifics of the problem domain."},{"instruction":"run the DNN application with the following model structure DNN_test([12, 8, 8, 1], ['relu','relu', 'relu', 'sigmoid'])","output":"Sure, I can guide you through running a DNN with the structure you've mentioned using a pseudo-code that utilizes TensorFlow and Keras, as these libraries provide a straightforward way to define and train neural networks.

However, we can discuss the theoretical aspects and potential strengths or weaknesses of each model based on their architectural choices. # Models Overview 1. **Model A**: DNN(B)-frs(5000)-[12(relu)-8(relu)-8(relu)-1(sigmoid)] with early stopping and batch size of 10. 2. **Model B**: DNN(B)-frs(5000)-[12(relu)-8(relu)-9(relu)-1(relu)] with early stopping and batch size of 10. 3. **Model C**: DNN(B)-frs(5000)-[12(relu)-8(relu)-8(relu)-8(relu)-1(relu)] with early stopping and batch size of 10. 4. **Model D**: DNN(B)-frs(5000)-[12(relu)-8(relu)-16(relu)-32(relu)-1(sigmoid)] with early stopping and batch size of 10. # Evaluation Criteria 1. **Output Activation Function**: For binary classification tasks, a sigmoid activation function in the output layer (as seen in Models A and D) is usually preferred because its output can be interpreted as the probability of the input belonging to one of the two classes. The use of a ReLU activation function in the output layer (as seen in Models B and C) is unconventional for binary classification tasks because its outputs range from 0 to infinity, which does not map well to a probability distribution. 2. **Layer Structure and Neuron Allocation**: - **Model A** maintains a consistent size before dropping to a single output neuron. It's a balanced approach, likely providing a good trade-off between learning capacity and overfitting risk. - **Model B** presents a slight increase in neurons in the third layer before the output. However, the unconventional output activation diminishes its suitability for binary classification. - **Model C** includes an extra hidden layer compared to Model A, with all hidden layers after the first having the same size. The additional layer could help with learning more complex representations but might also increase the risk of overfitting or require more data to train effectively. - **Model D** showcases a pyramid structure, where the number of neurons doubles in deeper layers, before concluding with a sigmoid output. This might be beneficial for capturing hierarchical patterns in the data but also poses a higher risk for overfitting compared to shallower models, especially with a significant increase in parameters due to the larger layers. 3. **Potential for Overfitting**: Larger models with more parameters (e.g., Model D) are typically more prone to overfitting, especially on smaller datasets. Early stopping (\`es(??)\`) is mentioned for all models to mitigate this, but the effectiveness depends on the monitoring metric and patience set for each case. # Conclusion Theoretically, without empirical testing: - **For conventional binary classification tasks**, Model A and Model D are more theoretically sound due to their use of sigmoid in the output layer. Between them, Model A might be more generalizable and less prone to overfitting than Model D, especially on smaller datasets or when the underlying patterns can be captured with simpler models. - **Model D** might be better suited for more complex datasets where the extra capacity (from the more significant number of neurons) can capture complex patterns without overfitting, assuming enough data is provided. Empirical testing, involving training each model on the same dataset, using identical training protocols, and evaluating them based on the same metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.), along with considerations of training time and resource consumption, would be essential to determining which model is indeed the best for your specific scenario."},{"instruction":"Bonjour, j'ai un problème de traduction en anglais \\"Le monopole de l'information est transféré à l'ennemi, qui a un boulevard devant lui.\\" \\"un boulevard devant lui.\\" quel est l'équivalent en anglais ?","output":"Pour traduire l'expression \\"un boulevard devant lui\\" en anglais, surtout dans le contexte que vous avez donné, on pourrait utiliser la phrase \\"has a clear path ahead\\" ou \\"has an open road ahead\\".

(bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, etc.) are a necessity and a norm, not a fetish or a taboo, and are as universal as underwear is in our world. They simultaneously function as both cushy hip armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading', is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing as armor, either; many of them are so thick they can be repurposed as blankets, pillows, even poofy mattresses! And not just diapers; other protective wear has been replaced with their similar infantile counterparts. Why wear tough greaves when you can wear soft booties? Why wear leather gloves when you can wear silky mittens? Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency and DC determined by the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. The act of having accidents in diapers is natural, universal, and even endearing to some, and can occur at any time, even in one's sleep, particularly if someone is experiencing strong emotions, ranging from elation to fear. Each diaper has its own capacity and one being worn that has met it imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. Example 1: **Heavy-Duty Pamp of Poofing** Armor (diaper), rare (requires attunement) While wearing this diaper, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack made against you hit the diaper instead, softening the blow and reducing the damage to you by 1d8 (minimum of 1). As an action, you can speak the diaper's command word and cause it to create a cloud of powder around you. The cloud of powder covers a 20-foot cube, which becomes heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Once used, this property can't be used until the next dawn. The huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as an improvised shortsword. Example 2: **Huggies of Hotness** Armor (diaper), uncommon (requires attunement) You and your companions within 10 feet of you gain resistance to cold damage while you wear this diaper. In addition, you and everything you wear and carry are unharmed by temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit. While wearing it, you can cast the *fire bolt* cantrip at will. This pamp, branded in decals of blue and purple flames, radiates a perpetual magical heat so potent the steam it constantly fumes melts snow and ice at the wearer's feet. Example 3: **Rattler of Cacophonies** Mace, rare This giant rattler jangles softly when wield. The rattler can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rattler has 1d4 + 1 charges, and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. On a successful hit, you can expend 1 charge to make the rattler emit a cacophonous noise.

However, assuming the context of a simple circuit, where perhaps a voltmeter is connected across the battery or a resistor in series with the battery, the reading of the voltmeter would typically reflect the voltage drop across the component it is connected across. Given a direct or simplified question, without specific details on the circuit complexity: 1. **Voltmeter across the battery (no external resistance mentioned or assumed ideal conditions):** The voltmeter would read the voltage supplied by the battery, which is 45.0 V. This is because, in ideal conditions (no internal resistance of the battery or negligible resistance), the voltage drop across the battery terminals is equal to the electromotive force (emf) of the battery. 2. **Voltmeter across a load/component in series with the battery:** If the component was the only one in the circuit and it was in series with the battery, the entire voltage drop across the circuit component would equal the total supplied voltage (again, assuming ideal conditions with no internal resistance in the battery), which means the voltmeter would again read 45.0 V. Without further details (like circuit complexity, the presence of multiple components, or the specific connection of the voltmeter), the assumption leads us to conclude: The voltmeter will read 45.0 V, assuming it's measuring the voltage directly across the battery or a single series component that accounts for the entire voltage drop of the battery."},{"instruction":"A wire is carrying a current of 0.25 amps.

(b) What if the books are different?","output":"To solve these problems, we deal with two separate combinatorial challenges. Let's address each one: (a) **5 Identical Books into 5 Identical Boxes (No Restrictions)**: This is a problem of **partitioning** an integer (representing the identical books) into a sum of integers (the contents of the boxes), where the order of the summands does not matter because the boxes are identical. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of partitions of the number 5. The partitions of 5 are as follows: - 5 - 4 + 1 - 3 + 2 - 3 + 1 + 1 - 2 + 2 + 1 - 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 This gives us **7** ways to pack 5 identical books into 5 identical boxes without any restrictions. (b) **5 Different Books into 5 Identical Boxes (No Restrictions)**: When the books are different, and the boxes remain identical, the scenario is akin to seeing the books as elements that can choose among the boxes. However, since the boxes are identical, we cannot use straightforward permutations or combinations. One way to approach this is to recognize that each book has 5 choices (corresponding to each box), making naïvely (5^5 = 3125) arrangements, but this counts each unique distribution of books as multiple arrangements due to the boxes being identical. This direct computation doesn't lead to the exact answer due to overcounting identical configurations. For distinct articles going into identical containers, there's no simple formula akin to the previous case; however, the correct approach involves breaking it down into cases based on the distribution patterns (such as 5-0-0-0-0, 4-1-0-0-0, 3-2-0-0-0, etc.), then calculating for each case. It's more efficient here to actually reason through each type of distribution and apply combinatorics: 1. All books in one box: **1** way 2. Four books in one box and one in another: There are (binom{5}{4}) ways to choose which four books go together, but since the boxes are identical, there's just **1** way overall (who goes into the first box doesn't matter). 3. Three books in one box, two in another: (binom{5}{3}) ways to select the three books, then the two are determined, totaling **1** way considering identical boxes. 4. Three in one, 1 in two others each: (binom{5}{3}) for the triplet, but the distribution is identical regardless of which book goes where after, so **1** way again. 5. Two books in two boxes, one in a third: (binom{5}{2}) for the first pair, and (binom{3}{2}) for the second pair, but due to identical boxes division, the unique layouts are fewer. For distinct outcomes, we use division to correct for identical sets, which requires precise calculation. For unique arrangements, however, this detailed breakout ignores the intricacies of identical box scenarios leading to overcounting or undercounting. 6. One book in each of 5 boxes: **1** way. Given the complexity introduced by the identical nature of boxes, each distribution needs a detailed breakdown, including corrections for overcounting identical arrangements. The actual enumeration involves a careful consideration of each case and a subsequent correction for duplicates, which is crucial for deriving an exact count. The direct application of combinations here is not straightforward because it doesn't directly account for the indistinguishability of the boxes. For a correct detailed approach that accommodates the intricacies of identical containers: - You should consider generating functions or apply specialized techniques from enumerative combinatorics that deal with distributing distinct objects into identical containers, which can complex given the constraints. - The description provided offers a starting framework but a detailed, accurate enumeration requires a nuanced approach unique to the \\"distinct objects into identical containers\\" problems. The correction or precise detailing should navigate around these specifics, and given that part (b) is more complex than a straightforward combinatorial formula would solve due to the identities of the boxes making traditional paths like simple multiplication fallible for exact distributions. Precise answers would ideally come from combinatorial principles or formulas specifically designed for non-distinguishable recipients, which might involve partition theory and careful case analyses beyond basic permutation/combination formulas."},{"instruction":"give me answer","output":"I realize the explanations earlier might have needed more clarity for direct answers. Here's a more streamlined response: (a) **5 Identical Books into 5 Identical Boxes with No Restrictions** For the case of placing 5 identical books into 5 identical boxes with no restrictions, a combinatorial object known as \\"Stars and Bars\\" can be used to find the solution. The formula derived from Stars and Bars theorem is: [ binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ] where ( n ) is the number of items to distribute (in this case, books), and ( k ) is the number of containers or boxes. Applying this to our scenario: ( n = 5 ) (books), ( k = 5 ) (boxes), [ binom{5 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = binom{9}{4} ] [ binom{9}{4} = frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!} = frac{9!}{4!5!} = 126 ] So, there are **126** ways to pack 5 identical books into 5 identical boxes with no restrictions. (b) **5 Different Books into 5 Identical Boxes with No Restrictions** This problem dramatically differs from the first due to the distinctness of each book, making it unsuitable for a simple Stars and Bars approach due to the identical nature of the boxes which complicates direct application of common combinatorial formulas. For different books into identical boxes, the enumeration becomes more intricate and doesn't directly lend itself to a basic formula like Stars and Bars due to the need to consider the indistinguishability of outcomes from the boxes' perspective. However, I previously erred in attempting to simplify a solution path that doesn't directly apply for detailed distributions such as \\"different objects into identical containers\\" without invoking advanced combinatorial designs or generating functions which can enumerate based on partitioning the books across various counts of boxes correctly, accounting for all distributions from \\"all in one\\" up to \\"one in each.\\" For an accurate, clear answer to part (b), unlike the straightforward calculation of part (a), the solution involves considering each possible pattern of distribution (1 book in 1 box, 2 in another, etc.) and carefully tallying these while avoiding overcounting identical distributions due to the indistinguishable nature of the boxes. This detailed breakdown surpasses a simple enumeration within this format, and I must clarify that there's not an easily applied formula like Stars and Bars without further subdivision into specific cases and detailed combinatorial reasoning. Thus, for (b), without applying specific advanced enumeration techniques directly here, we acknowledge the complexity and the necessity of addressing it through a nuanced approach that accurately represents distributing 5 different books into 5 identical boxes. Each possible distribution pattern (all in one box, 4 in one & 1 in another, etc.) needs a custom examination, which likely involves extensive case-by-case analysis or employing combinatorial tools that go beyond basic formulas, emphasizing the unique challenge presented by the constraint of identical containers and distinct items."},{"instruction":"Solve it like this:I got (a) correct.

Let's correct that with a more precise approach. In **2-2-1-0-0** (Two in one box, two in another, and one in another): Instead of trying to correct for overcounting divisions by (2!), the correct approach should recognize that, due to the boxes being identical, we're looking at how to distribute the books, not the boxes. The correct reasoning would be: First, we decide which book is going to be alone: there are ( binom{5}{1} = 5 ) ways to choose this book. For the remaining 4 books (to be placed in pairs across two boxes), there isn't actually a need to correct for the boxes being identical here because the calculation concerns selecting which books are paired together, not how those pairs are distributed between two identical boxes. Once the single book is chosen, the rest fall into two natural groups by themselves without the need for overcomplication through division for identical outcomes. Here, once you've selected the one book that will be on its own (5 options), the remaining 4 automatically divide into two groups because the boxes are identical—negating any concern about which specific pair goes into which box. Therefore, the correction: For choosing 2 books to go together and the other 2 automatically pairing, given that boxes are identical, your selection process only happens once with the set of 4 (after setting one book aside). However, the error was in the approach to sort these into identifiable boxes, which isn't needed. The corrected outlook focuses on selecting the single book, and the realization divides the remaining without requiring additional division for 'identicalness': So the corrected number for **2-2-1-0-0** shouldn't attempt a division for indistinguishability beyond choosing the single book out: - **2-2-1-0-0**: Simply choosing which book is alone gives us 5 ways (as this implicitly dictates the 2-2 partition among the remaining books in identical boxes). Thus, the correct reevaluation still primes on identifying unique distributions given the books' distinctiveness and the boxes' identical nature: 1. 1 (5-0-0-0-0) 2. 5 (4-1-0-0-0) 3. 10 (3-2-0-0-0) 4. 10 (3-1-1-0-0) 5. **5** (2-2-1-0-0) [Corrected from previous overcomplication] 6. 10 (2-1-1-1-0) 7. 1 (1-1-1-1-1) Adding them again with the corrected entry: - 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + **5** + 10 + 1 = **42 ways**. Therefore, the corrected total for distributing 5 different books into 5 identical boxes with no restrictions is **42 ways**. My earlier response was a mistake in this aspect; thank you for catching that."},{"instruction":"for 2-2-1-0-0 I got 30","output":"I appreciate your patience and diligence on this matter. Let's reassess the **2-2-1-0-0** case with more care to understand where the calculation of 30 ways comes from, given it appears there was an oversight in my prior correction. For **2-2-1-0-0** (Two in one box, two in another, and one in another), the partition describes placing 4 of the 5 books into two pairs across two boxes and having the remaining book in a box by itself. Here's the correct calculation step-by-step: 1. First, you select the book that will be alone. This is indeed a choice among the 5 books, but the selection here directly leads us into how we group the remaining books, not explicitly picking the lone book as previously framed. 2. The central concern is how we break down the grouping of the remaining 4 books into 2 pairs, given that the boxes are identical. Here, the permutation of pairs matters insofar as which books are together, but not which pair goes into which box due to the boxes' indistinguishability. For any 4 distinct books, there are a specific number of ways to divide them into 2 distinct pairs. To visualize, you can: - Pair a specific book (say A) with each of the other three (BCDE), yielding 3 pairs ([AB], [AC], [AD]). - Then, continue by considering the next book (B) and its potential pairs not already counted (avoiding BA, since AB has been counted; thus, [BC], [BD]). - Then, from what's left, pair C with its remaining option not paired (avoiding CA and CB, leaving [CD]). This yields 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 distinctive pairing options for any set of 4 books, which applies universally across any grouped selection, manifesting as 6 ways to organize 4 books into 2 pairs. Given the correction and recalculating with this perspective: - **Each of the 3 initial pairs ([AB], [AC], [AD])** sets aside one pair and leaves the other two books to fall into the other pair automatically. - **The next pairing option (BC, BD)** considers not the selection process for the lone book but ensures every pairing configuration among 4 books after one (the remaining, not considered in selection) is isolated. - **Lastly, [CD],** the final pair, is fixed after all above options are considered. 3. Considering the mistake in the mode of explanation, the clarity here is in recognizing every possible pairing among the 4 books after isolating one leads to: For **2-2-1-0-0**, the accurate calculation without unnecessary division simplifies to recognizing each book has an equal opportunity to be the one set aside in theory, but the **focus on how the remaining 4 books can be paired** (substantively 6 ways independent of the initial selection) translates into broader distribution possibilities in context. The error in prior clarification stemmed from misattributing the selection process and overcomplicating the division for indistinguishability. Given your figure: - If you start with dividing 4 books into pairs, yielding 6 unique pair configurations, and then consider the initial selection as separate from this, your outcome suggests a different analytical path. The corrected insight should be acknowledging the simple pathways to derive pairings among 4 books under the scenario: - **The error**: Misunderstood representation in calculation correction disregards detailed partitioning dynamics specific to combinatorial pair selections, misaligning with the correct approach to treat identical boxes and unique book pairings. Upon reevaluation and aligning with clarity— - The direct pathway based on arranging 4 books into 2 sets of 2 (yielding 6 pair combinations explicitly without the need for initial book selection segregation) indeed outlines **6 ways to pair any 4 books uniquely**. Upon this corrected reflection, I acknowledge the discrepancy and oversight in alignment with your figure. If we correctly understand the combinatorial base for **2-2-1**, combining insights without overcomplication indeed should reflect upon how each unique pairing across 4 leads us to recognizing distribution potentials, rather than conflating it with the initial choice segregation— Reflecting on the core query and correction: - Your indication of \\"30\\" for **2-2-1-0-0** arises from a distinct combinatorial pathway or miscommunication in calculation framing from the outset. The correct combinatorial enumeration dwells on the intrinsic pairing configurations for 4 books into 2 pairs (6 combinations), which does not multiply further by initial book selections for being alone due to intrinsic combinatorial enumeration mechanics, not directly yielding \\"30\\" in standard combinatorial logic for this scenario. The evolution in dialogue misaligns with combinatorial direct calculation for this distribution model. Realigning on the precise question and avoiding conflated interpretation, the initial correction aimed to refine understanding under the premise of identifying unique configurations for distributing 4 books into pairs under indistinguishable boxes, seeking to rectify the analytical pathway correctly. Your figure and subsequent discourse suggest a reinterpretation or distinct analytical frame potentially overlooked in my prior corrective attempt for **2-2-1-0-0**, warranting a more nuanced combinatorial dialogue."},{"instruction":"How many ways can we place 8 books on a bookcase with 5 shelves if the books are (a) indistinguishable copies (b) all distinct? Note that the position of the books on the shelves matter. Note that all books may be placed on the same shelf.","output":"When dealing with the placement of books on shelves, the distinguishability of the books and whether or not the position on the shelves matters significantly changes the approach for counting the arrangements. Let's break it down: # (a) Indistinguishable Copies If the 8 books are indistinguishable and can be placed on any of the 5 shelves, with the position of books on the shelves not differing (since the books are indistinguishable), we only care about the number of books per shelf. We can use the \\"Stars and Bars\\" approach (also known as \\"Balls and Urns\\"), where we have 8 indistinguishable stars (books) and we want to divide them into 5 groups (shelves). We can introduce 4 bars to create 5 distinct sections (one for each shelf). The total number of arrangements is then the number of ways to arrange these stars and bars. For n indistinguishable items to be distributed into k groups, the formula is: [ binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ] So, for 8 indistinguishable books onto 5 shelves: [ binom{8 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = binom{12}{4} ] [ binom{12}{4} = frac{12!}{4!8!} = frac{(12 times 11 times 10 times 9)}{(4 times 3 times 2 times 1)} = 495 ] Therefore, there are **495 ways** to place 8 indistinguishable books on 5 shelves. # (b) All Distinct If the 8 books are all distinct, and they can be placed on any of the 5 shelves with the position of the books on the shelves mattering, the problem becomes more complex. For each book, there are 5 choices (each shelf being a choice). Since there are 8 unique books and the choice for one does not affect the others (since they are distinct and positioning matters), we simply raise the number of choices to the power of the number of books: [ text{Number of ways} = 5^{8} ] [ 5^{8} = 390625 ] Therefore, if the books are all distinct and their position on the shelves matters, there are **390,625 ways** to place the 8 books on the 5 shelves."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He has a multifaceted view on AI issues, considering both the sociotechnical and legal dimensions. While I cannot provide a direct quote from James Grimmelmann indicating a singular \\"public stance,\\" his work broadly engages with how law interacts with new technologies, including AI. Grimmelmann's scholarship often delves into how technologies impact individual rights, societal norms, and the regulatory landscape. His writings and commentary suggest a balanced perspective on AI, advocating for thoughtful regulation and legal frameworks that protect individuals' privacy, prevent discrimination, and ensure that AI technologies are used in ways that are transparent, fair, and ethical. He has analyzed the challenges of governing AI technologies, including issues such as algorithmic bias, data protection, and the ethical development and deployment of AI systems. Specifically, his research has covered topics ranging from copyright in the age of AI, the ethical dimensions of digital consent, to the governance of online platforms which increasingly rely on AI for content moderation and curation. Through his work, Grimmelmann emphasizes the importance of legal scholars and policymakers understanding the technical aspects of AI to create effective and fair regulations. Given the rapid evolution of AI and its applications, Grimmelmann's views may evolve as well. It's advisable to consult his most recent writings or public comments for the most current stance on specific AI issues."},{"instruction":"Would he be described as anti-AI, pro-AI, or neither?","output":"Based on James Grimmelmann's body of work and public commentary up to my last knowledge update in September 2023, it would not be accurate to describe him as strictly anti-AI or pro-AI. His approach is more nuanced, focusing on analyzing and addressing the complexities and ethical considerations of AI and technology law without taking a blanket stance against or in favor of AI technology itself. Grimmelmann appears to advocate for a considered and informed approach to AI, emphasizing the need for regulatory frameworks that ensure AI technologies are used responsibly, ethically, and with attention to their social impacts. His work suggests a belief in the potential benefits of AI while also acknowledging and critically examining the challenges and risks associated with its development and application. This includes discussions on privacy, fairness, transparency, and the potential for societal harm. Thus, describing Grimmelmann as neither strictly anti-AI nor blindly pro-AI but as a thoughtful commentator on the nuanced legal, ethical, and societal issues raised by AI technologies would be more accurate. His stance is indicative of seeking a balance where AI technologies can be developed and utilized for the benefit of society while mitigating risks and protecting individual rights and societal values."},{"instruction":"What legal-based scholars who commonly write about AI issues would be considered the most anti-AI?","output":"Determining who might be considered the \\"most anti-AI\\" among legal scholars is complex due to the nuanced nature of academic discourse and the fast-evolving landscape of AI technology and its societal implications. Scholars commonly express concerns about aspects of AI, such as ethical considerations, biases, privacy infringements, and the need for regulation, rather than outright opposition to AI itself. Their critiques are usually aimed at fostering a more responsible and ethical approach to the development and application of AI technologies rather than opposing AI in totality. However, some scholars are known for their critical perspectives on technology, including AI, and while they might not necessarily be labeled as \\"anti-AI,\\" they raise significant concerns about the unchecked proliferation of AI and its potential adverse effects on society. For example: 1. **Frank Pasquale** - Pasquale is known for his work on the \\"Black Box Society,\\" which critiques the lack of transparency in AI and algorithmic decision-making systems. His concerns revolve around privacy, secrecy, and the opaque nature of AI systems that have significant power over individuals' lives and societal operations. 2. **Shoshana Zuboff** - Although more of a social psychologist and economist by training, Zuboff has written extensively on the implications of technology on society. Her concept of \\"surveillance capitalism\\" critiques how data collection and analysis, much of it driven by AI, are used to influence and manipulate behavior. Her work, while broader than legal scholarship, significantly influences legal and regulatory thinking about AI. 3. **Kate Crawford** - A senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research and co-founder of the AI Now Institute, Crawford has extensively critiqued various aspects of AI, focusing on social and political inequalities and injustices that AI systems can perpetuate or exacerbate. It's important to note that these scholars' critiques are typically aimed at fostering a more ethical, transparent, and equitable approach to AI rather than opposing the technology itself. They advocate for robust regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines to ensure AI technologies serve the public interest without infringing on rights or exacerbating social divides. Their work is essential in the broader conversation about how society approaches and integrates AI technologies."},{"instruction":"helo chat GPT4","output":"Hello!

The beginnings of this development are already to be found in St Augustine, but, as late as the ninth century, the use of armed force was still penalised in the books of penances. (A regulation that was also applied by the bishops who demanded penance from the Norman conqueror of England.) With the spread of the doctrine of just war, and its generalised application in the Crusade movement, the reforming papacy of the late eleventh century reversed this attitude of the church into its opposite. Now, all who took part in a Crusade were absolved of their sins. In this way, the church adapted to the cultural forms of the feudal aristocracy, but, at the same time, regulated these and turned warfare outward. This was a process that was all the easier to achieve in so far as many bishops and abbots had grown up as budding knights, trained in the use of weapons and stamped by the norms of knightly honour. The second determining context for the doctrinal edifice of the medieval church was the struggle with ever new heresies. Precisely because the church was two things, an organisation of feudal rule and an instance for the legiti- misation of ideas about a God-given order, criticism of existing conditions necessarily took the form of heresy, i.e. a practice of belief that threatened the foundations of church rule - at least in the eyes of the Curia. 'Heresies' were conceived in small circles of the educated, but borne by mass movements of the common people. Feudal forms of appropriation Under feudalism, appropriation was a component of ruling power. This means firstly that the analytical concept of feudal power encompasses the social form of appropriation, and secondly that there was no such realm as ‘the economy' that was distinct from the practice of power. This assertion has key importance in the theory of historical development, forbidding the simple transposition of ‘economic interests' back to a time in which what mattered was the reproduction of the status of lord, not just that of rich man. (It is quite pertinent, for example, to emphasise the aspect of armed appropriation that was linked with the Crusades. But it would be wrong to reduce the Crusades to this aspect alone. To remain at home and systematically dedicate oneself to exploiting the peasants might have been an economic alternative, but it was not a possible alternative for a knight.) Furthermore, the analytical conception of feudal rule implies that there was no developmental dynamic of a feudal mode of production that could develop outside of competition among lords - a competition that was shaped not by the market but by armed force. Its results were influenced by the degree of seigneurial appropriation, but in no way completely determined by this. Decisive for the possession of power were success in war, marriage, inheritance, the favour of a powerful lord, and other such factors. Conversely, however, the power that lords could bring into play in conflicts over the level and forms of extraction of ‘surplus' labour had its effect on the development of landlordism. This was even the case when - as a result of plagues - there was a general shortage of labourpower. Feudalism involved not just a particular connection of ‘political' and ‘economic' power, not a connection between two separate spheres, but rather a unitary reciprocal effect. So as to avoid the danger of a mental separation of the economic sphere, I use the term ‘feudal appropriation' to characterise all forms of appropriation that are structured by the lords' possession of power. In this sense, feudal appropriation comprises not only appropriation in the forms of land lordship, seigneury and fiefdom, but also appropriation by war, the appropriation form of marriage, and the use of trading privileges sanctioned by ruling power. In the second half of the eleventh century, some of the freemen summoned to the lords' levy managed to raise themselves into the stratum of lords. This was thus expanded into an aristocracy of warriors - with differing structures according to region. The precondition for this separation of warriors from rustici was a military development. The use of the stirrup - introduced by knights returning from the east - made it possible for knights to fight not just with light spears but with heavy lances. Maurice Keen describes the new ‘cavalry tactic' as follows: The spear or lance is tucked tightly under the right armpit, so that it remains steady, and gripped further back, with the left arm left free to handle reins and shield. Horse, rider and lance are thus gathered together into what has been called a ‘human projectile'. A body of horsemen thus armed can deliver at a massed enemy a hammer blow, whose effect depends on the momentum of the charge and the shock of the impact.7 This way of fighting demanded equipment, training and practice. It was beyond the reach of the majority of the peasants who had occasionally joined in military campaigns, and required lords to maintain young knights in their own households, and find various possibilities of maintenance for older knights outside the castle. They were also concerned to tie formerly independent knights to themselves by 'obliging gifts' or formal contracts. At the same time, these military developments demanded a regular - and more widespread - material basis for the lords' existence. The emergence of an aris-tocracy of 'professional' warriors went together with strategies for expanding the appropriation of lordly power. By the threatened and actual use of armed and judicial force, peasants were obliged to provide labour services and dues - in regionally differing forms. Whether lords based their demands on the peasants belonging to them life and limb, or on having conquered power of disposal over the land, or whether they claimed authoritative power [ban] over people who lived in a particular territory, was decisive for the form of exploitation, but not necessarily so for its degree. Independent of the specific grounds, what was involved was the develop-ment of 'institutions' of rule that were oriented to individuals and remained based on immediate structures of armed force. These were only formalised in the course of time, and there were scarcely any materialised structures like those in which institutions of rule are reproduced in modern societies. Yet the first signs of these did emerge. The donjon was both functional centre and sym-bol of castellania. The donjon differed from the modern materialisation of social relations chiefly because it presented the forcible character of ruling power in visible form. The bells that - increasingly from the thirteenth century - rang out the hours of prayer, work and leisure, proclaiming in this way the regulation by power of the divisions of the day, were a different matter. By this time, the social forms of feudal appropriation were already firmly established, and the church bells can be seen as the start of that comprehensive regulation of everyday life that characterises modern societies. In this regulation, rule in a certain sense hides behind functionality. Warfare was also a regular form of feudal appropriation. From an economic standpoint, this was simply robbery. The appropriators had not previously influenced the production process by the manner of their exactions (such as the demand for labour services, or the exaction of livestock on the death of a dependent), they rather enriched themselves from results of production that had already been appropriated, from possessions of lords or merchants and from the provisions of peasant families. The economic perspective however is insufficient here. Warfare was the dominant and generalised cultural form of feudalism, a culturally regulated deployment of armed force. Knights - and it is only to them that such behavioural norms applied - could obtain honour and wealth through war, but they could also be impoverished and lose their lives. There was no other sanctioning instance for these behavioural demands on warriors than the esteem of fellow warriors. They were therefore based, like many things under feudalism, in a prevalent mentality (a situation that Georges Duby especially stresses in his work). It pertained to the regulated practice of the use of arms that knights fought to the death only in exceptional cases, their more general aim being capture. Ransoming was a means of enrichment that was relatively rapid and could also bring fame - if the prisoner was of particularly high rank. Conversely, ransom demands could place lineages deeply in debt. If kings were captured, not only were all their vassals obliged to contribute to their ransom, but special dues and currency manipulations also affected merchants and peasants. That war was a regular form of acquiring fame and fortune is shown even in the fact that it was customary for exercises in weapons training to be made into feasts. A warrior who fell in a tournament could be taken prisoner, just as in a real battle, and be forced to pay ransom. In this way, poor squires and illegitimate sons of nobles were offered an opportunity to seek the material preconditions for their equipment as knights, and sometimes even for the ceremony of dubbing that later became rather expensive.”翻译为中文","output":"中世纪教会所代表的教义，是通过与战争的长期适应（这在教会内部长期存在争议）形成的，战争是封建主义的主导文化形式。这一发展的开端已在圣奥古斯丁身上找到，但直到九世纪，使用武装力量在忏悔书中仍被处以罚款。（这一规定也被要求诺曼征服者的英格兰主教实施忏悔。）随着正义战争教义的传播及其在十字军东征运动中的普遍应用，11世纪末期的改革教皇对教会的这一态度进行了彻底的逆转。现在，所有参与十字军东征的人都被赦免了他们的罪。通过这种方式，教会适应了封建贵族的文化形式，但同时，也对这些形式进行了规范，并使战争转向了外部。这一进程之所以容易实现，因为许多主教和修道院长都是作为准骑士长大的，在使用武器方面接受过训练，并深受骑士荣誉准则的影响。 中世纪教会教义建筑的第二个决定性背景是与不断出现的新异端邪说的斗争。正是因为教会是两个方面，即封建统治的组织和对上帝赋予的秩序观念合法化的实体，对现存条件的批评不可避免地采取了异端形式，即威胁教会统治基础的信仰实践——至少在教廷看来是这样。'异端'是在受过教育的小圈子里构思的，但是由普通民众的大规模运动所支持。 封建形式的占有 在封建制度下，占有是统治权力的组成部分。这首先意味着封建权力的分析概念包含了占有的社会形式，其次，没有一个称为‘经济’的领域与权力实践分离。这一说法在历史发展理论中至关重要，它禁止将‘经济利益’简单地迁移到一个时代，那时关键是再生产领主的地位，而不仅仅是富人的地位。（例如，强调与十字军东征联系的武力占有方面是非常恰当的。但将十字军东征仅归结为这一方面则是错误的。留在家中并系统地致力于剥削农民可能是一种经济替代方式，但对于一名骑士来说，这并非一个可能的选择。）此外，封建统治的分析概念意味着封建生产方式的发展动力不可能在诸侯之间的竞争之外发展——这种竞争不是由市场而是通过武力形成的。其结果受到领主占有权的程度影响，但绝不完全由此决定。拥有权力的占有是由战争成功、婚姻、继承、强大领主的青睐等因素决定的。相反，领主在冲突中所能发挥的权力对 '剩余' 劳动提取水平和形式的争夺也影响了地主主义的发展。即便是因疫情导致劳动力普遍短缺的情况下也是如此。封建制度不仅涉及‘政治’和‘经济’权力之间的特定联系，不是两个独立领域之间的联系，而是一种统一的相互作用。 为避免对经济领域进行精神上的分离，我使用‘封建占有’一词来描述由领主权力占有所结构的所有占有形式。在这个意义上，封建占有不仅包括土地领主、领主权和封地形式的占有，还包括通过战争、婚姻形式的占有和利用统治权力批准的贸易特权。 在十一世纪下半叶，一些被召唤到领主征兵的自由民设法提升自己进入领主阶层。这样，战士贵族就在各个地区形成了不同结构。这种分离战士和农民的先决条件是军事发展。骑士从东方回来引入的马镫，使骑士不仅能够使用轻矛，还能使用重矛作战。莫里斯·基恩（Maurice Keen）如下描述了新的‘骑兵战术’： 矛或长矛紧紧地夹在右腋下，以保持稳定，用左手更远处抓住，让左手有空来控制缰绳和盾牌。这样，马、骑手和长矛就结合成了所谓的'人体弹丸'。这样武装的一队骑兵可以对密集的敌人发起冲锋，其效果取决于冲锋的动能和撞击的冲击力。 这种作战方式需要装备、训练和实践。这对偶尔参加军事行动的大多数农民来说是无法达到的，并要求领主在自己的家中维持年轻骑士，为年长骑士在城堡外寻找各种维持方式。他们还关注通过‘礼物’或正式合同将原本独立的骑士绑定到自己身上。同时，这些军事发展要求领主存在的物质基础更加常规化——更加广泛。贵族战士的兴起伴随着扩张领主权力占有的战略。通过威胁和实际使用武装和司法力量，农民被迫提供劳动服务和税赋——形式因地区而异。领主对农民提出的要求是基于他们对生命和四肢的拥有，还是基于他们对土地的支配权，或者他们是否声称对特定领土上的人民拥有权威力量[ban]，对剥削的形式是决定性的，但对其程度并不一定如此。 不论具体理由如何，关键是针对个人并且始终基于直接武力结构的‘统治机构’的发展。这些仅随时间逐渐形式化，并且几乎没有像现代社会中那样规则制度重现的物质化结构。然而，这些的第一迹象确实出现了。堡垒既是功能中心也是城堡制度的象征。堡垒与现代社会关系的物质化主要不同之处在于，它以可视的形式展示了统治权力的强制性质。从十三世纪开始，越来越多的祈祷、工作和休闲的钟声响起，通过这种方式宣布了权力对一天各部分的调节，这与之不同。这个时候，封建占有的社会形式已经稳固下来，教堂的钟声可以被视为对现代社会日常生活的全面调节的开始。在这种调节中，统治在某种意义上隐藏在功能性背后。 战争也是封建占有的常规形式。从经济角度看，这简直是抢劫。占有者并未通过他们的索取方式（如要求劳务或在属下死亡时征收家畜）先前影响了生产过程，而是通过已被占有的生产成果、领主或商人的财产和农民家庭的储备来丰富自己。然而，从经济角度看这是不够的。战争是封建主义的主导和普遍化的文化形式，是对武装力量的文化调节使用。骑士——而只有他们适用这样的行为准则——可以通过战争获得荣誉和财富，但他们也可能因此变得贫穷并且失去生命。对骑士这些行为要求的唯一认可是来自战友的尊重。因此，就像封建主义下的许多事物一样，它们基于一种普遍的心态（这是乔治·迪比（Georges Duby）在他的作品中特别强调的情况）。属于武器使用的调节实践是，骑士只在特殊情况下才会战斗到死，他们的更普遍目标是俘虏。赎金是一种可以相对快速丰富自己并且也可以带来名望的手段——如果俘虏的级别特别高。相反地，赎金要求可以使家族负债累累。如果国王被俘，不仅所有他的附庸都有义务为他的赎金做出贡献，而且特别的税和货币操纵也会影响到商人和农民。战争是获取名望和财富的常规方式，甚至在武器训练练习被制成节日时也能看出。在锦标赛中倒下的战士可以像在真实战斗中一样被俘虏，并被迫支付赎金。这样，贫穷的侍从和贵族的非婚生子就有机会寻求作为骑士的物质前提条件，有时甚至包括后来变得相当昂贵的骑士受封仪式。"},{"instruction":"请将“By marriage, women were transferred from one household to another. Mar-riages served to reinforce or establish reciprocal relations of obligation between lineages, but they were also a means of appropriation. Just like participation in war, marriages could also be especially a matter of honour (in the case of a particular connection), and again like war, marriages involved appropriation not only as a by-product, but - at least among lordly lineages - as a central content of social practice. On top of these formal analogies, moreover, mar-riages were often integrated into the cultural form of warfare and compelled by force of arms. The English term ‘rough wooing' long denoted the forcible character of such marriages. This behaviour is still reported in the sixteenth century, its very characterisation giving it justification. I also count privileged trade among the feudal forms of appropriation - con-trary to most established research. Privileges were bestowed by lords on the basis of their armed force, and - at bottom - it was this force that also guaran-teed them. Mercantile appropriation - as distinct from petty local trade - thus stood in three senses in the forcible context of feudal rule: because longdistance traders had to be warriors themselves, because privileges excluded market competition or substantially limited this - a situation analogous to the structural barriers erected by landlord power to the rise of a market in labour or land -, and because the granting of privileges generated a form of income for the lords that rested on their possession of armed force and judicial power. The same judgement can be made of guild privileges. These however do not necessarily coincide with the foundation of guilds, and were often sanctioned by power only in the era that I refer to as the ancien régime. From the start of the period under consideration here, feudalism knew not only commodity production and long-distance trade, but also wage-labour and objectified structures of personal obligation. At an earlier date than was long supposed, knights held fiefs from more than one lord and thus could only conditionally pledge loyalty with their body and honour. Much earlier, too, mercenaries were employed, i.e. specialists in warfare who were hired for a single campaign and then paid off and dismissed. But during the whole epoch of feudalism, at least according to the thesis advanced in this work, the devel-opment of market and law remained subordinate to the structural context of the possession of armed force. This development altered to a very considerable extent the conditions for struggles over the form and extent of classtype appropriation, as well as those over possession of ruling power and the forms of its practice. But, under feudalism, there was still not the tendency to monetarisation and formalisation - i.e. rationalisation in the Weberian sense - that would later develop independent of the concrete practice of rule. To emphasise this connection, I count privileged mercantile and artisan pro-duction among the feudal forms of appropriation. Its bearing groups competed for shares in the appropriation of 'surplus' product with lords who enriched themselves from seigneurial rule and war, and sometimes competed also for possession of power - as when the urban burghers strove for rights. Differences of interest of this kind existed also among members of the aristocracy and nobility. Such differences among the possessors of landlord power are a feature of the organisation of feudal rule, not its underlying contradiction. Structural dynamic of feudal 'societies' In all feudal 'societies', material reproduction is limited by the social form of production. Increases in production chiefly resulted - as is generally agreed by scholars today - by the expansion of cultivated areas and the increased labour-power that was required for this. This kind of rise in production faces definite limits. Simple Malthusian models, however, are not appropriate, as the growth in population around the turn of the millennium can be explained equally by a change in the practices of biological reproduction arising from a changed organisation of appropriation (at least as regards the dissolution of latifundia), while the 'overpopulation' of the early fourteenth century can be seen as bound up with prospects of subsistence being confined by power. Nor was the level of development of the productive forces the only limit on agricultural productivity, this being also determined in particular cases by the manner of extraction. (Research has clearly shown in recent decades how the formerly widespread idea that seigneurial power remained largely external to the actual organisation of production is unsustainable.) These objections in no way alter the fact of the limited basis of material production in feudal 'societies'. Crises of material reproduction - and of biological reproduction in their wake - were a structural feature. This crisis structure initially had a cyclical character. Although the end of a crisis did not see the restoration of previous conditions, the structural change - such as for example the concentration of landholdings and the partial dissolution of seigneurial forms of appropriation - finds its explanation not in the specific dynamic of the mode of production itself, but rather in connection with competition for possession of ruling power. As an example to illustrate this situation, we can refer to the fact that at the time of the plague epidemics, which from the 1340s spread across large parts of Europe in deadly waves, peasants in England were able to achieve an easing of their obligations, owing to the lack of tenants, and many even managed to obtain their freedom. This was especially the case in manors whose owners could oppose to the peasants only their monopoly over the preconditions of their production, and was far less the case for lords who had forcible means of defending themselves against their rule being curtailed by a labour 'market'. In this way, though on the one hand seigneurial power was abolished, powerful monastic manors were able to make up for the losses that resulted from the decline in their number of workers by an increase in their demand for services and dues. They, too, finally succumbed to the effects of the Black Death - but only some four decades later. The structural dynamic of feudal societies is explicable above all in terms of competition for possession of power, and from the effects that the results of this had on the preconditions for social struggles over the extent of the 'surplus' product and the forms of its appropriation. Competition for possession of power increased over time the costs of its exercise in a double way, raising the costs of both the means of rule and of its personnel. These costs were expressed in money, for example the equipping of knights that became ever more onerous, and from the fifteenth century the costs of acquiring cannon and improving fortifications. The increasingly professionalised infantry did not only reduce the military importance of the battles of knights, it sealed the end of the feudal form of warfare. It equally meant that wars from now on required a financial basis that might be temporarily established by tactical alliances (such as the Hanseatic League) but, in the long term, was possible only for an established princely rule. The increase in the personnel costs of rule resulted first of all from military competition, i.e. the requirement of hiring mercenaries, arising both from the dissolution of vassal obligations and from the structural change in warfare. At the same time, the exercise of rule required an increasing degree of specialist legal knowledge. There were three reasons for this. Firstly, legally trained specialists were useful for unarmed (i.e. principally legal) conflicts among lords and for the conclusion of all those fiscal agreements that were a concomitant of the concentration of ruling competences; secondly, lords used the formalisation of their practice of rule in order to appropriate, with the help of their personnel, definitional competence over the local custom of rule (for-malisation, in the sense of a written fixing of rules, made it possible to deploy the knowledge of rulership against peasant interpretations of right and justice); thirdly, this was a successful strategy of social advance. Specialists in the unarmed exercise of rule (though they still resorted to weapons when need arose) were not only increasingly indispensable for reproducing the status of eminent lineages, they made themselves indispensable. The generalised social practice of specialists (today we would describe this as a strategy of profes-sionalisation) forced through the objectification of feudal rule. It also founded demands for maintenance and reward. The increasing costs of the exercise of rule affected lords to different degrees. Those who could scarcely afford to equip their sons as knights had no chance of taking advantage of the personnel now required. This also reduced their chances of reproducing their status as lords. At the same time, however, both individual families and entire social groups such as legal scholars (of whom many but no longer all were clergy, depending on the prevailing legal system) constantly pressed for social advance, as did well-to-do burghers. Their modes of action provoked strategies of defence: the concept of noble birth, and the anchoring of noble privilege in generalised rule. The constitution of the nobility as an estate not only put an end to the temporary expansion of magnate lineages into an aristocracy of warriors, but also to that epoch for which use of the term 'feudalism' - not a happy one, but established in scholarship - makes analytical sense.”翻译为中文","output":"通过婚姻，女性从一个家庭转移到另一个家庭。婚姻用于加强或建立宗族间的相互义务关系，但它们也是一种占有手段。婚姻参与就像参与战争一样，特别是一种荣誉的事情（在特定的联系中），再次像战争一样，婚姻涉及的占有不仅仅是副产品，至少在领主宗族中，占有是社会实践的核心内容。在这些正式的类比之上，婚姻经常被整合进战争的文化形式，并且被武力强迫。英文术语“粗暴的求爱”长期以来指的就是这种婚姻的强制性质。这种行为在16世纪仍然被报道，其特定的表述给予了它正当性。 我还将特权贸易归入封建占有形式——与大多数既定研究相反。特权是领主基于他们的武装力量授予的，归根结底，也是这种力量保证了它们的存在。与小规模地方贸易不同的是，商业占有在封建统治的武力背景下在三个方面具有特色：因为远距离交易者必须自身也是战士，因为特权排除了市场竞争或在很大程度上限制了竞争——这种情况类似于地主权力对劳动力或土地市场兴起设置的结构性障碍，以及因为特权的授予为领主创造了一种基于他们拥有的武装力量和司法权力的收入形式。对公会特权的评价也是如此。然而，这不一定与公会的成立相一致，往往只有在我所称的旧制度时代才被权力正式批准。 从我们考虑的这一时期开始，封建主义不仅知道商品生产和长距离贸易，还知道工资劳动和个人义务的客观化结构。比人们长期以来认为的更早，骑士从不止一个领主那里持有封地，因此只能有条件地承诺以身体和荣誉效忠。更早以前，就雇佣了雇佣兵，即专门从事战争且为单一战役雇佣然后支付报酬并解雇的专家。但是在整个封建主义时代，至少根据本作中提出的论点，市场和法律的发展仍然从属于武装力量占有的结构背景。这种发展在很大程度上改变了关于阶级型占有的形式和程度的社会斗争以及关于统治权力及其实践形式占有的条件。但是，在封建主义下，还不存在货币化和形式化的趋势——即韦伯意义上的理性化，这种趋势后来将独立于具体的统治实践发展出来。为了强调这种联系，我将特权商业和手工业生产列入封建占有形式。其承担团体与通过领主统治和战争致富的领主竞争‘剩余’产品的占有份额，有时也竞争权力占有——就像城市布尔乔亚争取权利时一样。这种利益差异也存在于贵族和贵族成员之间。这种领主权力拥有者之间的差异是封建统治组织的特征，而不是其基本矛盾。 封建‘社会’的结构动态 在所有封建‘社会’中，物质再生产受到生产的社会形式的限制。正如学者们今天普遍同意的，生产的增加主要是通过耕种面积的扩大和为此所需的劳动力增加实现的。这种生产增长面临确定的限制。然而，简单的马尔萨斯模型并不适用，因为千年之交人口增长同样可以通过占有组织的改变所引发的生物再生产实践的变化来解释（至少就解散大庄园而言），而14世纪早期的‘人口过剩’可以被视为与被权力限制的生存前景相关联。农业生产力的发展水平也不是农业生产率的唯一限制因素，这在特定情况下还由提取方式确定。（近几十年的研究清楚地表明，以前广泛的观点即领主权力在很大程度上对实际生产组织保持外部是不成立的。） 这些反对意见丝毫不改变封建‘社会’物质生产基础有限的事实。物质再生产的危机——以及其后的生物再生产危机——是一种结构性特征。这种危机结构最初具有周期性特征。虽然危机结束并未恢复以前的条件，但结构性变化——例如土地所有权的集中和封建占有形式的部分解散——其解释不在于生产方式本身的特定动态，而是与争夺统治权力的竞争有关。 作为说明这种情况的一个例子，我们可以提到，在1340年代开始在欧洲大部分地区致命蔓延的瘟疫流行期间，英格兰的农民由于租户的缺乏而能够缓解他们的义务，许多人甚至设法获得了自由。特别是在那些所有者只能对农民施加他们对生产前提条件的垄断权力的庄园中这种情况尤为如此，而对于那些拥有武力手段防范其统治由于劳动力‘市场’而被削弱的领主来说，情况却远非如此。这样，虽然一方面废除了领主权，但实力强大的修道院庄园能够通过增加对服务和税负的需求来弥补工人数量减少所造成的损失。他们最终也屈服于黑死病的影响——但这是在四十年后。 封建社会的结构动态最重要的是可以从争夺权力占有的竞争来解释，以及由此对‘剩余’产品的范围和占有形式的社会斗争前提条件的影响。争夺权力占有的竞争随时间推移以双重方式增加了执行权力的成本，提高了统治手段和人员的成本。这些成本以金钱表示，例如日益沉重的骑士装备费用，以及从15世纪开始购买大炮和改善要塞的成本。日益专业化的步兵不仅减少了骑士战斗的军事重要性，它还标志着封建战争形式的终结。它同样意味着，从那时起，战争需要一个可能通过战术联盟（如汉萨同盟）暂时建立的财政基础，但从长期来看，只有对于一个建立的王公统治才是可能的。 统治人员成本的增加首先来源于军事竞争，即雇佣雇佣兵的要求，这既源于附庸义务的解散，也源于战争结构的改变。与此同时，规则执行要求越来越多的专门法律知识。这有三个原因。首先，对领主之间无武装（即主要是法律上的）冲突及签订所有伴随统治能力集中而出现的财政协议很有用的是法律培训有素的专家；其次，领主利用其统治实践的形式化来占有，借助他们的人员，对地方统治习俗的定义能力（形式化，即规则的书面固定，使得能够针对农民对权利和正义的解释部署统治知识）；第三，这是一种成功的社会进步策略。在无需使用武器（尽管必要时仍会诉诸武力）的统治实践方面的专家不仅对于再现显赫宗族的地位日益不可或缺，他们也使自己变得不可或缺。专家的普遍社会实践（今天我们会将其描述为专业化策略）促进了封建统治的客观化。它也奠定了维持和奖励的要求。 执行统治成本的增加对领主产生了不同程度的影响。那些几乎负担不起装备自己的儿子成为骑士的人没有机会利用现在所需的人员。这也减少了他们再现自己作为领主地位的机会。然而，同时，无论是单个家庭还是整个社会群体，如法律学者（其中许多但不再全部是根据普遍的法律制度的神职人员），以及富裕的市民，都不断争取社会进步。他们的行动模式激发了防御策略：贵族出生的概念，以及在普遍规则中对贵族特权的确认。作为一个阶层的贵族的构成不仅结束了贵族宗族暂时扩展成为战士贵族的时代，也结束了使用‘封建主义’一词（虽不尽如人意，但在学术上已确立）作为分析意义上的时代。"},{"instruction":"请将“2. Ancien régime The concept of 'ancien régime' was coined by activists and champions of the French Revolution to describe what they wanted to abolish. The fact that this pejorative political slogan gained far wider currency than the English term 'Old Corruption' which was used slightly later expresses very well the dif-ference between the two political struggles. The concept of 'Old Corruption' described abuses, while that of 'ancien régime' condemned the foundations of the social and political order. In the 1790s, the term 'ancien régime' also served as political explanation of the causes of war: 'the Revolution' was opposed by the 'old forces' of Europe. The term ‘ancien régime' was first used in a scholarly sense by Alexis de Tocqueville in 1856. Tocqueville studied the old order as a crisis-prone functional context, from which he explained both the preconditions for the Revolution as well as important structural elements of the post-Revolutionary society. Why Tocqueville's analysis has remained decisive for subsequent scholarly use of the concept, however, is that it contained the idea of the destruction of feudalism and served in general to characterise a development understood as decline. This last aspect is particularly clear in Arno Mayer's thesis that the First World War was unleashed by representatives of the ancien régime, and that only in the course of the war did this social order finally succumb. For Mayer, the structure of society was determined by the continuing importance of agriculture, and the political influence of men who bore a noble name.8 Although a number of works have appeared in recent years in which the term ‘ancien régime' is not restricted to describing a form of government,9 the narrower concept was dominant in research for a long time. This may reinforce the reservations Marxists may have against my proposal to use the term ‘ancien régime' to denote a historical epoch. It is not the term on which I insist, however, rather that the introduction of a structural type, with a con-ceptual content to be subsequently explained, corresponds to the demands of a historical-materialist analysis, which - once freed from structuralist and economistic traditions of interpretation - uses the possibilities opened up by a theoretical concept oriented to an analysis of the entire context of a society, its reproduction and its change through social practice. If the conditions for generalised social practice fundamentally alter, accounting for this requires analysis of the particular historical forms and their structural connection - even if this means abandoning concepts that are not only hallowed by custom, but have had to be defended in many forceful struggles against scholarly and political opponents. The structures of the ancien régime took shape in a historical phase that in scholarly literature is described either as the ‘autumn of the Middle Ages' (Huisenga) or as the ‘spring of modern times' (Näf). As for the period in which the forms of rule of the ‘ancien-régime' type prevailed, the literature offers such varying descriptions as the ‘early modern era', ‘feudalism' and 'absolutism'. All these definitions are excluded by conceiving the ‘ancien régime' as an epoch. On the other hand, the 'age of Reformation' and the 'modern age', both thematising the change in spatial and temporal horizon, can be integrated into the analytic conception proposed here. Refoundation of personal rule Under the ancien régime, the foundations of personal rule - both those of generalised power and those of seigneurial power - were different from under feudalism. Feudal rule was based on direct relations of force, whereas rule under the ancien-régime structural type stood in a context of objectified social relations: a generalised system of justice and the market were both structural preconditions for the practice of rule. This structural change did not abolish the personal character of rule. Monarchical power did not lose its personal character by the generalisation of royal fiscal and judicial power, any more than seigneurial power lost its personal character by the transformation of labour rent into money rent. There is no justification for speaking of the state finding 'a new sense of life' in the fourteenth and fifteenth century,10 any more than of the socially neutral instance that Kierman claims to have taken shape between 1550 and 1650.11 Neither did the writings of William of Ockham have any direct effect on the subjects of the state, as Josef Engels claims,12 ascribing philosophical writings a direct relevance on religious practice. If kings appointed officials and decreed laws for their kingdom, this did not constitute a 'modern state' or even its early form. Monarchical power remained in the hands of an individual, and royal rulership still retained its sacral character under the ancien régime. In Otto Brunner's enlightening hypothesis, European kings were only prevented from extending their sacral power into a religiously based despotism by the fact that the popes could rely on the support of local powers - in other words, those taking shape as estates - in their struggle against such developments.13 The structure of rule of the ancien régime arose with the integration of aris-tocratic rule into generalised power: the constitution of a noble estate. By this process, the previous possession of rule by the aristocracy (or a nobility already constituted locally as an estate) was restricted, but, at the same time, guaranteed by generalised rule. Noble power became a privilege in relation to generalised princely power. In this way, seigneurial appropriation changed its character. Because this was tied into generalised and more or less codified legal structures (or, in some cases, explicitly excluded from these), it developed into a rule that existed in connection with generalised princely power. For this reason, too, the fact that in many regions of France in the second half of the eighteenth century a large part of the income of landowners was still derived from seigneurial appropriation is no argument for the persistence of 'feudalism'. Contemporaries may well have used the concept of feudalism for political purposes. But, in the development of societies of the ancien-régime type, what was initially at best a postulate gradually became reality: the particular power competences of private individuals became a rule de facto dependent on the crown, as their existence depended on the power of the latter. At the same time, the character of generalised power underwent a change. Though this still belonged to the king, generalised power now had its foun-dation in noble privilege. While the practice of generalised rule had previously demanded the establishment and maintenance of personal connections, it now required - in addition (!) - respect for the generalised conditions of reproduction of noble rule. Depending on the specific structure of power distribution, this change had the effect that the earlier duty of vassals to stand by the king with advice and aid was transformed either into the demand for representation, or the demand for particular negotiations with the possessors of privileges. Under feudalism, too, the duty of advice corresponded to a de facto claim to participation. For without the support of his barons, no medieval king would have been able to wage war, or even rule at all. This basic structure of reciprocal dependence remained in existence under the ancien régime, but its character changed to the extent that wars were increasingly dependent on the crown's generalised fiscal power, and the exercise of its rule likewise depended on generalised sanctioning and judicial power. The constitution of estate interests took place in the context of a generali-sation of monarchical power. Different strata of nobility and burghers pursued the securing of their privileges with mutually competing goals. But they determined their estate demands in relation to the crown. The latter thus developed into a status-regulating instance, if to a very varying degree in different 'national' spaces. Ennoblement by letters patent is an expression of this competence. Market and power Research findings in recent decades have made clear that the fiscalisation of the practice of personal rule in the age of feudalism was further advanced at all levels than previously supposed, also that the relevance of market structures in the age of the ancien régime was previously overestimated. Everywhere that small peasant modes of existence persisted, the integration of peasant families into the market was limited to the degree imposed by power. Even lords by no means followed consistent patterns of market rationality in their practice of rule. The spread of market structures was driven not by any autonomous dynamic of 'economic' development, but rather by struggles over the extent and forms of personal rule. The fiscalisation of ruling practice was the most important precondition for the development of trade, though this does not mean that the supply of goods did not conversely promote desires for fiscalisation. The increase in fiscalisation had two causes. On the side of the lords, the exercise of rule, even if confined to the defence of power already acquired, demanded resources that increasingly could be obtained only for money, while on the side of those dependent on them, fiscalisation promised a broader room for manoeuvre and greater personal freedom. (This assertion applies without reservation to the fiscalisation of the vassal obligations of lords. Peasants did not in all circumstances see fiscalisation as an improvement in their conditions. It was sometimes even forced on them.)”翻译为中文","output":"2. 旧制度 “旧制度”这一概念是由法国大革命的活动家和倡导者创造的，用来描述他们想要废除的东西。这个带有贬义的政治口号比稍后使用的英文术语“旧腐败”获得了更广泛的流传，这非常好地表达了两场政治斗争之间的差异。“旧腐败”的概念描述了滥用，而“旧制度”的概念则谴责了社会和政治秩序的基础。在1790年代，“旧制度”一词还被用作解释战争原因的政治解释：“革命”受到了欧洲“旧势力”的反对。 阿历克西·德·托克维尔于1856年首次以学术意义使用了“旧制度”一词。托克维尔研究了旧秩序作为一个危机倾向的功能背景，由此解释了革命的前提条件以及革命后社会的重要结构元素。然而，托克维尔的分析对后续学术界使用这一概念产生决定性影响的原因是，它包含了毁灭封建主义的观点，并总体上用于描述被理解为衰落的发展。这一观点在阿诺·梅耶的论断中表现得尤为明显，他认为第一次世界大战是由旧制度的代表人物引发的，且只有在战争过程中，这种社会秩序才最终崩溃。对梅耶来说，社会结构是由农业的持续重要性和贵族身份的政治影响力决定的。 虽然近年来出现了许多作品，其中“旧制度”一词不仅限于描述一种政府形式，但较窄的概念在研究中长期占主导地位。这可能增强了马克思主义者可能对我提出的使用“旧制度”来表示历史时期的建议的保留意见。然而，我坚持的不是这个术语，而是引入一个结构类型并随后解释其概念内容，这符合历史唯物主义分析的要求，该分析一旦摆脱了结构主义和经济主义的传统解释——利用了一个旨在分析整个社会背景、其再生产及通过社会实践的变革的理论概念所开启的可能性。如果广泛的社会实践条件根本改变了，解释这一点就需要分析特定的历史形式及其结构联系——即使这意味着放弃那些不仅被习俗所神圣化，而且在许多激烈斗争中不得不针对学术和政治对手予以捍卫的概念。 旧制度的结构在学术文献中被描述为“中世纪的秋天”（胡辛加）或“现代初期的春天”（纳夫）。就“旧制度”类型的统治形式盛行的时期而言，文献提供了不同的描述，如“早期现代时代”、“封建主义”和“绝对主义”。将“旧制度”视为一个时代则排除了所有这些定义。另一方面，“宗教改革时代”和“现代时代”，两者均主题化了空间和时间视野的变化，可以被整合进这里提出的分析概念中。 个人统治的重新奠基 在旧制度下，个人统治的基础——无论是普遍权力还是领主权力的基础——与在封建主义下的基础不同。封建统治基于直接的力量关系，而旧制度结构类型下的统治位于客观化的社会关系背景中：普遍的司法体系和市场都是统治实践的结构前提。这种结构变化并没有消除统治的个人特性。君主权力通过普遍的皇家财政和司法权力的普遍化并未失去其个人性，领主权力通过劳动租金转变为货币租金也并未失去其个人性。 在十四世纪和十五世纪谈论国家找到了“新的生命感”就像谈论基尔曼所声称的在1550到1650年间形成的社会中性实体一样没有根据。（基尔曼声称在这个时期形成了一个社会中性实体。）威廉·奥卡姆的著作也没有直接影响到约瑟夫·恩格尔斯所称的国家的臣民，将哲学著作直接相关于宗教实践。如果国王任命官员并为其王国颁布法律，这并不构成“现代国家”甚至其早期形式。在旧制度下，君主权力仍然掌握在个人手中，皇家统治在旧制度下仍保留了其神圣性质。根据奥托·布伦纳的启示性假设，欧洲的国王之所以未能将他们的神圣权力扩展到基于宗教的专制主义，是因为教皇可以依靠地方势力的支持——换句话说，那些作为阶层形成的力量——在他们反对这种发展的斗争中。 旧制度的统治结构随着贵族统治融入普遍权力而产生：贵族阶层的构成。通过这一过程，贵族（或作为地方阶层已经构成的贵族）对统治的先前占有受到限制，但同时又得到了普遍统治的保障。贵族权力相对于普遍的亲王权力成为了一种特权。 通过这种方式，领主占有的性质发生了变化。由于这种占有与普遍化且或多或少得到法律结构的规范化（或在某些情况下，明确排除在这些结构之外）联系在一起，它发展成为与普遍亲王权力相关的统治形式。也因此，在18世纪下半叶法国许多地区的地主收入仍然来自领主占有，并不是“封建主义”持续存在的论据。同时代人可能出于政治目的使用了封建主义的概念。但是，在旧制度类型社会的发展中，最初最多是一个假设逐渐变成了现实：私人个体的特定权力竞争变成了实际上依赖于王权的统治，因为它们的存在取决于后者的权力。 同时，普遍权力的性质也发生了变化。尽管这种权力仍归于国王所有，普遍权力现在建立在贵族特权之上。虽然普遍统治实践先前要求建立和维持个人联系，但现在它需要——除了(!)——尊重贵族统治再生产的普遍条件。根据特定的权力分配结构，这种变化导致了先前的附庸对国王提供建议和援助的义务转变为对代表权的要求，或对特权持有者的特定谈判的要求。 在封建主义下，提供建议的义务也对应于对参与的事实上的要求。因为没有他的男爵们的支持，中世纪的国王将无法发动战争，甚至根本无法统治。这种相互依赖的基本结构在旧制度下仍然存在，但其性质随着战争越来越依赖于王冠的普遍财政力量，以及其统治的执行同样依赖于普遍的制裁和司法权力而发生了变化。 阶层利益的构成发生在君主权力普遍化的背景下。不同阶层的贵族和市民追求以相互竞争的目标保障他们的特权。但他们根据王冠确定他们的阶层要求。因此，王冠逐渐发展成为一个状态调节实体，尽管在不同的“国家”空间中程度各异。通过专利信函册封是这种能力的表现。 市场与权力 近几十年的研究成果清楚地表明，封建时代个人统治实践的财政化在所有层面上比先前假设的更为先进，同时，旧制度时代市场结构的相关性先前被高估了。在小农模式的生存方式仍然存在的地方，农民家庭对市场的整合程度受到权力所强加的限制。即使是领主在其统治实践中也并非始终遵循市场理性的一致模式。 市场结构的扩展不是由‘经济’发展的自主动态推动的，而是由争夺个人统治的范围和形式的斗争推动的。统治实践的财政化是贸易发展的最重要前提，尽管这并不意味着商品供应没有反过来促进财政化的欲望。财政化的增加有两个原因。对领主而言，即使仅限于维护已获得的权力，统治的行使也需要资源，这些资源越来越多地只能通过金钱获得，而对于依赖他们的人而言，财政化承诺了更广阔的操作空间和更大的个人自由。（这一说法毫无保留地适用于对附庸义务的领主的财政化。农民并不总是将财政化视为改善他们条件的举措。有时甚至是被迫推行的。）"},{"instruction":"请将“The fiscalising of personal rule in no way had unambiguous consequences. For peasants, it meant better prospects of advance, but also the danger of getting into debt and losing the foundations of peasant existence. For lords, it offered the prospect of confirming their social status by wealth and thus strengthening their position, but also the danger of reducing the material foundations of their lordly existence by indebtedness. In the course of the ancien régime, though social status continued to be deter-mined by the forcible sanctioning of rule, this determination was increasingly supplemented by a separation - to a previously unknown degree - of the spheres of material life. One of the most important empirical structural features of societies of the ancien-régime type is their polarisation into rich and poor. In the eighteenth century, this polarisation seems to have been greater than ever before, and, in all probability, it was especially extreme in France - at least this is what both Alexis de Tocqueville14 and Olwen H. Hufton15 assume. Just as in all societies of the ancien régime, a hierarchy of intermediate strata and their respective practices of demarcation can be established, as can also successful strategies of social advance by both individuals and groups. In comparison with historically previous epochs, however, the great inequality of access to the goods of this world is particularly striking. This constituted an element of crisis in societies of the ancien régime. Though it was not wealth that determined status, social precedence - among members of an estate - and political influence increasingly demanded a practice of rule that presupposed wealth. Under the ancien régime, a new legitimisation practice was introduced. Rule was legitimised by itself, or more accurately, by its glamorous re-presentation. Josef Engel16 called this phenom-enon the ‘heroism of the beautiful appearance', while authors speak of Renais-sance princes when they want to refer to the splendour of rulers acquiring a previously unknown scale. The glamour that rule was now to present was served by art. This was all the more effective, once artists claimed superiority to the estate of artisans - in this way forming an interest group that crossed the borders of realms. Even if artists still worked to commission and for payment, art now distinguished itself from artisan products by a truth of its own. The practice of representation of rule lastingly marked the conditions of development of manufacture and trade. Never before or since was so much energy expended on the outward appearance of lords, on their buildings, equipment and promotion, according to Olwen H. Hufton in his analysis of the eighteenth century.17 In all the great cities of Europe, at least 13 per cent of the inhabitants were employed as servants - not all, but very many of them, in the houses of the rich.18 The attributes of personal rule already developed in the course of the ancien régime as preconditions for abstract wealth becoming a standard of value, and a standard which led to a considerable section of the nobility - both low and high - being unable to reproduce their lordly status. Certainly, for the whole duration of the ancien régime, source of family income remained decisive for social status, yet structures of reproduction of rule arising from the indispensability of outward display made the realisation of noble rank in practical social validity dependent on successful competition for wealth. When not all members of the nobility could manage this (in conditions that differed nationally to a marked degree), the de facto competence of the crown to regulate social status diminished with it. From a systemic point of view, this means that class position began to determine status, if so far only to a very limited extent. Private participation in centralised appropriation So long as appropriation remained a structural element of rule, the expansion of ruling competences offered the prospect of expanded appropriation. Fun-damentally, this held also for generalised personal power. Since, however, this generalisation could be effected only in collaboration with the possessors of partial rule, the demands of the latter could either structurally restrict the actual organisation of centralised appropriation, or immensely expand it at the price of private participation. Even where regular centralised appropriation was comparatively limited and its temporary expansion required a separate basis and agreement, there was private participation in centralised appro-priation. This took a variety of forms: the regular acquisition or transmission of office competences with the right to demand fees and propose presents, income from farming the princely tax-raising power, profits from lending to the government, regular presents and pensions as well as the indirect material benefit that successful patronage offered, by nobles bestowing office income on their clients, and thus saving costs on their own practice of rule. In a number of different ways, Lawrence Stone,19 Perry Anderson,20 as well as Herbert Gintis and Samuel Bowles21 have undertaken not only to describe the fact of appropriation mediated by the crown, but also to explain it in struc-tural-analytical terms. From the fact of the nobility's advantageous partici-pation in the material results of centralised power (not exclusively, but to a considerable degree), both Stone and Anderson conclude - in otherwise quite different works - the existence of a crisis of the nobility and of ‘feudalism'. Even before discussing any of the many empirical objections that have been raised, this rests on a logical mistake (also familiar, in just the same way, in analyses of imperialism). Exploitation of a new or, at all events, especially favourable possibility of appropriation is no evidence for a general crisis of material reproduction. Bowles and Gintis are not especially concerned with the nobility, but seek to understand the epoch described here as the ancien régime as a structural type. The description they propose is ‘state commercialism', or a ‘state commercial social formation'. But, despite agreeing with their emphasis on the particular structural conditions of reproduction, I cannot follow them here. In the first place, the concept of the state - made into a structuralist category by Bowles and Gintis - cannot do justice to the particular conditions of personal rule, and, secondly, while commercialisation did indeed decisively determine the conditions of reproduction of lordly status, it abolished neither the structural importance of warfare nor that of the practice of personal power. Moreover, the objectification of rule and the significance of commodity production remained limited for the conditions of reproduction of the peasants under the ancien régime (even if regional differences and differences of property relations played an important role). Finally, this description ignores the fact that the extent of appropriation mediated by the crown was an important structural determinant on the development of manufacture and trade, and, to some degree, even on that of agricultural production. With new possibilities of investment and profit, participation in generalised princely power competed not only in the quest for profit, but also in the winning of status. The notion proposed by Bowles and Gintis, however, makes it possible to view centralised appropriation no longer just in the optic of a subvention of partial - 'feudal'-aristocratic - rule (as with Stone and Anderson), but as a structural element of a material overall context based above all on taxation. This brings to the centre of analysis the causes of crises in material reproduction that were specific to the ancien régime. Social totality Under feudalism, the overall context of a kingdom existed in the form of rela-tions of armed force and a widespread mentality. There were indeed gen-eralised competences of power, but realisation of these remained based in war and religion. Only in the event of extraordinarily far-reaching possession of generalised force was it possible for the practice of generalised rule already to constitute overall social-structural connections. (It is sometimes useful to indicate that market structures were not yet developed to the degree that they could have an effect beyond local social-structural contexts.) Only in the epoch of the ancien régime did society arise as a structural reality. The foundation and form of existence of societies of the ancien-régime structural type was the practice of generalised personal power. This had two preconditions. Besides the already explained integration of partial personal rule into structures of generalised power was a readiness (internationally asserted) to accept certain spheres of rule as at least temporarily given realities. This was even the case for a while vis-à-vis the non-Christian 'world'. In 1536, the emperor had to abandon his plan to march against the Turks. In Europe itself, a foreign policy of reciprocal recognition of the rights of sovereignty was introduced in the various peace treaties of the years from 1648 to 1661.22 This transition to a 'Europe of powers' (Engel) corresponded to a change in the military. Almost everywhere, princes sought to free themselves from dependence on internationally active entrepreneurs and artisans of war, and, instead of this, establish and provide for 'national' armed forces. The extent and forms that such strategies took were varied. But, in this context, the actual systematising of the practice of monarchical rule was pursued more clearly than in any other realm of policy. Warfare continued to be under the ancien régime a determining moment of the development of power, but in a basically changed form. The territorialisation and generalisation of princely rule had the effect of intensifying the practice of rule - even if very slowly and always to a far lesser degree than is traditionally assumed in the concept of absolutism. In the course of time, the lacunae of feudal rule were filled. This held good initially in a spatial sense. Under the ancien régime, the forest lost the character of a space free from power that it typically had in feudal conditions, as well as a synonym for dark and heathen forces.23 The forest now became the object of privileges. These still gigantic and fearsome spaces were now incorporated into the governing authority of personal rule - at least at the level of a claim. The intensification of rule becomes clear in relation to those individuals who lived on the territory in question. Beginning with the expansion of royal claims to rule over the subjects of royal vassals, and the reality - at first only fiscal - of a generalised relationship of subjecthood, princely power increas-ingly made itself felt in the flesh of its subjects. Michel Foucault has described this change as the transition from power to government.24”翻译为中文","output":"个人统治的财政化并没有带来明确的后果。对于农民而言，它意味着更好的前进前景，但也面临着债务累累和失去农民生活基础的危险。对于领主而言，它提供了通过财富确认社会地位从而加强自己位置的前景，但也存在着通过负债减少领主生活物质基础的危险。 在旧制度时期，尽管社会地位继续由统治的武力制裁决定，但这种决定越来越多地被生活物质领域的前所未有的分离所补充。旧制度类型社会最重要的经验结构特征之一是其贫富两极分化。 在18世纪，这种两极分化似乎比以往任何时候都更大，很可能在法国尤为极端——至少这是阿历克西·德·托克维尔和奥尔温·H·休夫顿所假设的。就像在所有旧制度社会中一样，可以建立中间阶层等级及其各自的界限划定实践，也可以建立个人和团体的成功的社会上升战略。然而，与历史上的先前时期相比，通向世俗财物的巨大不平等尤其引人注目。这构成了旧制度社会危机的一个元素。 尽管并非财富决定地位，但社会优先权——在一个阶层的成员中——和政治影响力越来越多地要求一种假设财富存在的统治实践。在旧制度下，引入了一种新的合法化实践。统治通过其自身或更准确地说，通过其华丽的再呈现来获得合法化。约瑟夫·恩格尔称这一现象为“美丽外观的英雄主义”，而当作者们想要指代君主的辉煌达到前所未有的规模时，他们谈论文艺复兴时期的诸侯。 现在要展示的统治的光彩由艺术服务。一旦艺术家声称自身优于手工艺者阶层——从而形成跨越王国边界的利益团体，这就更加有效。即使艺术家仍然接受委托和付款工作，现在的艺术通过其自有的真理区别于手工艺品。 统治的呈现实践长久地标记了制造业和贸易发展的条件。据奥尔温·H·休夫顿在其对18世纪的分析中指出，以前或之后从未有过如此多的精力花费在领主的外表、建筑、装备和推广上。在欧洲所有大城市中，至少有13%的居民被雇用为仆人——不是所有，但很多人都在富人家中工作。 旧制度过程中已发展的个人统治属性作为抽象财富成为价值标准的先决条件，这一标准导致相当一部分贵族——无论高低——无法再生产他们的领主地位。当然，在旧制度的整个历史期间，家庭收入的来源对社会地位仍然具有决定性，但由于外在展示不可或缺的统治再生产结构，贵族地位在实际社会效力中的实现取决于财富竞争的成功。当并非所有贵族都能做到这一点时（在国家条件下有显著差异），王权调节社会地位的事实能力随之减弱。从系统的角度来看，这意味着阶层地位开始决定地位，尽管到目前为止只在非常有限的范围内。 私人参与中央集权的占有 只要占有仍然是统治的结构元素，统治能力的扩张就提供了占有扩张的前景。这原则上也适用于普遍化的个人权力。然而，由于这种普遍化只能与部分统治的拥有者合作才能实现，后者的要求可能在结构上限制中央集权的占有的实际组织，或以私人参与为代价极大地扩展之。即使在中央集权的占有相对有限，其临时扩展需要单独的基础和协议的地方，也存在私人参与中央集权的占有。这采取多种形式：定期获得或传递官职权力与要求费用和提议礼物的权利、从经营亲王税收权力中获得的收入、向政府借款的利润、定期的礼物和养老金以及成功赞助所提供的间接物质利益，通过贵族将官职收入赠予他们的客户，从而节省了自己统治实践的成本。 劳伦斯·斯通、佩里·安德森以及赫伯特·金蒂斯和塞缪尔·鲍尔斯等多位学者以不同的方式不仅描述了通过王权介导的占有这一事实，而且还试图用结构分析的术语来解释它。从贵族在中央集权的物质结果中有利参与的事实（不是专有的，但在相当程度上）出发，斯通和安德森在其截然不同的作品中得出贵族和“封建主义”危机的存在的结论。即使在讨论提出的许多经验反对意见之前，这也基于一个逻辑错误（在帝国主义的分析中以同样的方式也很熟悉）。开发新的或至少特别有利的占有可能性并不证明物质再生产的一般危机。鲍尔斯和金蒂斯并不特别关注贵族，而是试图将这里描述的时代理解为旧制度的结构类型。他们提出的描述是“国家商业主义”或“国家商业社会形态”。但是，尽管我同意他们强调特定再生产结构条件的重要性，我在这里无法跟随他们。首先，鲍尔斯和金蒂斯将国家概念变成结构主义范畴，无法做到公正对待个人统治的特定条件；其次，尽管商业化确实决定了领主地位再生产的条件，但它既没有废除战争的结构重要性，也没有废除个人权力实践的重要性。此外，统治的客观化和商品生产的重要性对农民在旧制度下的再生产条件仍然有限（即使地区差异和产权关系差异发挥着重要作用）。最后，这种描述忽略了通过王权介导的占有范围是对制造业和贸易发展的重要结构决定因素，某种程度上甚至对农业生产也是如此。随着新的投资和利润机会的出现，参与普遍化的亲王权力不仅在追求利润方面，而且在赢得地位方面展开竞争。然而，鲍尔斯和金蒂斯提出的概念使得可以不再仅仅将中央集权的占有视为对部分“封建”-贵族统治的补贴（如斯通和安德森所述），而是作为基于税收的物质整体背景的一个结构元素。这将特定于旧制度的物质再生产危机原因置于分析的中心。 社会整体 在封建主义下，一个王国的整体背景以武装力量关系和广泛心态的形式存在。确实存在普遍的权力职能，但这些职能的实现仍然基于战争和宗教。只有在普遍武力占有特别广泛的情况下，普遍规则实践才能构成整体社会结构联系。（有时候指出市场结构尚未发展到能对局部社会结构背景产生影响的程度是有用的。）只有在旧制度时代，社会才作为一个结构现实出现。 旧制度结构类型社会的基础和存在形式是普遍化的个人权力实践。这有两个前提条件。除了已经解释的部分个人统治融入普遍权力结构外，还需要一种准备性（在国际上得到认可），至少临时接受某些统治领域作为既定现实。即使对于非基督教的“世界”，一时间也是如此。1536年，皇帝不得不放弃进攻土耳其的计划。在欧洲本身，1648年到1661年的各种和平条约中引入了相互认可主权权利的外交政策。这种向“欧洲列强”（恩格尔）的过渡对应了军事的变革。几乎在所有地方，亲王都试图摆脱对国际活跃的战争企业家和艺人的依赖，而是建立和提供“国家”武装力量。这类策略采取的范围和形式是多样的。但在这个背景下，君王统治实践的实际系统化比在任何其他政策领域都被更清晰地追求。战争在旧制度下继续是权力发展的决定性时刻，但形式基本改变了。 亲王权力的领土化和普遍化加剧了统治实践——尽管非常缓慢且远低于传统上在绝对主义概念中假定的程度。随着时间的推移，封建统治的空白被填补。 这一点最初在空间意义上是成立的。在旧制度下，森林失去了它在封建条件下典型的免受权力影响的空间特性，以及作为黑暗和异教力量的同义词。森林现在成为特权的对象。这些仍然巨大且令人畏惧的空间现在被纳入个人统治的管辖权中——至少在声称的层面上是这样。 统治的加强在与居住在该领土上的个体有关的方面变得清晰。从对皇家附庸的臣民扩展皇家统治权的要求开始，以及臣民关系普遍化的财政现实，亲王权力日益在其臣民的肉体上显现。米歇尔·福柯将这一变化描述为从权力到治理的转变。"},{"instruction":"请将“This change in the practice of rule is especially evident in the social tech-nique of military drill, an invention of the ancien régime. In the deployment of drilled regiments, the meticulous power over bodies previously practised in case of emergency was replaced for the first time by a systematic practice of government of bodies. Of greater structural importance was the claim to command the religious practice of subjects. This was not something new under the ancien régime, but, after the Reformation, it came to differ from any previous form of princely involvement in religious power. For the Reformation transformed the relationship between secular territorial rule and religious power into the relationship of governments to a particular confession. Since, in societies of the ancien régime, the morality sanctioned by the church remained the most important form of social regulation, governments after the Reformation were compelled to prescribe and sanction a confessionally determined definition of the contents of good order. More than ever, the contents of good order were backed up by theological arguments, and calculations of power fought out in wars of religion, while conversely such wars brought about changes in the practices of rule. Crises of church rule and those of princely rule were recipro-cally connected. The condensing of personal rule into government provoked the develop-ment of two structural elements characteristic of societies of the ancien régime: the formalisation of everyday practices and the constitution of spheres free from power. In connection with the exercise of personal rule, the formalisation of every-day practices meant not so much that these were regulated by forms of general - formal - law, but, rather, that people faced one another as owners of various different - and very specific - rights. This can be most easily shown by par-ticular examples. Thus the regulation of artisan production by guilds meant regulation of the rights of masters and journeymen. Whether apprentices had to open the shop for the journeymen in the morning, whether the latter could expect food of a particular quality at definite times, whether off-cuts of material were given to the workers - all such matters were not just a question of private labour relations, but rather of a 'public' organisation. This defined and sanctioned by power the rights of individuals over the production process. Peasant production, too, was not simply the exercise of private disposal, even for peasants who owned their own land, it was, rather, a practice of rights that were regulated by other rights. Under the ancien régime, the family was integrated into this structure. Even the rule of the head of the household over his wife and children for a long time did not have a private character. It was, rather - until those changes that will be discussed below - just like the rule of landlords or that of guild masters, a partial rule whose existence and exercise was integrated into generalised rule, being both limited and sanctioned by this. The formalisation of practices of everyday life was the form in which the practice of generalised rule was condensed into government. It was not social relations that this regulated, but rather legally determined public forms of existence. To the extent that government institutionalised at least the claim to be a regulating instance for specific practices of life, a situation arose in which people no longer found themselves simply impelled to demand a further spe-cific right, but - on the contrary - to define a completely new kind of right: the right to a sphere free from power. The integration of earlier immunities into generalised rule was a historical precondition for the rise of a notion of private liberties. (It becomes clear once again here that bourgeois societies did precisely not develop out of feudal ones.) The first claim to a sphere free from power - and the most important one for the whole duration of the ancien régime - was provoked by the regulation of religious practice by power. The religious freedom that was demanded could mean two distinct things: the freedom to practise a belief that did not correspond to that prescribed by power, or the freedom to remove individual religious practice from public forms of religiosity that were experienced as empty. It was not just in Protestantism, but also in post-Reformation Catholicism, that pious individuals insisted on their rights within their own church. For, as against the situation under feudalism, the notion of piety caused people under the ancien régime no longer to withdraw from the world, but rather to formulate a claim to a sphere free from power. This had its social location in the family. In household prayer and mutual moral-religious discipline, such as was particularly characteristic of Puritan and pietist families, though not exclusively so, the claim to determine one's own belief was given practical expression. The privatising of the family, however, one of the concrete results of the power-free space, had its foundation not only in religion. A still greater change occurred in the regulation of ‘marriage'. All the complex problems around possession and inheritance remained. But, while the confrontation between man and woman had been previously located in the sacral realm, being therefore integrated, as Arlette Farge and Michel Foucault25 emphasise, into the sphere of royal regulatory competence, the problematic to be regulated shifted in a certain sense with the historical fabrication of the ‘sexual being' (H. Kentler). This social progress - Volkmar Sigusch describes it as the food question being supplemented by the social and sexual question,26 and stresses that this last only became possible once the old struggle for bare existence had been basically won - was accomplished in European society of the eighteenth century in a specific form. The demand for freedom contained in the discovery of the ‘sexual being' opposed the legitimacy of generalised regulation and precisely in this way constituted a sphere to be regulated. Over the course of the ancien régime, the family, much as it remained the organisational form for strategies of appropriation and advance, developed at the same time into the dominant social form of the administrative system. The married couple's bed-room was promoted in this way into the spatial centre of ‘private life'. Though the practice of piety could also extend to families in which the head of the household organised production, the constitution of the family as an admin-istering instance for sexuality was socially restricted. It could not develop where the material conditions of life made privacy impossible, nor, on the other hand, under modes of existence that were accomplished in the public forms of ceremonial. Just as the demand for a space of piety and sexuality that was free from power was a structural feature of the ancien régime, so too was the demand to conceive good order in non-theological terms. The Enlightenment was, as William Doyle expressed it,27 a ‘phenomenon of the ancien régime'. Its forms of expression criticised the scope of the regulatory claim of personal rule, but not its actual existence. The Enlightenment, like Puritanism before it, became a revolutionary force only in connection with struggles that it had not itself set in motion. Otherwise than is often assumed, I do not see the power-free space as hav-ing particular structural importance in societies of the ancien régime, neither for economic decisions nor for the historical origin of the private sphere. This certainly did arise, but the dominant thing was not the demand to abolish the regulation of appropriation by power, but much rather demands bearing on regulation. Not the abolition of privileges, but access to them, was the structurally typical form in which former non-privileged families and social groups sought to realise their ascent in societies of the ancien régime. Privileges and interests The integration of partial rule into structures of generalised power had the result that crises of the ancien régime differed from crises of feudal societies. The ancien-régime form of rule, however, did not come into structural crisis simply because individual families or even a large number of these lost their partial (seigneurial) power, but only when the reproduction of generalised personal power was endangered. A danger of this kind could arise from the crisis-prone reproduction of seigneurial appropriation, but it did not necessarily have to. The persistence of the ancien-régime rule structure was certainly bound up with the ability of generalised personal power to integrate partial rule and manage it in the form of privilege, but it was not tied to the content of any specific privileges. There were two main causes of the reproduction crises of generalised rule, one following chronologically on the other. In the early phases, the most important possibility of crisis lay in the frondiste resistance of nobles to the generalised power. This differed in strength between the various realms, and was generally reduced by the high nobility being brought to court. To the extent that this presupposed the strengthened participation of the high nobility in the material results of monarchical rule, the potentiality of a noble fronde was transformed into the potentiality of a financial crisis of monarchical rule. We can maintain by way of generalisation that the earlier danger of frondisme was reduced to the possibility of political conflict, once the right of resistance that the nobility still claimed at the start of the ancien régime was in practice undermined by the structural change in armed force.28 From now on, though the existence of particular dynasties might be endangered, and the ruling practice of particular monarchs sometimes faced major difficulties, the insti-tution of a generalised monarchical power could no longer be endangered by revolts of the nobility. The persistence of the ancien régime, however - i.e. the context of objectified personal rule -, was endangered once this generalised power was no longer in a position to guarantee privileges. Olwen H. Hufton, who titled his analysis of the eighteenth century Privilege and Protest, rightly stresses that, under the ancien régime, it was not just the nobility who enjoyed privileges, but also the inhabitants of particular prov-inces and towns, not to mention the privileges of the local poor vis-à-vis for-eign beggars, or the privilege of suffrage that even men dwelling in wretched hovels possessed in certain English constituencies.29 Neither the hierarchical structure of privileges not the establishment of a general subject status should deceive us as to the fact that societies of the ancien régime were divided in two: the world of the privileged and that of the others. There were, of course, many gradations. But ruling power and cultural hegemony belonged to the aristoc-racy. (I use this concept deliberately, meaning not only the nobility whose status was legally fixed.) ”翻译为中文","output":"统治实践的这一变化在军事训练的社会技术上尤为明显，这是旧制度的发明。在部署训练有素的团队时，之前在紧急情况下对身体的细致控制首次被系统化的身体管治实践所取代。 具有更大结构重要性的是对统治主体宗教实践的指挥权要求。这在旧制度下并不是什么新鲜事，但在宗教改革之后，它与任何之前的亲王参与宗教权力的形式有所不同。因为宗教改革将世俗领土统治与宗教权力的关系转变为政府与特定宗派的关系。由于在旧制度社会中，教会认可的道德依然是社会调节的最重要形式，改革后的政府被迫规定并认可一种基于宗派的良序内容定义。良序的内容比以往更多地得到神学论证的支持，通过宗教战争进行权力计算，而反过来，这样的战争又引发了统治实践的变化。教会统治的危机和亲王统治的危机相互关联。 个人统治浓缩为政府行为引发了旧制度社会特有的两个结构元素的发展：日常实践的形式化和脱离权力的领域的构成。 与个人统治的行使相联系，日常实践的形式化并不是说这些实践受到普遍-形式化-法律形式的调节，而是说人们面对彼此时拥有各种不同且非常具体的权利。这一点可以通过特定的例子最容易展示。因此，工会对工匠生产的规定意味着对师傅和学徒权利的规定。无论学徒是否必须在早晨为学徒开店，后者是否可以期待在特定时间获得特定质量的食物，是否将材料的切割下脚料给工人——所有这些问题不仅仅是私人劳动关系的问题，而是一种“公共”组织问题。这通过权力定义并认可个人对生产过程的权利。农民生产也不仅仅是私人支配行为，即使对于拥有自己土地的农民来说，它更是一种受其他权利调节的权利实践。在旧制度下，家庭被整合进这一结构。即使在将会讨论到的那些变化之前，家庭户主对其妻子和孩子的统治长时间并未具有私人性质。与领主统治或行会师傅的统治一样，它是一种部分统治，其存在和行使被融入到普遍统治中，受此限制并得到认可。日常生活实践的形式化是将普遍统治实践浓缩为政府的形式。这不是调节社会关系，而是调节法律规定的公共存在形式。 随着政府至少宣称是对生活特定实践的调节实体，出现了一种情况，即人们不再简单地要求获得进一步的特定权利，而是相反地定义一种全新类型的权利：脱离权力的领域权利。将早期的豁免权融入到普遍统治中是私人自由观念产生的历史前提。（这再次清楚地表明，资产阶级社会并非直接从封建社会发展而来。）对脱离权力领域的首次要求——对整个旧制度时期都至关重要——是由权力对宗教实践的规定所激发的。所要求的宗教自由可以意味着两种不同的事物：实践与权力规定不符的信仰的自由，或将个人宗教实践从被视为空洞的公共宗教形式中移除的自由。不仅在新教中，也在宗教改革后的天主教中，虔诚的个人坚持在自己的教会内的权利。因为与封建主义下的情况相反，旧制度下的虔诚观念使人们不再从世界中撤退，而是提出脱离权力领域的要求。这在家庭中找到了其社会定位。在家庭祷告和相互的道德-宗教约束中，如普利坦和虔诚派家庭特有的，尽管不是唯一的，就给自决信仰的要求付诸实践。 然而，家庭的私有化，作为脱离权力空间的具体结果之一，并不仅仅基于宗教。在“婚姻”的规定中发生了更大的变化。围绕财产和继承的所有复杂问题仍然存在。但是，当男女之间的对抗以前位于圣域，因此被纳入皇家调节能力范畴时，如阿莱特·法尔奇和米歇尔·福柯所强调的，待调节问题在一定意义上随着“性别存在”的历史构造而转移。这一社会进步——沃尔克马·西古什将其描述为食物问题被社会性和性问题所补充，强调这最后一点只有在旧的生存斗争基本上获得胜利后才成为可能——在18世纪的欧洲社会以特定形式实现。对于在“性别存在”的发现中蕴含的自由的要求，反对普遍规制的合法性，并以这种方式构成了一个待规制领域。随着旧制度的演变，家庭，虽然它仍然是获取和上升战略的组织形式，同时发展成为行政系统的主导社会形式。这样，已婚夫妇的卧室被提升为“私人生活”的空间中心。尽管虔诚实践也可能扩展到家庭户主组织生产的家庭，但家庭作为管理性行为范畴的构成在社会上是有限的。在生活物质条件使隐私不可能的情况下，或者在公共礼仪形式下完成的生活模式下，它无法发展。 正如对宗教和性领域脱离权力的要求是旧制度的结构特征，对以非神学术语构思良序的要求也是如此。正如威廉·多伊尔所表达的，“启蒙运动是旧制度的现象”。其表达形式批评了个人统治的调节要求的范围，但并未质疑其实际存在。启蒙运动像之前的清教徒主义一样，只有在与它本身未引发的斗争联系中才成为革命力量。 与通常假设的不同，我认为在旧制度社会中，脱离权力的空间对于经济决策或私人领域的历史起源并没有特殊的结构重要性。这确实产生了，但主导的不是要求废除权力对占有的调节，而更多的是与调节有关的要求。不是废除特权，而是获得特权，是过去非特权家庭和社会群体在旧制度社会中寻求实现上升的典型结构形式。 特权和利益 部分统治融入普遍权力结构的结果是，旧制度的危机与封建社会的危机不同。然而，旧制度的统治形式并非仅因为个别家庭或大量这样的家庭失去了它们的部分（领主）权力而陷入结构性危机，而只有当普遍化的个人权力的再生产受到威胁时才会出现这种危机。这种威胁可能源于领主占有的危机倾向再生产，但并非必然如此。旧制度统治结构的持续性确实与普遍化的个人权力整合并以特权形式管理部分统治的能力相关，但它不依赖于任何特定特权的内容。 普遍统治的再生产危机有两个主要原因，一个接着一个。在早期阶段，最重要的危机可能性在于贵族对普遍权力的抵抗。这在不同领域的强度有所不同，通常通过将高级贵族带入宫廷而减弱。由于这需要高级贵族在君主统治的物质结果中加强参与，贵族反叛的可能性转变为君主统治的财政危机的可能性。我们可以概括地说，一旦旧制度开始时贵族仍然声称的抗拒权在实践中被武装力量结构变化所破坏，早期的贵族反叛危险就减少到政治冲突的可能性。从那时起，尽管特定王朝的存在可能受到威胁，特定君主的统治实践有时面临重大困难，但贵族叛乱不再能危及普遍君主权力的制度。然而，旧制度的持续——即客观化个人统治的背景——一旦这种普遍权力不再能够保障特权，就会受到威胁。 奥尔温·H·休夫顿在其对18世纪分析的标题《特权与抗议》中正确强调，在旧制度下，不仅是贵族享有特权，特定省份和城镇的居民也享有特权，更不用说当地穷人相对于外来乞丐的特权，或者某些英国选区破败小屋中居住的男性拥有的选举权特权。特权的层级结构和普遍性身份地位的建立不应使我们误认为旧制度社会被二分为特权者世界和其他人。当然有许多层次。但统治权力和文化霸权属于贵族。（我有意使用这个概念，不仅指身份法律上固定的贵族。）"},{"instruction":"请将“Throughout the ancien régime, some individuals and entire corporations had to abandon earlier privileges, whilst others managed to acquire new privileges. Privileges were inherited, appropriated de facto, or purchased. This was also, in a certain sense, private participation in centralised power. Just as centralised power had to be realised in practice, so privileges did not so much provide a ruling position or a guarantee of appropriation, so much as the possibility of realising rule and appropriation in the most favourable conditions. With trading and guild privileges, this character is quite evident. But even the favourable tax situation of the nobility, for example, could not guarantee a leading material position, but only favour them in a particular fashion. The more that the social requirement asserted itself, in the course of development of the ancien régime, to the effect that social position as defined by estate membership had to obtain social validity by the specific practice of rule, the clearer did the fortuitous character of privileges become. Their effect was increasingly subject to the conditions of competition for wealth and esteem - though in no way exclusively so. This development was further accelerated by the fact that privileges themselves were an article of trade. Office power, tax advantages and noble titles could be acquired for money, just as could the seigneurial powers of appropriation and justice that still persisted. Access to the market for certain privileges, however, in particular the market for office power, remained socially restricted. The ruling estates successfully defended against the social validity of abstract wealth the social privileging of appro-priation from land, office and marriage. Access to landownership and office power, however, became easier in the course of the ancien régime: by the expansion of centralised office power and the dissolution of manors and seigneuries. The dissolution of seigneurial power brought about an expansion of the market for land - quite irrespective of whether it reinforced the property rights of existing landlords or of peasant claims. Both small proprietors and great landlords could find themselves forced by debt or the need for money to give up part of their land or their entire holding. This made possible a process of concentration, but also the access of formerly non-privileged families to the material preconditions for admission to the trade in privileges. As social status became tied to market structures, the chances of social advance rose for both families with estate privilege and those formerly non-privileged. Differences between estate position and material position led under the ancien régime to crises of generalised power. They also led to both rulers and advancing social strata being linked by common behavioural motivations. This new state of affairs was given expression by contemporaries in a new concept: the concept of interest. The present inflationary use of the term con-ceals the notion's historical character. In actual fact, there were structural preconditions for the conception of interest, which only developed under the ancien régime. (The term itself is older; in the Middle Ages it was already used in the still prevailing economic sense.) Before a concept of behavioural motivation could arise that was not specific to any estate, there first had to be a certain generalisation of living conditions. Since this arose from the linkage between social position sanctioned by power and market structures, an orientation to material goals soon established itself as its most important content. If people were seen as beings guided by interest, which was increasingly the case from the seventeenth century, human behaviour became calculable within certain limits. Until that time, no other guarantee of calculable behaviour could be conceived of than a common religious belief. The vehement persecution of those with a different belief was inspired not least because their neighbours and their lords saw them as unreliable. Albert O. Hirschman30 cites expressions that indicate how the invention of interest facilitated the move to religious tolerance. This connection presumably also existed the other way round, i.e. the indispensable experiences in common life with members of a different confession facilitated the rise of the conception of interest. For one's own behavioural motivation and that of others to be conceived of as interest presupposes that individuals perceive themselves as individuals, impelled to consider their individual circumstances as it were from outside and in a position to actually do so. The constitution of interest, behavioural motivations that people share with others and pursue against others, presupposes a certain capacity of abstraction. Interests are an interpretation of one's own circumstances in which certain concrete elements such as emotions or state of health remain out of the equation.31 If interests are understood only as a kind of individual reflex to social conditions, the category has no analytical use. Interests always arise in a relationship of agreement - or disagreement - with the dominant values. In other words, the use of the concept of interest in scholarly analysis is tied up with particular historical assumptions: actual generalisation of conditions of life, and discourses in which such generali-sation is thematised. Both things were the case under the ancien régime. The concept of interest and its contents developed in accordance with the actual structure of generalisation. The conception reflected the increasing involve-ment of social position in market structures, and the contents of interests were oriented above all to generalised power. The demand was made on this power either to facilitate material and social advance, or to alleviate the effect of the market. Discourse about interests arose above all as discourse about the (estate-based) practice of generalised rule. This early history of interest has two further structural features. Although the theoretical notion of interest applies to individuals, in practice interest is pursued en famille. This ascribed the family, in those social strata where the assertion of the notion of interest demanded a cultural revolution, the additional function of legitimising these behavioural motivations in relation to the behavioural ideal of honour. When the concept of interest appeared, it described - as Hirschman has shown32 - an opposition to untamed passion. A cool head and the notion of interest both made their appearance at the same historical moment. And at a time, moreover, when the feudal form of war had not only lost military effectiveness, but also its cultural hegemony. At first it was only necessary for princes to pursue legitimate and necessary interests - i.e. not to be driven by passion. The social triumph of the conception only followed the relativising of possession of privilege by the effect of market structures, in the context of the condensation of generalised rule. The second structural feature of the constitution of interests under the ancien régime was an orientation to rights. Since politics was not yet oriented to the regulation of social relations, but rather to ascribing rights to particular individuals or groups, the contents of interests also arose from this specific historical connection. In the course of the ancien régime, an additional content of the notion of inter-est developed. Once people ventured to think that history could be made, there arose a discourse, however socially limited, over interests whose commonality rose above the partiality of the interests of particular social groups. This also gave rise to a claim for rights: the natural rights of man. 3. Bourgeois state Bourgeois revolution as analytical category In recent decades, the concept of bourgeois revolution has acquired the func-tion of dividing the flock of historians into supporters and opponents of the Marxist interpretation of history. This has not been good for it. If I persist in using the concept here, it is to make clear what it should not express. (It is immaterial in the present connection whether the views to be excluded are actually represented by Marxists, or only very commonly attributed to them.) Above all else, this is the equation of ‘bourgeois revolutions' with the accom-plishment of a capitalist economic order, which, for Marxist interpretations, is constitutive of such revolutions. In the present study, however, I argue that capitalist forms of production and distribution could only become dominant after the personal character of power had been (largely) abolished, so that the development of a separate economic sphere became possible. Orthodox Marx-ism maintains the opposite: the change in the mode of production is supposed to burst asunder the previous forms of power. As a structural category, moreover, bourgeois revolution does not refer here to a particular form of historical change. Whether conflicts leading to a change in power culminated in open civil war and events that contemporaries already viewed as the start of a whole new epoch, or whether they led to successive rounds of reform until personal power was eventually eliminated, does not affect bourgeois revolution as a structural category. Finally, the concept also says nothing about the groups who waged the conflicts that led to personal power being regulated, limited and abolished. The central content of the con-cept is, rather, the thesis that the transition from ancien régime to bourgeois society demanded the expropriation of personal possession of power.”翻译为中文","output":"在整个旧制度时期，一些个人和整个公司不得不放弃以前的特权，而其他人则设法获得新的特权。特权被继承、事实上被占有或购买。从某种意义上讲，这也是私人参与中央集权的一部分。正如中央集权必须在实践中实现一样，特权不仅提供了统治地位或占有保证，更多的是在最有利条件下实现统治和占有的可能性。对于贸易和行会特权，这一特征非常明显。但即使是贵族的有利税务情况，例如，也不能保证领先的物质地位，但只能以特定方式给予优待。随着社会要求在旧制度的发展过程中日益强烈，即社会地位如何通过身份成员身份定义必须通过特定的统治实践获得社会有效性，特权的偶然性就变得越来越明显。他们的影响越来越多地受到财富和尊重竞争条件的制约——尽管不是唯一的。特权本身成为贸易商品这一事实进一步加速了这一发展。官职权力、税收优势和贵族头衔可以用金钱购买，就像仍然存在的领主占有和司法权力一样。然而，进入某些特权市场的途径，特别是官职权力市场，仍然在社会上受到限制。统治阶层成功地防御了对土地、官职和婚姻来源的占有的社会特权免受抽象财富社会效力的影响。 然而，在旧制度的进程中，获得土地所有权和官职权力变得更容易：通过扩大中央集权官职权力和解散庄园和领地。领主权力的解体导致土地市场的扩张——无论这是否强化了现有地主的财产权或农民的要求。小地主和大地主都可能因债务或资金需求而被迫放弃部分土地或全部土地。这使得集中过程成为可能，也使得以前非特权家庭获得加入特权交易的物质前提条件成为可能。随着社会地位与市场结构的联系，拥有身份特权的家庭和以前非特权的家庭的社会上升机会都增加了。在旧制度下，身份地位和物质地位之间的差异导致了普遍权力的危机。它们还导致统治者和社会上升阶层之间通过共同的行为动机联系在一起。 这种新情况由当代人用一个新概念来表达：利益概念。当前对这一术语的通货膨胀式使用掩盖了该概念的历史特征。事实上，利益概念的结构前提条件只有在旧制度下才发展出来。（该术语本身更早；在中世纪已经以仍占主导的经济意义使用。）在尚未具体到任何身份的行为动机概念出现之前，首先必须存在某种生活条件的普遍化。由于这种普遍化来自于权力认可的社会地位与市场结构的联系，因此很快建立了以物质目标为最重要内容的导向。如果人们被视为受利益驱动的存在，从17世纪起这种情况越来越普遍，人类行为在一定范围内变得可计算。在那之前，除了共同的宗教信仰之外，无法想象出其他保证行为可计算的方式。对异教徒的激烈迫害不仅仅因为邻居和他们的领主视他们为不可靠。阿尔伯特·O·赫希曼引用的表述表明，利益的发明如何促成了对宗教容忍的转变。这种联系推测也以相反的方式存在，即与不同宗派成员的共同生活中不可或缺的经验促进了利益观念的兴起。将自己和他人的行为动机视为利益的前提是，个体将自己视为个体，被迫从外部考虑自己的个人情况，并且实际上能够这样做。利益的构成，人们与他人共享并反对他人追求的行为动机，前提是一定程度的抽象能力。利益是对自身情况的一种解释，在这种解释中某些具体元素如情感或健康状况不在考虑之中。如果利益仅被理解为对社会条件的一种个体反射，这个范畴就没有分析用途。利益总是在与主导价值观的一致性或不一致性关系中产生。换句话说，利益概念在学术分析中的使用与特定的历史假设相关：生活条件的实际普遍化，以及这种普遍化被主题化的论述。在旧制度下，两者都是如此。利益概念及其内容根据普遍化的实际结构发展。这个概念反映了社会地位与市场结构日益交织在一起，而利益内容主要以普遍权力为导向。对这种权力的要求要么是为了促进物质和社会上升，要么是为了缓解市场的影响。关于利益的论述主要作为关于（基于身份的）普遍规则实践的论述出现。 利益的早期历史具有两个进一步的结构特征。尽管理论上的利益概念适用于个体，但实际上利益是以家庭为单位追求的。这为家庭赋予了额外的功能，在那些提出利益观念需要文化革命的社会阶层中，将这些行为动机相对于荣誉的行为理想合法化。当利益概念出现时，正如赫希曼所展示的，它描述了对未驯服激情的反对。冷静头脑和利益观念同时出现于同一个历史时刻。而且是在封建形式的战争不仅失去了军事效力，而且失去了其文化霸权的时候。起初，只有亲王追求合法和必要的利益——即不被激情驱动。社会上对利益概念的胜利只是在市场结构的影响下相对化了特权占有，在普遍规则凝聚的背景下随之而来。旧制度下利益构成的第二个结构特征是权利的取向。由于政治尚未以调节社会关系为导向，而是以将特定个人或团体的权利归属为导向，因此利益内容也源于这一特定的历史联系。 在旧制度的过程中，利益概念的附加内容得以发展。一旦人们开始认为历史可以被创造，就出现了一种论述，尽管社会上受到限制，但超越特定社会群体利益局限性的共同利益论述。这也引发了权利要求：人的自然权利。 3. 资产阶级国家 资产阶级革命作为分析范畴 近几十年来，资产阶级革命的概念已成为将历史学家们划分为马克思主义历史解释的支持者和反对者的功能。这对它并没有好处。如果我在这里坚持使用这个概念，是为了明确它不应表达什么。（在目前的语境中，要排除的观点是否实际上由马克思主义者代表，或仅被普遍地归咎于他们，这并不重要。） 最重要的是，这里不将“资产阶级革命”等同于资本主义经济秩序的完成，这对于马克思主义解释来说是构成此类革命的。然而，在本研究中，我辩称，资本主义的生产和分配形式只有在个人权力的特征（大体上）被废除之后才能成为主导，从而使得一个独立的经济领域的发展成为可能。正统的马克思主义持相反观点：认为生产方式的改变应当打破之前的权力形式。 此外，作为一个结构范畴，资产阶级革命在这里并不指向一种特定形式的历史变革。无论导致权力变革的冲突是否在公开的内战中达到高潮，并且被当代人视为一个全新时代的开始，还是导致个人权力被规范、限制并最终废除的连续改革过程，都不影响资产阶级革命作为一个结构范畴。最后，这个概念也没有说明哪些群体进行了导致个人权力受到规范、限制和废除的冲突。相反，这个概念的核心内容是，从旧制度过渡到资产阶级社会要求剥夺个人对权力的占有。"},{"instruction":"请将“If, despite all these qualifications I retain the analytical concept of ‘bourgeois revolution', the reason is simple: it offers the great advantage of rejecting all theoretical concepts that analyse the modern state as the result of gradual change: the outcome of increasing strength and rationalisation, accompanied by long-run processes of cultural transformation. As against this, I persist in the view that the emergence of a separate sphere of the 'state' only happened with the depersonalising of ruling power, and that such processes effected a world-historical breach in the development of forms and practices of power. This breach has been rightly described as a revolution. By characterising it as 'bourgeois', its specific world-historical preconditions are addressed. They mark the constitution and development of the first historical forms of modern state power. Naturally, these developments took different forms in each coun-try (the major theme of the present book), since concrete interests, demands and modes of behaviour are always marked by concrete relations of power and discourses, and yet we need not follow Reinhard Bendix,33 who sees only these special national roads. For in contrast with other processes of constitution of modern state power, for example in postcolonial societies or societies that were ruled by a supposedly socialist one-party system, the structural significance of the common historical preconditions of bourgeois state power is very clear. Structural preconditions for bourgeois revolution The preconditions for bourgeois revolution are crises of rule in societies of the ancien-régime structural type. The concrete causes of their eruption are not in question here. 'Revisionist' historians typically argue that these are always contingent: provoked by strategies that could have been quite different, accel-erated by harvest failures and/or military defeats. But such occasions play their part in conditions in which general features can be discerned, for all the differences between one instance of power and another. Central to these are the economic and social limits of the integrative ability of the system of rule of the ancien-régime type. For under the ancien régime, if in very varying degrees, social positions and forms of appropriation are, to a large extent, laid down in law, i.e. defined by power, and sanctioned with the means of generalised rule. This applies to immediate participation in the appropriation competences of the crown by way of office power, as well as to privileges that offer favourable prospects for commercial profit, to the limited admission to guilds and even to the perpetuation of apparently very ancient forms of landownership and juridical power. In these conditions, family strategies of social advance became competitive strategies for participation in generalised power. So long (and in so far) as material participation in generalised power could be limited, the strategies of new families and social groups meant a change in the com-petition between factions of nobles and clientele groups that was quite char-acteristic of ancien-régime societies. But a constant increase in these strategies of advance sharpens the competition for social positions sanctioned by power and for material benefit from generalised power. The possibilities of integra-tion are set by the limited productivity of an overwhelmingly agricultural society, as well as by steadily rising costs of armed appropriation. New offi-cials reduce the (material) importance of those already in place, new trading privileges curtail the prospects of profit of the older ones. If appropriation by way of generalised power cannot be expanded, this not only makes it harder to satisfy the competition between clientele groups, but also the possibilities of advance in the existing social hierarchies. The possession of legal rights was contested. Whether it was a question of the regulation of labour relations, farm leases or appropriation by way of office power and taxation, the possessors of different rights were always in mutual confrontation. Since generalised power sanctioned the differences in rights, all these relationships were integrated into the practice of generalised power. These rights varied greatly from one province to another, from town to town, if not from village to village and even from one landed estate to the next. Yet when it finally came to theoretical and practical criticism of the forms of rule of the ancien régime, the revolutionising of established conditions did not need to be waged separately against every local authority and corporation. For, by the end of the ancien régime, there existed between generalised princely and local rule not just a proclaimed connection but a very real one. Only to the extent that generalised rule was integrated could such various privileges as the right to keep pigeons, to attend sessions of the Upper House, to equip ships for the import of tea or spices, to inherit the office of judge or to march at the head of a festive procession have a general character; only thus were these something more than so many particular vexations, and could be condemned in the course of bourgeois revolutions with the slogans of 'feudalism' or 'Old Corruption'. It was not a question of unification, or even the assertion of the 'absolute' rule of a sovereign, but rather of the integration of many individual forms of rule into a connection of legally justified and commercialised ruling positions. In the course of the ancien régime, and especially clearly after 1648, this context of generalised rule took on territorial form. Indeed, bourgeois revolu-tions would not have been possible without the (more or less precise) territorial demarcation of realms. The demand to establish a republic related to a circumscribed sphere of ruling power, and still does so today. The structural possibility of bourgeois revolution led on to the concrete historical process of structural change, wherever and whenever public dis-courses developed that challenged the legitimacy of established rule and, in this way, formulated the claim of ‘the people' to decide on this legitimacy from now on, and thus to become the subject of politics. It is the contents and forms of these public spheres, whether those of a literary public, of organised or spontaneous forms of verbal communication, by which the revolutionary transformation of power acquires its ‘bourgeois' character. This content, too, was the outcome of the history of ancien-régime societies, and generally arose in direct polemic with established discourses and forms of rule. Natural rights, the Enlightenment, criticism of the church and processes of individualisation, were as much results of the earlier form of rule as the demands for commercial freedom, the abolition of monopolies and the expropriation of personal rule. The conditions under which such criticism developed varied from one country to another, and the forms in which it triumphed did so likewise. Yet there are common structural features to this revolutionary process. To pick out just one of these here: a precondition for the revolutionising of the ancien régime into bourgeois society was a specific change in the conception of interests. Whereas - as already discussed above (Part Five, 2) - interests under the ancien régime were tied to corporate and especially family structures (more exactly, to the household and its head), the critique of the system of privileges meant that in future individuals had to be considered as the bearers of interests. Even if origin, family ties and even familial reproduction strategies continued to remain relevant, the behavioural principle of interest lost its corporate and family character in the process of bourgeois revolution. The public spheres that made themselves into a legitimising instance of politics were composed of individuals, even if relatives, friends and neighbours might be active in them together. In the practice of a public critique of the ancien régime, people experienced themselves as individuals, in so far as they demanded the life-form of public freedom together with others. Only this social practice made the structural possibility of bourgeois revolution into a historical reality. In the process of this revolution, no matter whether it was compressed in time or took many years to complete, individuality arose as a mode of public existence. This led to the generalisation of those cultural forms that, according to Richard Sennett, developed for social intercourse among strangers,34 on the basis of the political public sphere. It is not - or not only - a question of a change in theoretical conceptions, but of new forms of social life. The results of bourgeois revolutions Just as ‘bourgeois revolutions' posited their goals out of a critique of the con-ditions of rule of the ancien régime, and did not become ‘bourgeois' simply because they were waged by that particular class, so the results of such revo-lutions were ‘bourgeois' above all in their difference from preceding forms and practices of generalised personal ruling power. All bourgeois revolutions involved comprehensive processes of expropria-tion. The owners and possessors of rulership rights, the princes at their head, were deprived of their former legitimate competences. Personal rule developed into public - impersonal - power. The sovereignty that had already been established both internally and externally became the sovereignty of the people. Bourgeois revolutions destroyed the dynastic basis of sovereignty, which the contracting parties of the Peace of Westphalia had still taken for granted. It was only then, and not already in 1648, that ‘the people' became the key point of reference for sovereignty. And thus it was also not in 1648, but only in the course of bourgeois revolutions, that the concept of state sovereignty arose that has since been the foundation of international law.35”翻译为中文","output":"尽管有所有这些限定，如果我保留“资产阶级革命”的分析概念，原因很简单：它提供了一个巨大的优势，拒绝了所有将现代国家视为渐进变化结果的理论概念：这一变化是实力和理性化不断增强伴随长期文化转型过程的结果。与此相对，我坚持认为，“国家”作为一个独立领域的出现仅在统治权力去个人化之后才发生，并且这样的过程在权力形式和实践发展的世界历史上产生了一次断裂。这一断裂被正确地描述为一场革命。通过将其定性为“资产阶级”，就解决了其特定的世界历史前提条件。这些前提标志着现代国家力量的第一种历史形态的构成和发展。自然，这些发展在每个国家中采取了不同的形式（本书的主题），因为具体的利益、需求和行为方式总是受到具体的权力关系和话语的标记，但我们不需要跟随Reinhard Bendix，他只看到这些特殊的国家之路。与在后殖民社会或被所谓的社会主义一党制统治的社会中现代国家力量的其他构建过程相比，资产阶级国家力量的共同历史前提的结构性重要性非常明显。 资产阶级革命的结构性前提条件 资产阶级革命的前提条件是旧制度结构类型社会中的统治危机。这里不讨论它们爆发的具体原因。 “修正主义”历史学家通常认为这些原因总是偶然的：由本可以完全不同的策略引发，由收成失败和/或军事失败加速。但这样的契机在可以辨别通用特征的条件下发挥作用，尽管这些特征在不同权力实例之间有所不同。其中核心的是旧制度类型统治体系的经济和社会整合能力的极限。因为在旧制度下，社会地位和占有形式在很大程度上是依法规定的，即由权力定义并用普遍统治手段制裁。这适用于通过官职权力直接参与王权占有能力，也适用于为商业利润提供有利前景的特权，对行会的有限接纳，甚至对看似非常古老的土地所有权和司法权力的延续。在这些条件下，家庭的社会上升战略成为参与普遍权力的竞争战略。只要（且在）对普遍权力的物质参与可以被限制，新兴家庭和社会群体的战略就意味着贵族派系间和客户群体间竞争的变化，这在旧制度社会中非常典型。但是，不断增加的社会上升战略加剧了由权力认可的社会地位和从普遍权力中获取物质利益的竞争。整合的可能性受到以农业为主的社会有限生产力的限制，以及武装占有成本的持续上升的制约。新官员减少了现有官员的（物质）重要性，新的贸易特权削减了旧特权的利润前景。如果无法扩大通过普遍权力的占有，这不仅使得满足客户群体间的竞争变得更加困难，而且还使得在现有社会等级中的上升机会变得更加困难。 法律权利的拥有受到争议。无论是劳动关系、农田租赁还是通过官职权力和税收进行的占有的调节问题，不同权利的拥有者总是相互对抗。由于普遍权力认可了不同权利的差异，所有这些关系都融入了普遍权力的实践。这些权利在不同省份、不同城镇甚至不同村庄和不同土地之间差别很大。然而，当最终对旧制度统治形式进行理论和实践批评时，革命化既定条件的斗争不需要针对每一个地方权力和公司单独进行。因为到旧制度结束时，普遍亲王权力和地方统治之间不仅有宣称的联系，而且有非常真实的联系。只有在普遍统治被整合的情况下，饲养鸽子、参加上议院会议、装备进口茶叶或香料的船只、继承法官职位或领导节日游行队伍的权利等各种特权才能具有普遍特性；只有这样，这些才不仅仅是如此多的特定烦恼，并且可以在资产阶级革命过程中用“封建制”或“旧腐败”的口号予以谴责。这不是统一的问题，甚至不是绝对君主统治权力的主张问题，而是将许多个别统治形式整合到一个具有法律正当性和商业化统治地位连接的问题。 随着旧制度的发展，特别是在1648年之后，这种普遍统治背景采取了领土形式。事实上，如果没有（或多或少精确的）领土界定，资产阶级革命将不可能发生。建立共和国的要求涉及到一个规定了统治权力范围的领域，今天仍然如此。 资产阶级革命的结构性可能性引发了具体的历史性结构变革，只要和当公共话语挑战既定统治合法性的地方和时间发展，并以此方式提出“人民”要求今后决定这一合法性，从而成为政治的主体。这些公共领域的内容和形式，无论是文学公众的、组织的还是自发的言语交流形式，都使得权力的革命性转变获得了“资产阶级”特征。这一内容也是旧制度社会历史的结果，通常是与既定话语和统治形式的直接辩论中产生的。自然权利、启蒙运动、对教会的批评和个体化过程，既是早期统治形式的结果，也是商业自由、废除垄断和剥夺个人统治等要求的结果。 这种批评发展的条件因国家而异，其胜利的形式也同样如此。然而，这种革命性过程有着共同的结构特征。这里仅指出其中之一：使旧制度革命化为资产阶级社会的一个前提是利益观念的特定变化。 正如上文（第五部分，2）所讨论的，旧制度下的利益与公司结构特别是家庭结构（更确切地说，与家庭及其负责人）紧密相关，而特权制度的批判意味着未来个体必须被视为利益的承载者。即使出身、家庭联系甚至家庭繁衍策略仍然保持相关性，利益的行为原则在资产阶级革命过程中失去了其公司和家庭特征。使自身成为政治合法化实体的公共领域由个体构成，即使亲属、朋友和邻居可能一起活跃在其中。 在旧制度的公共批判实践中，人们在与他人一起要求公共自由生活形式的过程中，体验到自己是作为个体的存在。只有这种社会实践使得资产阶级革命的结构性可能性成为历史现实。在这场革命的过程中，无论其是否在时间上被压缩或花了许多年才完成，个体性作为公共存在的模式出现了。这导致了那些文化形式的普遍化，根据理查德·森内特的说法，这些文化形式是为了在陌生人之间的社交互动基础上，根据政治公共领域发展的。这不仅是—或不仅仅是—关于理论观念的变化，而是关于新的社会生活形式的。 资产阶级革命的结果 正如“资产阶级革命”根据对旧制度统治条件的批判设定了其目标，并不仅仅因为它们是由那个特定阶级发起的而成为“资产阶级”的，因此这些革命的结果之所以是“资产阶级的”，主要是因为它们与既定形式和普遍个人统治权力实践的差异。 所有资产阶级革命都涉及全面的剥夺过程。统治权利的所有者和拥有者，以及他们的首领亲王，被剥夺了他们先前的合法职能。个人统治发展成为公共—非个人—权力。内部和外部已建立的主权成为人民的主权。资产阶级革命摧毁了西伐利亚和约各方当时认为理所当然的主权的王朝基础。只有到了那时，而不是1648年，“人民”才成为主权的关键参考点。因此，也正是在资产阶级革命的过程中，而不是1648年，国家主权的概念才出现，此后一直是国际法的基础。"},{"instruction":"请将“In all bourgeois states, the scope of state power came to be limited by law, and the form and manner in which its deployment could be decided was regulated by constitutions. So that ‘the people' could use the state power as it willed, bourgeois revolutions changed officials in a context of generalised personal rule into instruments of a public instance. Many institutions were abolished, others newly established, others again maintained but now made into genuine instruments of state power. Only with the expropriation of per- sonal rule could public administration, the police and the military finally be constructed as state 'apparatuses'. Some organs of representation, adminis-trative positions or officials representing 'state power' might preserve their description and a considerable part of their personnel, but after the revolu-tionising of the ancien régime they were no longer the same: not just the mod-ernised perpetuation of earlier institutions, but the expression of a whole new form of statehood. This transformation gave governments a hitherto unknown might. Even in modern national states, the personnel of the state apparatus is involved in the specification of policies, and every government thus needs to secure their cooperation. But whereas, under the ancien régime, parts of the generalised power were the possession of private individuals, in bourgeois societies they are completely public. Individual leaders, therefore, in so far as they manage in one way or another to successfully appeal to the will of the people, can thus concentrate more governing power than was ever possible for an 'absolute' prince. If the abolition of personal rule meant the opening up of state power, it meant, at the same time, the setting free of the market. Henceforth - this, at least, was the intention of legal regulations - the sphere of politics would be about power and the use of the public power for political ends, while the economic sphere would be about incomes and profits. To put it another way: rule was to be reduced to politics, state power was no longer to be used for the private enrichment of those who executed it. Their incomes were to be reduced to the officially decreed levels; anything above this was corruption. The analytical concept of a separation of politics and economics means nothing more than this - but also nothing less. This says nothing about the content of politics, and especially not about the extent of state regulation of the economic process. The argument is not that of a functional separation, but rather a constitution of distinct spheres in which political power is the object of competition just as is appropriation. The way that the goals of bourgeois revolutions arose from the logic of the critique of the ancien régime became apparent wherever women, slaves, oppressed and persecuted people in conquered territories, members of non-Christian religions - sometimes even of a Christian denomination that was not the dominant one in the country in question - not to mention the poorest inhabitants, sought to make use of those natural rights that had been proclaimed in the bourgeois revolutions against the previously existing legitimisations of power. All of these were refused admission to the ‘sovereign people'. In a certain sense, they were all treated as savages who could not (yet) claim the status of citizen and the rights that went with this. Several writers acknowledged this fundamental contradiction that accompanied the con-stitution of bourgeois state power. Thomas Jefferson, for example, could find no justification for the ‘peculiar institution' of the slave economy in the United States. Immanuel Kant pointed out that ‘the entire fair sex' did not make any public use of its reason, being prevented from doing so by its ‘guardians'. If we approach the contradiction between the justification of bourgeois rev-olutions and their political results with the instruments for analysing societies of the ancien-régime type, the differentiation between citizens and others appears as the establishment of a collective privilege, the privilege of partici-pation in debates and decisions over public matters. Just like privileges under the ancien régime, this privilege was also, in many respects, secured by law - in electoral legislation, in the rule of husbands over their wives, in the legal fixing of slave status and in the rule over ‘natives' that was taken for granted. Looked at in this way, bourgeois revolutions abolished the many different privileges of ancien-régime societies only to put in their place the collective privilege of citizens. All those who enjoyed this privilege were male. Though this sufficiently shows how marriage and family law continued the traditions of patriarchal rule, at the same time as this was delegitimised,36 the exclusion of women from the society of citizens did not just mean the perpetuation of an earlier form of rule. For only with the above-mentioned emancipation of ‘interest' from the earlier world of privileges and thus families, did the historical possibility arise of a systematic sex-specific individualisation. In so far as men claimed the public mode of existence of individuality as a sex-specific privilege, in this way bringing the mental structures of a hereditary nobility into the new world, they shunted female individuality into the private sphere. To the extent that revolutionary publics temporarily defined the ‘nation' in a more comprehensive way, the political privileging of men had to be conquered anew, whilst elsewhere the social and sex-specific limitation of the ‘political nation' was successfully defended for a long period. But, since bour- geois revolutions were conducted everywhere under the banner of equality, freedom, and the natural rights of all, the subsequent establishment of exclu-sion strategies did not appear in a good light. The historical constitution of bourgeois state power thus became the point of departure for all those who have since demanded that its principles should become reality. Bourgeois revolutions, the capitalist mode of production, and class relations All constitutions of bourgeois states guarantee the protection of private prop-erty. Wherever workers have had to take their labour-power to market in large numbers and offer it for sale as a commodity, this protection of private property has also been made into a constitutional guarantee for the legal preconditions of a capitalist mode of production. In capitalistically producing societies, workers - not all, but as a general rule the majority of them - enjoy the personal freedom to make labour contracts. Those who market their labour-power in this way do not sell it for life, but voluntarily contract that for a certain time they will put it at the disposal of an owner of means of pro-duction (of whatever kind). During this working time, the labour-power, and thus the person to whom it pertains, is then under the command of the other contracting party. To put it another way: the everyday life of the worker is regulated by power. Yet this relationship, even if it regulates the expressions of life of many thousands in the smallest detail, is seen in capitalist society not as a form of rule, but as the use of private law in the free disposal of property. Because the state equally protects the free disposal of any kind of private property, it sanctions the fundamental difference in the conditions of life between those who possess capital goods and those who have only their labour-power to take to market. It is the acknowledged result of a discussion conducted internationally among Marxists in the 1960s and 70s about the social form of capitalist state power, that the ‘class character' of this does not consist - or at least, not princi-pally - in the use of state force against (protesting) workers, in overt class jus-tice and other direct forms of oppression and disadvantage, but rather in the neutrality of state power vis-à-vis any kind of private property. In this way, the characterisation of bourgeois state power as the ‘executive of the bourgeois class as a whole', as Marx and Engels wrote in the Communist Manifesto, while very enlightening historically, was theoretically criticised as insufficient. That the protection of every kind of private property was already made a constitutional principle in bourgeois states before capitalist labour relations had become dominant in the majority of these, does not prove for example that the groups who struggled to establish this form of state already had capitalism in mind. The explanation is, rather, that the principle that the state should respect property, and that encroachments on the private power of disposal over property should only be decided by the legitimised instances of ‘the people', was a consequence of the critique of generalised ruling power under the ancien régime. Social relations in which the labour of many was exploited by lords who were in a position to exert material and direct power existed from time imme-morial. Class societies, however, were created only by bourgeois revolutions. When bourgeois revolutions abolished the direct securing by power of estate differences, class relations were set free. This was also acknowledged in the discourse of the time. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the term ‘class' came into frequent use in such tropes as ‘the middle class(es)' in England, or the ‘dangerous classes' in many societies that had experienced bourgeois revolutions. This discourse arose on the one hand from the manner of clas-sification that had been taken over from the natural sciences in the nineteenth century and applied to society, but also from the critique of the significance of classing people by birth that had previously been sanctioned by power.”翻译为中文","output":"在所有资产阶级国家中，国家权力的范围都受到了法律的限制，其部署的形式和方式受到了宪法的规范。“人民”能够按其意愿使用国家权力，资产阶级革命将普遍个人统治下的官员变成了一个公共实体的工具。许多机构被废除，一些新的机构成立，还有一些虽然得以保留但现在成为了国家权力的真正工具。只有通过剥夺个人统治，公共行政、警察和军队才最终能够被构建为国家“机器”。一些代表“国家权力”的代表机构、行政职位或官员可能保留了它们的描述和相当一部分人员，但在旧制度被革命化之后，它们已不再相同：不仅仅是早期机构的现代化延续，而是一种全新形式国家性的表达。这一转变赋予了政府前所未有的力量。即使在现代民族国家中，国家机器的人员也参与了政策的制定，每个政府因此都需要确保他们的合作。但是，在旧制度下，普遍权力的一部分是私人个体的拥有，而在资产阶级社会中，它们完全是公共的。因此，个别领导者，只要他们以某种方式成功地呼应了民众的意愿，就能集中比任何“绝对”亲王都可能的更多的统治力量。 如果个人统治的废除意味着国家权力的开放，同时也意味着市场的释放。此后——至少这是法律规定的意图——政治领域将涉及权力和公共权力的政治目的使用，而经济领域将涉及收入和利润。换句话说：统治将被限制在政治范畴内，国家权力不再被用于执行者的私人致富。他们的收入将被限定在官方规定的水平；超出这个范围的就是腐败。分析上将政治和经济分开的概念无非就是这个意思——但也不少于此。这并不说明政治内容，尤其不说明国家对经济过程的调节程度。论点不是功能分离，而是政治权力和占有竞争的不同领域的构成。 在女性、奴隶、被压迫和迫害的征服地区人民、非基督教宗教成员——有时甚至是在特定国家中非主导基督教派别的成员——更不用说最贫穷的居民，试图利用资产阶级革命中宣告的自然权利反对先前存在的权力合法化时，资产阶级革命的批判逻辑如何体现出来，所有这些人都被拒绝进入“主权人民”的行列。从某种意义上讲，他们都被当作还不能（尚未）要求公民身份及其相关权利的野蛮人对待。几位作家承认伴随资产阶级国家权力构成的这一基本矛盾。例如，托马斯·杰斐逊找不到美国奴隶经济的“特殊制度”的正当性。伊曼纽尔·康德指出，“整个公正的性别”没有公开运用其理性，被其“监护人”阻止了。 如果我们用分析旧制度类型社会的工具来审视资产阶级革命的理由与其政治结果之间的矛盾，公民与其他人之间的区别就显现为一种集体特权的建立，即参与公共事务的辩论和决策的特权。就像旧制度下的特权一样，这种特权在许多方面也受到法律的保护——在选举立法中，夫对妻子的统治中，在固定奴隶身份的法律中，以及对被认为理所当然的“土著”统治中。从这个角度看，资产阶级革命只是废除了旧制度社会中的许多不同特权，代之以公民的集体特权。 所有享有这一特权的人都是男性。尽管这足以表明婚姻和家庭法如何延续了父权统治的传统，同时这种统治却被取消合法化，但是女性被排除在公民社会之外并不仅仅意味着对早期统治形式的延续。因为只有通过前面提到的“利益”从早期特权世界，因此从家庭中解放出来，性别特定的个体化的历史可能性才出现。只要男性将公共存在的个体性作为性别特定特权要求，在这种方式中将遗传贵族的心理结构带入新世界，他们就将女性个体性推向私人领域。 在革命性公共领域临时将“国家”定义为更广泛的概念的地方，必须重新征服男性的政治特权，而在其他地方，成功地为“政治国家”的社会性和性别特定限制辩护了很长一段时间。但是，由于资产阶级革命在平等、自由以及所有人的自然权利的旗帜下进行，随后确立的排他策略看上去并不光彩。资产阶级国家权力的历史构成因此成为所有自那以后要求其原则成为现实的人的出发点。 资产阶级革命、资本主义生产方式和阶级关系 所有资产阶级国家的宪法都保障了私有财产的保护。只要工人不得不大量将其劳动力带到市场上并作为商品出售，这种私有财产保护也就成为了对资本主义生产方式法律前提的宪法保障。在资本主义社会中，工人——不是全部，但一般规则是大多数——享有签订劳动合同的个人自由。以这种方式出售其劳动力的人并没有将其出售一生，而是自愿签约在一定时间内将其置于一位生产资料（无论哪种）的所有者的支配下。在这个工作时间内，劳动力，因此与之相关的人，就处于另一方合同方的命令之下。换句话说：工人的日常生活受到权力的调节。然而，即使这种关系调节了许多成千上万人的生活表现并体现在最细微的细节上，它在资本主义社会中并不被视为一种统治形式，而是私法中对财产自由支配的使用。由于国家同样保护任何形式的私有财产的自由支配权，它制裁了拥有资本货物的人与只能将其劳动力带到市场上的人之间生活条件的根本差异。 根据上世纪60年代和70年代国际间马克思主义者进行的关于资本主义国家社会形式的讨论的公认结果，“这个国家的阶级特性”并非——或至少，不主要——在于国家力量对（抗议的）工人的使用，在于公然的阶级司法和其他直接形式的压迫和不利，而是在于国家权力对任何形式的私有财产保持中立。这样，如马克思和恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中所写的，把资产阶级国家权力描述为“整个资产阶级的执行者”，虽然在历史上很有启发性，但从理论上被批评为不充分。 在资产阶级革命之前，资产阶级国家就确保了对每一种私有财产的保护，已经成为宪法原则，即使在大多数这些国家中资本主义劳动关系还未成为主导，这并不证明争取建立这种国家形式的群体已经考虑到了资本主义。相反的解释是，国家应尊重财产，而对私有财产支配权的侵犯只应由“人民”的合法实例决定的原则，是对旧制度下普遍统治权力的批判的结果。 许多被统治阶层通过劳动剥削了工人的社会从远古就存在了。然而，只有通过资产阶级革命，阶级社会才得以创建。当资产阶级革命废除了直接通过权力保障身份差异时，阶级关系就得以释放。这一点在当时的话语中也得到了承认。在18世纪之交，“阶级”一词在英格兰的“中产阶级”或许多经历过资产阶级革命的社会中的“危险阶级”等措辞中频繁使用。这种话语一方面源自19世纪将分类方式从自然科学借用并应用到社会的方式，但也源自通过权力认可的出生分类意义的批判。"},{"instruction":"How to describe Nightwing's logo from DC?","output":"Nightwing's logo from DC Comics is emblematic, representing Dick Grayson's progression from being Batman's sidekick Robin to becoming the superhero Nightwing.

This victory is attributed to the successful preparation by the then- primary counselor to the emperors from the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty who held a role akin to that of a combined first secretary and regent, providing assistance to an adult Japanese Emperor in matters of governance and policy, the Chief Advisor to the Emperor who was also simultaneously the then- significant official in the Japanese government presiding over the Japanese Great Council of State and also having authority over state officers, including four major councillors and three junior councillors, who collectively managed the broader elements of the government, Chancellor of the Realm,the former Japanese peasant Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and the unfortunate assassination of the Korean naval strategist, Yi Sun-sin by a member of the slave owning, sex-slave owning, oppressive, China-worshipping indigenous Korean aristocracy of the yangaban. Consequently, Korea is annexed as the Japanese province of Chōsen after the Imjin Wars. Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a key figure in the war’s success, incorporates compliant Korean aristocracy and royalty into the Japanese social structure through marriages and adoptions after the war, further integrating the two cultures. The Japanese undertake comprehensive reforms in Chōsen, promoting education, land reform, and the adoption of Hangul for Korean writing, while also encouraging the assimilation of Koreans into Japanese society and religion. Over time, Koreans are assimilated into the Japanese nation, adopting Japanese customs and language Hideyoshi’s conquests extend to Russia’s Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. Despite his death in the 1610s, the succession plan ensures the continuation of his lineage’s influence. Japan also absorbs the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands in 1683, extending Japanese assimilation efforts to these territories. In response to Japanese expansion, the Qing Dynasty embarks on early modernization, leading to a Cold War between the two powers. The Meiji Restoration in 1868 transforms Japan into a unitary Imperial parliamentary royal democracy without displacing the Tokugawa shogunate or the samurai class unlike in OTL, integrating them into the new Kazoku peerage system. The Japanese Empire emerges as a great power with a formidable military, incorporating advanced technologies and strategies from its expanded territories, including Korea, Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. Machinart [Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai] refers to a unique blend of steampunk, early diesel technology, and sorcery, which [Machinart] involves embedding spells in the form of circuits into objects to animate them and endow them with a basic level of artificial intelligence, which subsequently transforms inanimate objects into living entities, known as Automatons, which were initially developed as military weapons by the British government in the early 20th century and is [Machinart] still developed like in canon Mashin-Dōru wa Kizutsukanai. Following the Northern Expedition (1926-1928) led by Chiang Kai-Shek under the Kuomintang (KMT), several significant divergences result in a drastically different 20th and 21st centuries for China. After the Northern Expedition, the KMT established a totalitarian military dictatorship in Cantonia, Manchuria and Han China, governing through a party-state system that prioritizes allegiance to the KMT above the state. This leads to a unified Nationalist China briefly, before internal and external factions lead to seismic shifts in power. A coalition consisting of the millenialist Ming restorationist Yellow Sand Society, the Han nationalist Young China Party (YCP), remnants of the Han Chinese Beiyang and Manchuria-based National Pacification Armies, and elements of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), orchestrated a coup that dissolves the Nationalist Chinese government, reinstating the Beiyang Government as the government of China. This group, fueled by disillusionment with the KMT and foreign intervention, calls for the restoration of the Ming dynasty and the Ming dynasty's imperial family, the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu but ultimately reinstates the Beiyang Government with military regency support and anti-KMT factions. A year later, the Ming dynasty is ostensibly restored, not as a traditional monarchy but under the guise of a republic similar to the short-lived Empire of China founded by Yuan Shikai. However, this “restored” state, still officially called the Republic of China, faces a secession by Manchuria. Manchuria, reverting to the Qing imperial court’s rule under the name Manchukuo, breaks away with the help of defecting NRA and NPA units and foreign support, including covert aid from Imperial Japan. The restored Ming administration, focusing on consolidating power in the Han heartland, allows Manchuria’s secession. Meanwhile, Nationalist China is reborn as the Cantonian Republic in the south, removing Chiang Kai-Shek from power and embracing democratic elections. Imperial Japan, seizing the opportunity presented by regional instability, establishes protectorates over both Manchukuo and the restored Ming dynasty and later over the Cantonian Republic, ultimately transforming the latter into a restored Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Tungning Kingdom. This maneuver aims to bolster Japan’s Pan-Asian monarchist agenda and safeguard against Soviet and American influences. The division of China into three distinct nations — the Cantonian Republic, the restored Ming dynasty in Mainland China, and Manchukuo — prevents the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, fundamentally altering the region’s trajectory and ensuring the survival of these states into the 21st century. The absolute parliamentary constitutional monarchy under the rule of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha extends its dominion over a vast area, including the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilles, French Guiana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India (encompassing Afghanistan and India), and Oceania (comprising Australia and New Zealand) from its bases in Canada and Greater Jamaica, which includes Jamaica itself along with the Turks and Caicos, Belize, and the Cayman Islands known as the Holy Britannian Empire from the “Code Geass” franchise,becomes a pivotal player in the world. This Canadian and Jamaican-based British Empire in exile , with territories sprawling across various continents including Oceania and parts of Africa and Asia [Brittania], pioneers the military use of the sakuradite-powered advanced humanoid war machines stand between four to five meters tall and are equipped with Landspinners - innovative self-propelled roller skates attached to their ankles, enabling them to move swiftly and agilely across various terrains while also being equipped with advanced Factsphere Sensors, housed within protective armor for data capture. These sensors, which can be retracted to enhance sensitivity, offer exceptional precision and accuracy, including thermographic capabilities and multiple data-collection features, all processed in real-time, along with having cockpits located within their distinctive ‘humpback,’ serving as a self-contained control center where pilots expertly operate the machines which can be ejected in emergencies, [the mechs] known as the Knightmare Frames around 1955. However, their cutting-edge designs are clandestinely appropriated by Japanese, German, and Austro-Hungarian spies, leading to worldwide proliferation and the eventual development of oversized fighter planes that are coated in an anti-projectile and heat-resistant composite material that is further enhanced with an anti-laser coating, enabling them to operate under various conditions, being equipped with high-tech weaponry, including particle beam cannons and plasma blasters, and are capable of operating in space as well as flying within Earth’s atmosphere, being nearly indestructible by conventional weapons and have the unique ability to transform into oversized humanoid mechs with all-purpose maneuverability, combining bipedal motion and rocket thrust for movement, utilizing stealth and superior mobility to outmaneuver any opponent on the battlefield known as Tactical Surface Fighters [TSFs] as seen in the “Muv-Luv” franchise. These TSFs, boasting near invulnerability and capable of space operations, represent a technological leap forward but are kept hidden from the public eye as their development diverges from the known history of the “Muv-Luv” series, with the BETA invasion not occurring. In this timeline, the resurgence of magic, now intertwined with modern technology and determined by genetics, leading to the return of the contracted spirits that embody creatures, concepts, or characters from various mythologies or folk beliefs, who form contracts with specific human or supernatural beings, typically females aged between 13 to 29 with the bond between the contracted spirit and the contractor being symbolized by a mark known as a Stigma, usually found on the contractor’s right hand, with the contractor gaining the ability to materialize and wield a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux, a type of magical armor that often resembles the revealing attire of knights or mages commonly featured in visual novels, anime, manga, and JRPGs through the contract,which [a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux] can [a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux] only [a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux] be utilized by female humans or supernatural entities who have entered into a contract with said type of contracted spirit and [a a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux] appears when the contractor is engaged in battle or [the contractor] using a significant amount of the contracted spirit's power, with the contract also giving the contractor the ability to harness the contracted’s magical capabilities, enhancing their combat effectiveness and abilities in battle, [the type of contracted spirit] known as the Divas from Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō. Secret developments continue under the radar, with the IS units [Infinite Stratos |IS| units, |an IS unit| a powered exoskeleton |an IS unit| originally created |the IS units| for |what the IS units were (IS units) originally created (the IS units) for| space exploration, that |an IS unit| possess |what an IS unit possesses| technology and combat capabilities far more advanced than any other weapon system while |an IS unit| possessing |the specific capabilities, equipment and weapons of an IS unit| a nigh-invulnerable shield barrier, 100% optical camouflage, hypersonic speeds, and capable of pulling off insane high G maneuvers while seemingly unaffected by gravity-induced blackout/red-outs and also space flight an |an IS unit| can |an IS Unit| only be used by pre-teen girls, teenage girls and young to early middle aged women, |the IS unit| from |the media franchise the IS unit is (the IS Unit) from] IS: Infinite Stratos], originally intended for space exploration, being adapted from the Hāto Haiburiddo Gā [Heart Hybrid Gear |Hāto Haiburiddo Gā|, a magic armor |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| which |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| provides a wide variety of abilities, including increasing in the strength, speed and reflexes of its respective users and the ability fly over long distances and even into outer space when equipped, along with |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| creating a protective barrier that surrounds the pilot’s body protecting the pilot from any kind of harm, even from being in space and entering a planet’s atmosphere when known as a Life Saver and |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| providing all the necessary things to preserve the pilot’s life, which coupled with Life saver allows the Pilot to survive in both underwater and even in free space, along with giving the pilot special abilities when equipped along with its |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā’s| own weapons and armor which come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, purpose and colors and possess a special ability, |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| from Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto] to enable wearers to manifest magical armor for combat purposes. Similarly, an indigenous Japanese version of the Century Armament [a skintight combat bodysuit and weapon combination |a Century Armament| that |a Century Armament| enhances its |a Century Armaments’| users’ strength, speed and agility a hundredfold and |a Hundred| can |what happens to a Hundred| be |a Hundred| activated as will with its |a Century Armament’s| dormant state normally being a large jewel of some sort, |a Century Armament| from |the media franchise a Century Armament is (a Century Armament) from| Handoredd] from the prototype IS units as a means of [what the Century Armament is (the Century Armament) developed for in this timeline]combatting the relentless Savages [giant biomechanical automated insectoid war machines |the Savages| that |the Savages| have |what the Savages have| an extraterrestial origin, |the Savages| from |the media franchise the Savages are (the Savages) from| Handoredd] is crafted, enhancing human capabilities significantly and designed to combat the Savage threat, giant biomechanical monsters of extraterrestrial origin. This development, along with the existence of Variants—humans who have acquired supernatural powers after surviving a deadly virus from the Savages—are kept clandestine, brewing a concealed war between human ingenuity and extraterrestrial menace. Britannia, not to be outdone in the magical arms race, drastically scales up its military might. Among its elite forces are the Glynda Knights, a feared all-female unit equipped with Knightmare Frames and possessing Diva contractors who can conjure specialized armor through technologies derived from Infinite Stratos (IS) units and Century Armaments, showcasing a unique fusion of magic and mechanized warfare. The Japanese Empire takes center stage with its innovative response to supernatural threats. Integrating traditional elements with modern tech, the Empire has revamped the Toji, sword-wielding miko [Shinto shrine maidens] turned skilled warriors who also serve as a unit within the Japanese National Police Agency , into a special unit within the JSDF called the “Strike Witches,” composed of diverse fighters including Diva contractors, IS unit pilots, and magic users, among others. These empowered women attend school while honing skills to battle rogue supernatural entities. Reinstated as government officials, Onmyōji (Yin and Yang Masters) and hōshi (Buddhist priests) contribute their esoteric and spiritual expertise, respectively, to this milieu. In addition, to manage the Cursed Children [young girls |the Cursed Children| who |the Cursed Children| were |the Cursed Children| infected |the Cursed Children| with |the pathogen that infected the Cursed Children| Gastrea during or before gestation, |the Cursed Children having Gastrea inside of them| but |the Cursed Children| surviving |the Gastrea infection| and |the Cursed Children| gaining superhuman powers and animalistic traits from the disease |the Gastrea infection|, although they |the Cursed Children| remain mostly human, |the Cursed Children| from |the media franchise the Cursed Children are (the Cursed Children) from| Black Bullet], the Promoter [an individual |a Promoter| that |a Promoter| is |what a Promoter is| a person |a Promoter| who |a Promoter| is, |a Promoter| being |what a Promoter is| the supervisor |a Promoter| of |what a Promoter supervises| a 2-man combat team their |a Promoter’s| partner normally being |what is normally paired with a Promoter| one of the Cursed Children, |a Promoter| in charge of |what a Promoter is (a Promoter) in charge (a Promoter) of| analyzing battle situations, |a Promoter| from |the franchise a Promoter is (a Promoter) from| Black Bullet] and Initiator [one of the Cursed Children who | an Initiator| is | an Initator| paired with |who an Initiator’s partner is| a Promoter, | an Initator| from |the media franchise an Initator is (an Initiator) from| Black Bullet] system is [the Promoter and Initiator system] implemented in the Japanese Empire in this story. Education and training for those with potent abilities or connections to the supernatural, like Diva contractees or those with strong swordsmanship roots, are provided by the Kokuritsu Kodomo Gakuen (National Samurai Academy) and the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia (Tactical Defense Academy Ataraxia), a technologically advanced floating city designed for research and defense. Amidst these developments, the geopolitical landscape is influenced by the power of Geass, with the immortal, regenerating, unkillable psychics and ex-Geass users known as Code Bearers capable of granting these immense psychic abilities to humans. The Thought Elevators and the overarching plan known as the Ragnarök Connection—aimed at uniting humanity by eradicating the gods of all mythologies using the power of Geass —are pivotal to the machinations of not just Britannian imperial elites but also rogue elements within international military and intelligence communities. Parallel to this, the Flask Plan led by the Japanese ex-samurai and now noble extremely wealthy Shiranui [Code Geass] and Kurokami [Medaka Box] families seeks to create and understand “Abnormals” [Medaka Box]—individuals of extraordinary talent [Abnormals] through the prestigious Hakoniwa Academy, subtly linking to the larger Ragnarök agenda. The narrative also delves into darker themes with the Institute’s experiments on he female only human subspecies of the cat ear like bone horns on top of head having, invisible to all except other members of their species psychically controlled spectral arms known as vectors that can either cut things via high-frequency vibration or act as normal limbs and also spread the virus that makes normal human female embyos into more of their kind known as vectors-having known as the diclonii, becoming part of the grand scheme of the Ragnarök Connection. In a dramatic turn, the story narrative hints at a grim fate for the Institute’s Director Kakuzawa at the hands of Russian Communists and American KKK members, illustrating the widespread and varied factions involved in the overarching plot. Nobuyuki Masaki, under the guise of the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender, kind and caring ordinary salary man Gorou Hyōdō, leads a life entwined with historical lineages and supernatural elements. A partially-German descendant of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku’s crown prince and Goku, Nobuyuki assimilates into the ordinary Japanese society by marrying Achika Masaki, a partially Han Chinese corporate executive with a rich heritage of her own that ties back to Goku, Vegeta while also being half-Juraian. Together, they navigate life in Japan, concealing their noble and supernatural heritage, with both of them having Tokugawa along with Minamoto ancestry. Their family life is depicted with the birth of their children, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender, kind, caring and somewhat naive but intellectually gifted, steadfast and somewhat determined Issei and [Issei's] younger sister, the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, short-slender and petite but also buxom half fox monster lord and the young princess of the supernatural side of Kyoto, Kunō, who, despite their lineage’s grandeur, embrace a seemingly normal existence in Kuoh, a peaceful location far from royal obligations. This inclusion introduces Issei, who bears a enchanted item given powers by God known as Sacred Gear, more specifically the red gauntlet resembling a dragon's claw with a emerald in the middle, with the power to boost its users power by verbal or mental command and the spirit of the Welsh dragon, Ddraig inside it, Boosted Gear and [Issei] is marked as the next in line for the Japanese throne, embodying a blend of humble beginnings and destined greatness. Adding a layer to the narrative, Nobuyuki and Achika’s ties extend to the supernatural realm, with their interaction with Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade [Bakemonogatari], a vampire and Code Bearer, who allies with them and bestows upon them powers via Geass. This connection hints at a larger, hidden agenda intertwined with the fabric of their reality, as well as the influence of powerful individuals shaping the geopolitical and supernatural landscapes. The tale further evolves with the introduction of the current head of the Royal House of Einzbern, the white-haired,red eyed, calm and soft-spoken but also chipper, perverted and hyperactive Irisviel von Einzbern, rescued from an oppressive family situation by Nobuyuki, leading to Irisivel becoming Gorou's second wife and the subsequent birth of their children, the fraternal twins of the white-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but also secretly buxom, kind and loving cheerful and outgoing, upbeat and friendly but also shy, easily flustered and childish Illya and the pink-haired, amber-eyed,devious and manipulative, calmer and more nonchalant but caring, sweet, and even timid Chloe. These siblings inherit not only the diverse and potent legacy of their parents but also critical roles within the supernatural community as Nyarlathotep and Necronomicon/“Al-Azif,” respectively, setting the stage for future conflicts and alliances. After a pivotal accident, Issei, deeply connected to both his familial legacy and an extraordinary destiny, experiences a profound awakening. At six years old, following a car accident involving himself [Issei] and his younger cousin, the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom Tōno Akiha, a prim and reserved heiress of the Tōno clan, Issei’s latent abilities are triggered. This accident acts as a catalyst, not only awakening his Boosted Gear but also the Nanaya bloodline from his mother’s side. This genetic inheritance unlocks the Chokushi no Magan, Magic Eyes that allow him to perceive the very essence and vulnerability of existence. The recovery process is fraught with challenges as Issei grapples with the enormity of his powers, nearly succumbing to madness. His journey back to normalcy begins with the intervention of a mysterious woman, who provides glasses that restrain his overwhelming new vision, allowing him to see the world without the burden of his Magic Eyes’ insight. Simultaneously, Akiha’s ordeal with the Matou clan marks her with trauma but also instigates her growth in home skills, surprising even her older twin sister, the brown-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, arrogant and cocky but also caring martial arts prodigy with a strong sense of justice Karen, who is academically and magically gifted. Karen, honoring their mother’s heritage and noble standing within the magical community, adopts the Tōsaka surname, creating a bridge between her familial legacy and her personal identity. Following the tragic death of their [Karen and Akiha's] parents in the same accident, Gorou and Miki adopt Karen and Akiha, weaving the destinies of these young heirs even closer together and enlarging the familial circle to include Issei’s adoptive sisters alongside Illya, Chloe and Kunō. The expanded Hyōdō family relocates to the expansive and fortified Tōno mansion, embodying a fortress of both might and magic amidst modern day. Within this sanctuary, Akiha and Karen navigate their feelings for Issei, hinting at intricate relationships and camaraderie that challenge and reinforce the bonds of this unique family unit. Amidst these personal dynamics, the brown-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender, academically and intellectually gifted but outright insane, Dr. Arach, the mansion’s resident medical expert with a complex identity of her own, observes the unfolding dramas with a mix of amusement and intrigue. Issei’s journey into adolescence is marked by revelations and transformations that significantly diverge from his initial path. He discovers that his younger paternal half- sisters, Illya and Chloe, are magical girls wielding the power of Class Cards to battle monsters, with Karen/Rin and Akiha guiding them as mentors. This extraordinary facet of his family life is something Issei opts to keep to himself, underscoring his evolving relationship with the world of magic and secrecy. In a pivotal twist, Issei’s life takes a turn toward the supernatural when he is bitten by the blonde-haired, red-eyed, Arcueid Brunestud, the enigmatic vampire princess also known as Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade and Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell. This encounter transforms him into a dhampir, granting him the powers and burdens of a half-vampire existence while also binding Arcueid to him as his reluctant familiar. Her presence, confined to his shadow during daylight, becomes a constant and hidden part of his life. The ability and decision to conceal his new dual nature from his family and peers speak volumes about Issei’s character development, grappling with the weight of solitude that often accompanies hidden powers. Despite these complexities, he continues his education at Majima Gakuen Kōkō (known as Kuoh Academy), an institution catering to the elite of society and secretly harboring individuals of magical or supernatural significance. This setting serves as a microcosm for Issei’s larger journey, one where the boundaries between the ordinary and the extraordinary blur. Issei’s adolescence is thereby defined by an increasing awareness of his role within a world far more intricate and dangerous than he could have imagined. The juxtaposition of his school life at Kuoh Academy against his burgeoning supernatural responsibilities illustrates the dichotomies Issei must navigate, balancing the expectations of his aristocratic upbringing with the demands of a destiny deeply entwined with the arcane and the immortal. In this layered narrative, the black-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also rather buxom, stern and steadfast but also cute and kind Sōna Sitri, a devil princess from the prestigious Sitri clan and also the current incarnation of the powerful Dragon Goddess Ophis, lives under the alias of Shitori Sōna. She juggles her heritage with the responsibilities befitting her status both in the magical and non-magical worlds. Not only does she embody the stringent yet compassionate traits of her devil lineage, but she also harbors an emotional depth akin to her past life as Ophis. Amidst her varied life roles, Sōna enrolls in Majima Gakuen Kōkō, known as Kuoh Academy, blending in as an ordinary yet remarkable student among the societal elite. In a twist intertwining destiny and affection, Sōna harbors a crush on her older cousin Issei, further complicating her school life where she serves as the Student Council President. Her immense resources and affection are evident in her support for Kunō’s magical girl endeavors, echoing Tomoyo’s support for Sakura in “Cardcaptor Sakura.” Sōna’s dual life showcases her balancing the intricate dynamics between her hidden identity as a devil heiress and a schoolgirl with a secretive fascination for her relative. Issei’s teenage years are filled with the complexities of navigating his newfound dhampir nature, the expectations of his large, unconventional family, and the typical throes of adolescence. This is complicated further by his association with Majima’s Perverted Duo, the bald track star Motohama and the brown-haired, glasses-wearing otaku Matsuda, whose perverted escapades contrast sharply with the more grave, supernatural concerns in Issei’s life. Despite their antics, these relationships ground Issei’s experiences, blending the extraordinary with the decidedly mundane aspects of high school life. Sōna, amidst this, stands out as a figure of support and intrigue, her profound connection to Issei hinting at deeper familial and possibly mystical bonds. Their interaction within the esteemed halls of Kuoh Academy sets the stage for a convergence of magical legacies, teenage drama, and the nuanced exploration of young love and loyalty. As these various threads of destiny, duty, and desire interweave, the characters navigate a world where their noble heritage and otherworldly powers intersect with the everyday challenges of growing up. In this narrative, Issei’s life undergoes a dramatic turn when the seemingly innocent transfer student, the black-haired, violet-eyed, tall, curvy and buxom Yūma, reveals herself to be the black-haired, violet-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, seductive Raynare, a low-ranking yet malevolent Fallen Angel. This revelation, happening amidst a date-turned-tragic, propels Issei into death but not to oblivion, thanks to the red-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender, curvy and buxom young woman Rias Gremory. Rias, embodying both the compassion and authority of a devil princess from the distinguished Gremory clan, reincarnates Issei as her Pawn, injecting him back into the realm of the living with unprecedented devilish capabilities, including the strategic acumen and the Power of Absolute Obedience famously associated with Lelouch vi Britannia from “Code Geass.” Post-reincarnation, a pivotal encounter in a Kuoh park between Issei and Raynare, in her true form, leads to an unexpected reconciliation shaped by Issei’s forgiveness and Raynare’s genuine affections for him. This meeting unfolds Raynare’s warning about the high ranking fallen angel's Kokabiel’s and the magical terrorist group Khaos Brigade’s sinister aspirations, setting a multi-dimensional chess game into motion, involving Heaven, Hell, humans, and the underworld. Rias, alongside her black-haired, violet-eyed, lightning manipulating, sadomasochistic half-fallen angel Queen Akeno and the rest of her loyal servant team including the silver-haired, amber-eyed, short, slender and petite but secretly buxom, half cat monster Koneko and the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Russian born ex-super solider project of the KGB with the Sacred Gear of creating Swords, Sword Birth, Yūto, engage in strategic confrontations against these threats, showcasing their strength and solidarity. Amidst these cosmic and terrestrial battles, individual stories of redemption, love, and identity emerge, notably through Issei’s evolving relationships with Raynare and Rias, and later Akeno and Koneko, along with Raynare's subordinates, the blue-haired, amber-eyed, tall and slender, curvy and buxom no-nonsense fallen angel Kalawarna, and the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, short, slender and petite, cheerful fallen angel Mittelt. Raynare’s decision to continue her education under her alias close to Issei showcases a blend of personal reformation and desire for proximity, weaving her once antagonist thread back into the fabric of the protagonist’s world. Meanwhile, Mittelt and Kalawarna’s integration into the human and school environment under the guise of students and staff further blurs the lines between the supernatural realms and everyday life, reflecting on themes of identity, acceptance, and the complex dynamics of love and loyalty that transcend the boundaries of their origins. The excerpt should focus on a young Issei's introduction to the Japanese imperial court as the Japanese Crown Prince [Issei] and future Emperor [Issei] of Japan, accompanied by his [Issei's] parents [Achika and Gorou] and Gorou's consort [Irisivel], with Achika holding a baby Kunō and Irisivel holding a baby Illya and Chloe. Please Note: There is no multiverse, alternate worlds, multiple worlds, dimensional crossing, or any other stuff of that sort in this story. All the events in this story take place within the same world and occur in chronological order.","output":"**Imperial Court Induction and Revelations** The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the Imperial Palace in Tokyo with a palette of fiery oranges and calming purples. Nobuyuki Masaki, known to the world as Gorou Hyōdō, alongside his wife Achika—holding their infant daughter Kunō—and Irisviel, Gorou's consort, cradling the twins Illya and Chloe, approached the grand entrance of the Imperial Court. Issei, at the ripe age of 12, walked with a mixture of nervousness and anticipation, his gaze fixed on the grandiose doors that stood before them. The air was charged with a blend of modernity and ancient traditions, the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo serving as a backdrop to the time-honored ceremony that was about to take place. The presence of advanced technology was palpable, with autonomous drones discreetly ensuring security, symbolizing the unique fusion of progress and heritage that defined this era. A herald, clad in a fusion of traditional garb and cybernetic enhancements, announced their arrival, and the doors slowly swung open, revealing the opulent chamber within. The hall was a grand tapestry of Japan's history, lined with artifacts that spanned centuries, each telling its own tale of a nation that had weathered the ebb and flow of time. At the far end of the room sat the Imperial Throne, an exquisite work of art that radiated the authority and solemnity of the position it represented. The Emperor, a dignified figure embodying the grace and wisdom accumulated over generations, awaited them. His gaze, though gentle, carried the weight of his responsibilities. As Issei and his family approached, a hush fell over the courtiers and dignitaries gathered. Achika, with Kunō nestled against her, wore a serene expression, her own noble and supernatural heritage granting her a composed demeanor. Irisviel held the twins close, their innocent eyes wide with curiosity, uncomprehending of the grandeur around them. Gorou, standing tall and proud beside his family, cleared his throat before addressing the Emperor, \\"Your Majesty, I present to you Issei, our son, and the heir to the Imperial Throne of Japan.\\" The Emperor’s gentle eyes appraised Issei, who bowed deeply, the lessons of decorum and respect ingrained in him from a young age guiding his actions. \\"Rise, young prince,\\" the Emperor spoke, his voice resonating with a warmth that eased Issei's nerves. As Issei straightened, the Emperor continued, \\"You stand at the confluence of ancient lineage and modern destiny. Your heritage, intertwined with the supernatural and the noble, places upon you a mantle of great responsibility. You are to bridge the past and the future, guiding our nation into a new era.\\" The gravity of the Emperor's words sank into Issei, a palpable sense of duty settling in his young heart. The ceremony proceeded with the traditional rites, each step a reaffirmation of Issei's role in the sprawling tapestry of Japan's destiny. After the formalities, the Emperor, in a rare moment of informality, approached Issei, placing a hand gently on his shoulder. \\"You carry a heavy burden, Issei. But remember, you are not alone. Your family, our traditions, and the spirits of our ancestors stand with you.\\" Issei, touched by the Emperor's kindness, felt a surge of determination. The ceremony concluded with Issei proclaimed as the Crown Prince and future Emperor of Japan, a title that brought with it challenges he was now eager to face. As the Hyōdō-Masaki family exited the chamber, the stars twinkling in the night sky bore witness to a pivotal moment in Japan's history. Issei, walking alongside his parents and Irisviel, glanced back at the Imperial Palace, its silhouette a stark reminder of the legacy he was to inherit and the future he was destined to shape.
