It has nothing to do with control on at it's core. A lot of people say it's a dream you can control, because once you become lucid, you can actively interact and manipulate the dream world. It is simply a dream in which you know you're dreaming. Astral projection is a form of an out-of-body-experience. Imagine your consciousness being separated from your physical body and entering your \\"astral body\\" (a form of being that is not limited by our know laws of the universe). When your consciousness is in the \\"astral body\\" it can freely explore various \\"realms\\" (often described as the astral plane.) Different cultures have different views on what the \\"astral plane\\" actually is. While there is often connections and overlapping accounts between lucid dreaming and astral projection, they are two separate experiences. You don't need to astral project in order to have a lucid dream and vice versa. It is also important to note that lucid dreaming has been scientifically proven (It's also been around for 1000s of years). While there are many historic accounts of astral projection (also an ancient spiritual practice), there is no scientific evidence that it is actually something we can experience it."},{"instruction":"Can you defend the line I don't like sand?","output":"No - I LIKE sand………….."},{"instruction":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","output":"I’ve been to [LINKED_TEXT: Borra Caves ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borra_Caves]( located on the East Coast of India, in the [LINKED_TEXT: Ananthagiri] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ananthagiri%2C_Visakhapatnam_district&action=edit&redlink=1] hills of the [LINKED_TEXT: Araku Valley] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araku_Valley]) in the month of June this year.

What makes a person different than human tissue. It’s pretty obvious that the guy walking down the street is a person and the scab that fell off my elbow is human tissue. But, where does a fertilized egg fall? I define a person as a blob of human tissue that has a working brain. Without a functioning brain there’s no personality, no individualism, and no thoughts or feelings. Brains form about month 5 or 6, so before that, it’s human tissue, not a human being. I firmly believe that if you don’t have the ability to raise a child, it’s your RESPONSIBILITY to abort before that blob of human tissue has a chance to become a person. To do otherwise isn’t being pro-life, it’s being pro-child abuse/neglect.

What is the difference in the usage in the context?","output":"The present perfect continuous tense is used when we talk about an action that started in the past and continues upto the present and it is likely that it might be in progress in the future as well, it's not necessary though. Example… “I have been living here for ten years.” ( Here the action “ living” started in the past and it constitutes even now and it is possible, not necessary though, that it continues in the days to come.) The past perfect tense is used when we talk about two past actions. Sometimes we have two actions, the moment the first action stops , the second one begins, in such a situation we use the past perfect tense for the first action and for the latter one we use the simple past tense. We need to keep in mind the fact that the past perfect tense is used along with the simple past tense. A couple of examples may help… “The driver who died in the accident had been drinking.” ( The first action “ drinking” stopped the moment the driver is dead. The first action takes the past perfect tense while the second one takes the simple past tense.) “He sang the same dong he had been rehearsing.” ( Here again, we have two actions… “ rehearsing” constitutes the first action which ceased as the second action “singing” started. The first needed the past perfect and the second required the simple past.) “He married the same girl, he had been dating.” ( Here again, we have two actions… “dating” and “ marrying” the first came to its end as the second action begun.)

No. Rather, they use ready-to-assemble word clusters which are fixed and standard expressions. take a walk, build a house, change the oil, avoid an accident, by mistake, in queue, at the top, take advantage of, pay attention, etc. You see, these type of word groups work as idea units. These clusters enable you to express your thoughts without having to worry about putting individual words together and worrying about grammar. They change the focus from how to form sentences to what you want to say. That said, never imitate others’ accents! You’d sound awful. You’d sound unauthentic. Native speakers don’t have an accent. It’s the way they speak. The best the foreign speakers can do is speak English in the way it should be spoken. We as foreign speakers assume English is spoken in the same way as our mother tongue. This makes it difficult to carry on conversation in English over longer periods of time even for people who know English quite well. English is spoken quite differently and none of the Indian/Asian language bears any resemblance. English has its own set of phrases, idioms, and collocations and its very own song-like way of speech. You see, English has a certain rhythm and not all words are pronounced equally. Some words are shortened, some words change form in Spoken English. For ex: 1. It is hell of a game. spoken as: isheləvəgame (notice ‘It’s’ became ‘Is’, ‘Of’ became ‘əv’, ‘a’ became ‘ə’) 2. The discount price is 10. Spoken as: thədiscoumpricis10 (notice ‘nt’ became ‘m’) 3. I’m not used to this kind of weather. Spoken as: əmnochoostothiskindəweather (notice ‘I’m’ became ‘əm’, ‘not used’ became ‘nochoosed’, ‘used to’ became ‘use to’, etc.) That brings us to: Syllables Every word in English has one or more syllables. A syllable is a vowel sound in a word. For ex: “Moon” has only 1 syllable “English” has 2 syllables viz. Eng, lish “Syllable” has 3 syllables viz. Sy, lla, ble “Ability” has 4 syllables viz. A, bi, li, ty And only one syllable is always stressed and other syllables are unstressed. The syllable which receives stress can be in any position. “Moon” should be always stressed as it’s the only syllable there. “English” has 2 syllables and stress falls only on first syllable and second syllable is unstressed: pronounced like “ENGlish” Stressed syllable gets longer time and unstressed syllables are rushed over. For ex, in “Impressive”, the stress falls on second syllable and it’s pronounced as “imPRESSive”. You should spend more time on “PRESS” and stress it and just glide over “im” and “ive” and shouldn’t stress them. “Schwa” In unstressed syllables, vowels often get reduced to a semi-vowel sound called ‘Schwa’. It’s written as inverted ‘e’ (“ə”). It’s the the sound between ‘s’ and ‘p’ in ‘supply’. the sound between ‘p’ and ’n’ in ‘company’. So in connected speech, “am” gets reduced to “əm”, “and” to “ən”, “was” to “wəs”, etc. These and other things are clearly explained in [LINKED_TEXT: Fluentzy: The Fluency Development Course] [URL: http://fluentzy.com/] by Prof. Kev Nair in detail. I have done this course and been still studying for almost 10 years. Now, Fluentzy course is the most comprehensive and very thorough. It’s one of a kind. Prof. Kev Nair is a well-known authority and is considered “The Father of Fluency Development”. It is a set of 20 books. It doesn’t teach grammar. It is for people who already know English quite well and want to speak fluently. It asserts self-study is the only way to true fluency as there are a number of factors at play in real-time conversations. You can’t plan for them nor can an instructor correct you. You just have to understand the principles of spoken English and practise rigorously. This course contains a huge collection of ready-built word groups and it explains in detail about how English should be spoken through a lot of rhythm drills. I’ll just give some highlights from this course.1. Foreign speakers learn English the wrong way. We are taught to write English rather than to speak first.2. There’s a lot of differences between written and spoken English.3. The right way to learn to speak is in word-groups instead of individual words.4. The way English is spoken is completely different from the way our languages are spoken.5. Fluency is achieved only when our ears and tongue are trained in English. We may know English but the tongue has to be taught in English ways. And ears have to stop being hesitant to English sounds.6. Fluency is achieved only through self-study, without any instructor, without any recordings. Any external means is a hurdle.7. We should get exposed to spoken English a lot. We should read novels written in loose, conversational style. Newspaper, non-fiction books, magazines, and like should be avoided as they’re written for different purpose and aren’t suitable from fluency perspective.8. We should avoid bilingual dictionaries and learn to think in English. We should buy at least one Advanced English dictionary and look up words for even simple words. Not any word, but fluency oriented words.

Meaning the elements on an antenna will look different. A TV antenna will have about 8 or more elements and stack closely together about 5 to 30 cm apart. And about 40 cm wide. A Radio antenna will have about 5 or less elements about 80 cm or more apart and about 1 m wide or more.the transmitting polarity might also differ, meaning sometimes the antenna must lay on its side to receive the best signals. TV,s antennas have a male coax plug on the antenna and some radios have a female coax plug on the cable or a speaker type clip on connector. Depending how far you are from the transmitter get a normal TV bunny ears and a male/female changer. The telescopic antenna works best as you can shorten or extend the height to adapt to the type of signal you need. Some radios only have a single strand of cable for FM antenna. For AM reception the antenna looks like a loop.

As debate and discussion on the topic continues, I think it is fair to say that it becomes more and more clear that there were engineering problems with the design of the Twin Towers, problems that occurred because the architects and engineers didn’t read enough science fiction. Their minds were frozen to lock out consideration of the new kinds of things that might happen. When somebody wants to do a cute demonstration of karate power, they stack up boards a couple feet long and a single foot wide, and they make spacers between the demonstration boards. They arrange it so that they are only breaking one board at a time. The top board breaks, its pieces hit the second board along with the karate’s fist, and the second single board breaks, and so forth. Now imagine that you do about the same thing except you use four chicken eggs, one on each corner of each block, and you stack up, say, 25 boards. On the 20th level out of 25 you insert a firecracker to represent the passenger airplane loaded with jet fuel. Light the firecracker and its blast raises the top five blocks a trifle, knocks the four eggs for that level out, and then the top five levels come crashing down on the 25th level, break the eggs directly under it, so now six levels come crashing down on the 24th level, and almost instantly this domino effect works its way down the line and all 24 boards hit the board on the bottom and all of this sequence is completed. Note that this process is not instantaneous. It’s not like having a charge planted on each level and wiring them all to a single firing switch. If somebody had tried to position a quarter passenger jet fuel load on whatever level it was where the passenger jet hit, among other little problems, they would have had to take over 4 pricey corner office suites and somehow sneak via elevator car-sized tanks up to that level, through the corridors and doors, and then arrange these tanks of fuel where they needed to be to knock out the principle supports. Unless I am mistaken, jet fuel is pretty smelly stuff, too. I’ve rarely been able to rig a makeshift transport device for some liquid and not have it leak — if not liquid to soak carpets with, at least fumes to make everybody lightheaded, headachy, and very alarmed by the smell that some would probably identify as kerosene. Having gone to all this trouble they would then have had to secure four teams of false air pilots with piloting experience and have them be good enough pilots to plow their planes into these buildings at exactly the time that the fuel tanks were rigged to explode. Besides all that, there were originally four planes. One never made it to the White House or wherever it was supposed to go. Why didn’t that target blow up “on time” like the rest of the buildings?"},{"instruction":"What does Galatians 2:21 mean?","output":"Note what Paul wrote in the whole letter, or at least from 2:16 to 21.

What do you mean by work? For example, you’ll no doubt say that (at least in the short term) gun violence decreased, but did every form of violence decrease? And remain at or near zero? What percent of those who had owned guns and committed no crimes with them take up violent crime? What percent of those given to violent crime give up their lives of crime and became law-abiding citizens? I could easily enough claim that it’s a fact that thousands of studies prove that Bubble Bees can’t fly. That neither means that Bumble Bees can’t fly or that there are thousands of studies.

Between 1922-1953 Jozef Stalin killed 23 MILLION people. Between 1943-1976 Mao Zedong killed 78 MILLION people. There's more, theres Kim II Sung, Pol Pot, Ismael Enver Pasha, Yokubu Gowon, the list goes on and on. All of these men started with taking away the people's ability to defend themselves from their government by confiscating their firearms. Could it happen here? I would think not and hope not, but history has shown time and time again it's a chance we can not afford to take. If you think you can trust that your government will always have your best interest in mind, you’re not just wrong, you’re hopelessly naive. In the U.S, Excluding suicides, 1.4 million people have been killed by guns from 1968-2011 The only examples ever needed showing why citizens should have modern firearms, are the battle of Athens Tennessee in 1946, and the Cliven Bundy ranch stand off in 2014.

While it is not accurate to make sweeping generalizations about an entire generation, there are some factors that have been suggested as possible contributors: Increased awareness and diagnosis: There is greater awareness and understanding of mental health issues today compared to the past. This awareness has led to more people seeking help and being diagnosed with depression.Stress and pressure: This generation faces unique challenges such as academic pressure, career uncertainty, financial burdens, and the impact of social media, which can contribute to stress and feelings of inadequacy or comparison.Social isolation: Despite increased connectivity through technology, social isolation and loneliness have become prevalent issues. Lack of social support and meaningful connections can contribute to feelings of depression.Economic factors: Economic instability and the difficulties in finding stable employment can lead to increased stress and a sense of hopelessness among young people.Environmental factors: Environmental issues, such as climate change and the resulting uncertainty about the future, can contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression. It's important to remember that depression is a complex condition influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. While these factors may be relevant, it's crucial to approach the topic with empathy and consider the individual experiences and unique challenges faced by each person. If you or someone you know is experiencing depression, it's important to seek professional help from a mental health expert."},{"instruction":"Can you describe a funny moment from boot camp?","output":"As a private, no.

Some years back, just before level off at FL360, I was in command of an Air India 737–800 when the airplane took a lightening strike that disabled both autopilots. The f/o and I alternated flying for a half hour each at a time. The flight from Cochin, India to Dubai, UAE took 3 1/2 more hours. It was exhausting! The airplane took 14 hours to repair in Dubai, so everything worked perfectly on the way back to Cochin. Its important to do at least some hand flying on each flight to maintain skills. I would normally hand fly from departure up to 25,000 feet before turning on the auto pilot just to keep my scan habits in shape."},{"instruction":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","output":"A lot of the details of such a question revolve around law, and law varies with where your properties are. I can give you an idea of how things work in Michigan, USA, and I understand that some other states have similar laws. But you need to check your local situation first. Certain jobs require state-licensed professionals. Electrical work is one, plumbing is another. In Michigan, a homeowner is allowed to work on his/her own property, but only if that is their primary residence. So I can run a new circuit to my home office, but I can’t add a laundry receptacle in my rental property. And all electrical work beyond plugging in a cord requires a permit and inspection from the local municipality. Maintenance work such as painting or floor sanding may not be covered by such laws, and you would have no problem doing those yourself. But check with the local AHD (authority having jurisdiction) first. Violating these laws can have consequences most people never think of. If your rental house burns down, the insurance company will send out an investigator before they pay the claim. If that investigator finds evidence of amateur workmanship, his next stop will be City Hall to look at the permit history. You may have trouble collecting on that insurance claim. And what about your liability for someone who was hurt or worse during that electrical fire? Best to hire a pro, and make sure their license is current and their insurance is paid up."},{"instruction":"w did aboriginal people not leave a bigger mark on the Australian landscape despite living here for over 60,000 years?","output":"The Australian indigenous people were (and some still are) hunter-gatherers. The Australian Indigenous people did not build cities. They didn’t mine. They didn’t grow cotton, wool, or flax for clothes and paper. They didn’t have a written history. They didn’t build roads. They didn’t irrigate or create sewerage systems. They didn’t invent a wheel or any form of transport. When they had twins, they snuffed one. Their weapons were mostly more primitive - a sharp stone and a sharpened stick. I’d always believed that the boomerang was their own invention but apparently not. The same goes for a spear thrower. When we colonised their land they were powerless against a single shotgun because they were mostly unarmed and they couldn’t join forces because they didn’t all speak the same language. They had no common leader. They travelled in small family groups (or tribes) and lived in harmony with the land. They traded food, and occasionally wives. They knew how to fish (by creating rock pools), hunt (with spears and boomerangs), and gather roots, fruit, and berries. They ate wild honey and some insects and grubs. They are believed to be the oldest living people who maintained their nomadic lifestyle without building cities or diversifying into mining or crop sharing. They have their own archaeological society, and many students come from Europe to work in the digs here as part of their PhD requirement. At such digs, you will find remnants of weapons that are simply sharpened sticks and stones, animal bones, and mollusc shells. Some ‘digs’ are actually piles - they’re called middens. You may find a carefully hidden burial site or a magic circle of stones. You might see some drawings on rocks. A midden is a dump for domestic waste which may consist of animal bones, human excrement, botanical material, mollusc shells, potsherds, and any other remains in large deposits. What we missed at colonisation, and what we know now, is that the Australian indigenous people were deeply spiritual, and practised very powerful magic. The signs of magic, however, will simply be a magic ring of stones otherwise called a Borra-ring or a Kippa-ring. You might also find a stone with a cone shaped hole cut in it. You might find some rock art. You might see the magical bone that was used by the kaditcha man. He could point that magic bone at bad people, tell them to lie down and die, and they did. ‘A kurdaitcha, or kurdaitcha man, also spelt gadaidja, cadiche, kadaitcha, karadji, or kaditcha, is a type of shaman amongst the aboriginal people of Australia’. As you can see, there was not much of a footprint to leave. Some indigenous people live exactly the same lifestyle in central Australia and in the Kimberlys, today. Many others are completely assimilated and live in cities and towns. For children in such families, a big challenge is finding some remnant of their past to take with them into their future. They have their own flag, and the can learn their art style in school art classes, but there are no photos and few artefacts. If you want a symbol of their society, you can purchase indigenous art online, or you can apply to participate in a dig."},{"instruction":"My baby chick cant stand after consuming a sprayed cockroach is there any cure for it?","output":"Unfortunately, probably not. the amount of insecticide would be extremely toxic to a small chick.

How on earth did Tesla manage to pull this off, while other companies including Google have been trying to do it for years?","output":"Google is aiming for a car which doesn't need a driver and ultimately doesn't even allow for a driver (ie: no steering wheel, etc.). Tesla, and basically every auto maker out there, is aiming for a car that helps a driver drive. The same way cruise control didn't remove the gas pedal but simply let you not have to use it in some situations. It won't get you from point A to point B while you sleep but it will make the drive easier and safer. Tesla also isn't doing anything dramatically new since a lot of cars already have lane following, distance keeping, self-parking, etc, etc."},{"instruction":"w can I apply for a birth certificate online, and when will it come to me?","output":"Hello , Firstly, your birth has to be registered with the registrar and the concerned authorities.

As a Zen practitioner 4 many years and an avid reader, I can reccommend the following: whether u r sitting in a chair or n bed (but completely upright,) the key is 4 ur back to stay straight. This position allows 4 a free flowing of oxygen 2 the lungs and that kind of breathing is just as important in meditation. Ur focus and therefore comprehen will b at there best. In addition, shut out media as any distraction is a negative influence (even unconsciously) to the learning experience. Next b aware of the lighting. Ur eyes need to b comfortable. If u begin 2 loose focus, get up and walk a bit. Let ur mind rest on non academic sights. Hydrate, but save food till it is time 4 that i.e., don't begin ur study either stuffed or hungry. Ur concentration is a learned behavior that most students fail 2 take advantage of- so it can make a difference when the test is finished.

Is this translating into a silly tattoo, or does it really mean whole hearted, focused?","output":"Thanks for A₂A. The phrase 一心不亂 (to use the Traditional Chinese version of 乱) is shared with Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese. It originates from the Buddhist text Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra, translated in Classical Chinese as《佛說阿彌陀經》. The citation from the Classical Chinese text reads: 若有善男子、善女人，聞說阿彌陀佛，執持名號，若一日、若二日、若三日、若四日、若五日、若六日、若七日，一心不亂。 Since you requested for the four (4) words to be translated into Japanese, it is pronounced as isshinfuran. The four words literally translates as “One-Heart-Not-Mess”. That obviously makes little sense when read literally, but translated in context, it means that a person is of a singular (一) mind (心), and not (不) perturbed (亂) by his or her external surroundings. So, if you are going to tattoo those words on your body, I would say that means you are projecting an identity of a person who, by nature, is focussed and unwavering. I hope you do lead your life according to that precept!"},{"instruction":"After playing a fullsized bass guitar all night, does the low weight of a ukulele bass seem appealing?","output":"Well, no. I have a Kala uke bass with rubber strings. The reality is that it is next to impossible to keep the instrument in tune - even though the strings are a good four years old, they still continuously stretch. The lack of playability does not compensate for the low weight. Without playability, weight is irrelevant."},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"Many modern bullets are as sharply pointed as they need to be. Historically, many of the first cartridge firing rifles had tube magazines. Sharply pointed bullets in a tube magazine can cause what is called a “Gang-fire”, where the point is resting against the primer of the cartridge in front of it, and a sudden impact (like dropping the gun) causes the whole magazine to go off. When the change was made to a “Stack” style magazine, bullets with sharper, more aerodynamic points were possible, and indeed started to be used. Now with handguns, the difference is that you want the most power possible in the shortest package. Sharply pointed bullets have to be longer, and take up more space that would be used by the case and powder capacity."},{"instruction":"Are namjoon and rm close?","output":"Well obviously they are close because they are the same person."},{"instruction":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","output":"There was a guy who came to the Sonic I used to work in.

Most people are motivated by money. I guess that is okay. But, the extent some people reach in order to earn that money puzzles me. Hard work is meaningful to some but for others making money via stealing, selling drugs and bribery seems acceptable and part of life. Some even make it as far as taking a life to earn a little cash to then go and spend it on drugs and alcohol again. If you make it a lifestyle to earn money through wrong means, you will never feel the essence of true accomplishment. Money should be earned with respect and hard work, thus giving you ultimate power and independence.Being afraid of criticism. You might be at a distance and someone, somewhere will be criticizing you, and you will never know because you're not there. It's quite obvious isn't it? Clearly, you aren't a psychic or have supernatural abilities, therefore, why are you so afraid of being criticized? If you can't hear someone, does that mean they will stop speaking? Will it always be positive? Think about it. You cannot hear them so you remain unaffected. But, what happens if they confront you with horrible words?

What zoom should I go to for nebulas?","output":"To tell you the truth with typical sky conditions most of the time 300x will show you a blurry view. Three Hundred X is too much magnification for most objects. First of all is your telescope even capable of that much. magnification? The rule of thumb for max magnification is around 30x per inch of aperture. Secondly when I am looking at galaxies and nebulae my magnification will tend to be in the 100X range. For objects like Globular Clusters I will bump up to 200x. For some objects like the Andromeda Galaxy or the Veil Nebula I will go as low as I am capable of since they are so large they cannot fit into the field of view. The only time I would go for maximum magnification which for me is 240X is when atmospheric turbulence is nil, the air is steady and I can look at planets (which is plenty). Lastly you mention “Zoom” Any inexpensive zoom eyepiece is a p.o.s. and suffers from poor images. There are good zooms out there but they go for over 200.

While bananas are slow release energy anyway, having a meal like this 90 minutes before training will aid you in your heavy lifting more than anything. Brown rice is loaded with good carbs, so be sure to eat plenty! One rule for a pre gym meal however is to not fill the plate up too much.

The techniques for playing them are very different. Piano: The keyboard is touch-sensitive. (Organ keyboards aren’t.)There is a sustain pedal. (Organs don’t have one.)The sound decays over time. (Organs stop making sound the instant you release the key.) Implications of these three differences: Because organ keyboards aren’t touch-sensitive, you have to use completely different techniques for controlling volume.Because organs don’t have sustain pedals, you have to keep a key depressed if you want its sound to continue. This fact affects your fingering choices. You may have to use two completely different fingerings to play the exact same piece, depending on whether you’re playing it on a piano or an organ.Adjusted fingerings also mean that organists frequently have to play with their wrists raised higher, and to play with the tips of their fingers on the keys, as illustrated in the photographs below.The fact that the organ immediately stops making sound when you release the key means that organists have to pay just as much attention to the release of the key as they do to its attack. Pianists, by contrast, pay a lot more attention to attack than to release. Organ: There is more than one keyboard.There is a pedalboard for your feet.The primary volume control is a foot pedal.

These platforms compile public information from various sources and may provide you with the name associated with the mobile number. Note that the accuracy and availability of results can vary.Social Media Search: Enter the mobile number into social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or Instagram search bars. If the person has associated their mobile number with their account and set it to be visible, you may find their profile and obtain their name.Contact the Service Provider: If you have a valid reason and need to trace someone's name, you can contact the mobile service provider and explain the situation. They may ask for proper documentation or a legal reason to disclose personal information. This method is typically used in cases of legal or law enforcement involvement.

These are based on my personal experiences and may or may not work out for you. Use this opportunities to explore new areas and learn new technologies. For example if you know Django, try out NodeJS. Most of the major projects are not performance critical and you’ll only be working on a prototype. So you have more freedom while choosing the tech stackMake a small viable prototype very quickly and then focus on incremental development.Follow at least basics of industry standard software development principles. Write test cases for your code. Ensure good test coverage. Write well commented and legible code. Use linters. Document all your work.If you plan on publishing a paper, then start early. Most students have too much on their plate during the last few weeks. They usually do not get time to write papers.Read about existing work in this year. Try to improvise the existing stuff add additional features. Most of the time it’s not worth building a web app from scratch that is a minified version of an existing product. To put it simply, social network, hotel management, library management, etc are bad projects. They are too generic. You can do betterCollaborate with your team members. Everyone should code. Use a version control system, build system, dependency manager, etc. These tools will improve your productivity which is important in year-long projects like this.Spend a lot of time on planning and deciding architecture for your application. If you’re working on a purely research project, spend a lot of time on literature survey and deciding your problem statement. Sometimes you end up putting a lot of effort in solving problems which were out of the original scope.Meet with your mentor(s) regularly. Update them regarding your progress. Take inputs from from them.

Civil aircraft are a bit out of my area of knowledge but it is a good question and so I did some research. It appears that it may come down to two things: Availability of a suitable enginePerformance Engine development is very expensive and business jets is a relatively small and risky market to develop an engine specifically for. So historically business jets had to rely on military jet engine derivatives that were lower bypass ratios. Modern civil jets appear to be able to take advantage of higher bypass engines used by smaller commercial jets. For performance - high bypass engines are most efficient at low speeds and higher air pressure which is needed for takeoff. But they have worse performance at higher speeds and altitudes. I looked at two of the most popular planes currently in production: The Bombardier Challenger 850 and the Gulfstream G650. Challenger 650 [Photo: Maarten Visser] The CL-650 has a max takeoff weight around 99,600 lb (45,200 kg). It has a cruise speed of Mach .8 and a max speed of Mach .85. It’s service ceiling is 41,000 ft. CL-850 comes with GE [LINKED_TEXT: CF34] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/General_Electric_CF34]-3B [LINKED_TEXT: turbofans] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Turbofan], 38.84 kN (8,730 lbf) thrust each. It is a high bypass with a ratio of 6.2:1. These engines are used on Bombardier and Embraer regional jets. Gulfstream 650 [Photo: Eddie Maloney] The G650 has a max takeoff weight around 100,000 lbs and cruising speed of Mach .85-.90 and a service ceiling of 51,000 ft. It is powered by two BR 725 with 16,900 lbf (75.2 kN). This engine is also used by the Boeing 717 (formerly MD-95). The BR725 has a bypass ratio of 4.2:1. what I find interesting is these two planes are the same weight, but the G650 with the higher cruise speed and operating ceiling has engines with almost twice the thrust and lower bypass ratio. It also appears that the newer designs are using higher bypass engines when available.

It is advisable to consider factors such as taste, menu options, nutritional value, and convenience when making a choice. It may also be helpful to consider any dietary restrictions or specific preferences you have. Both fast-food chains have their own strengths and cater to different palates, so it may be worth trying both to see which one aligns better with your preferences."},{"instruction":"What exercise can lose face fat?","output":"Losing general body weight and performing specific activities that tighten the facial muscles are necessary to reduce face fat. Despite the fact that spot reduction is not an option, the following advice can help you get a more toned and thinner face: Weight loss overall: Follow a healthy diet and consistent exercise regimen to encourage weight loss all over your body, including your face. This will assist in reducing body fat overall, including facial fat.Calorie deficit: Achieve one by taking in fewer calories than you expend. Ensure that your diet is lean, balanced, and composed of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Reduce your consumption of high-calorie snacks, sugary drinks, and processed foods.Water is essential for maintaining hydration. Water can aid in toxin removal and bloating reduction, both of which can lessen the look of puffiness.Exercises for the face should be performed to assist tone and strengthen the muscles there. Cheek lifts, jawline lifts, and chin lifts are a few examples of these workouts. Regularly carrying out these workouts could help your face seem better.activities that burn body fat across the entire body: Include cardiovascular activities in your program. Exercises that burn more calories than you consume, such as jogging, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking, can aid in weight loss.Regularly massaging your face can improve the appearance of your face, increase blood flow, and minimize fluid retention. Apply a moisturizer or face oil using upward strokes and soft circular motions.Limit your sodium intake because it might cause bloating and water retention. To help reduce facial bloating, cut less on processed snacks and salty foods.Get enough rest: Sleep deprivation can lead to fluid retention and facial puffiness. To preserve general health and lessen facial bloating, aim for 7-9 hours of good sleep each night. Remember, everyone's body is unique, and the way fat is distributed varies from person to person. It's essential to focus on overall health and well-being rather than solely targeting face fat. If you have concerns about your weight or facial appearance, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who can provide personalized advice based on your specific needs."},{"instruction":"What does the British word bint refer to?","output":"It means woman, bird, young lady."},{"instruction":"Will Akhilesh Yadav be able to form his government this time in the Uttar Pradesh 2022 elections?","output":"Ground realities don't suggest SP forming Government in 2022.

Dad had traveled to a lot of non-tourist type places in his career as a research geophysicist, such as Burundi and Uganda and Iran and Suriname. Even in places that do have a lot of tourism, he was usually out in the very rural areas, almost never near a large city. When he traveled to the Fiji Islands, it wasn't a tourist hot spot! I learned a lot of world geography just through letters to and from him. He was an exceptionally bright man and an incredible husband to my mom and father to me. For a few weeks in the hospital, he was convinced that he was in an airport waiting to fly back to the US. He told me that he needed me to bring a jacket for him to get into a cab and go back home to Mom. He was aware enough that I was living with my own husband and daughters in another state, but had forgotten that Mom had passed away nearly 30 years earlier and the house had been sold when he went into assisted living near me. Then he went into rehab, and somehow became convinced that he was in a prison in Iraq and was being tortured. (Gentle, and I do mean GENTLE, physical therapy was extremely painful for him at that point.) He asked me to bring a blanket, throw it over him in a wheelchair, tell people he was an Iraqi shepherd being returned to his village, and smuggle him out. The best way I could find to calm him down was to tell him I was working on an escape plan. And no, to the best of my knowledge he was never incarcerated in any country, including the U.S.! I can laugh about it now… I honestly have NO idea how he came up with that particular delusion. Dad's been gone for over 2 years now, and he's very deeply missed.

For Klobuchar and Buttigieg: This will largely come to their positions with minority voters, which is a critical part of the Democratic Party’s electoral strategy and has been for the past few elections. For example in 2008 Obama lost the White vote, but won the Black vote by a wide enough margin that the votes he got from Whites put him over John McCain. The same was essentially done in 2012 against Mitt Romney. Romney won the White vote but lost the minority votes and lost them by a wide margin. This has meant that in national elections, Democratic candidates need to be able to show an appeal to minority voters. And that was something that neither Klobuchar or Buttigieg really managed. They did relatively well in Iowa and New Hampshire, but these are states that have very few minority voters, and at the same time, Joe Biden didn’t do particularly well in either. In fact Biden was practically absent in New Hampshire. This raised the possibility for Buttigieg and Klobuchar that part of the reason why they weren’t getting much attention is that both have come out of parts of the country where they’re not going to get a lot of “free press.” Buttigieg was the Mayor of South Bend and Klobuchar is the Senator from Minnesota. No one outside of those areas really knew who they were and both used the primary debates as a means of introduction to the nation, and with Biden slumping, there was the theoretical option of climbing into the race against Sanders. Then came South Carolina where Biden won every county by a wide margin and the best that Buttigieg managed to climb was 3rd place in some of those counties behind Sanders and neither he nor Klobuchar gained any delegates in the state. Thus as the primaries move into a host of states where large portions of these states are going to have minority votes that will need to be won… after such a poor performance, it would be unlikely that they’re going to get any major influx of minority support when they hadn’t gained much of any over the course of the campaign. And since I don’t think there are any more primary debates scheduled, there won’t be much more “free advertising” to get their message out there. Thus with no attention from a critical voting block that the Democrats rely on and no more opportunities to get their opinions out there to convince anyone… it is actually smart on their party to back out, as while Biden may be just as poor as they are… he’s also gotten a larger share of the minority vote which will give him a better shot against Sanders if he’s not having to fend off attacks from other Center-Left Democrats. For Steyer: It will relate to financial issues. Unlike most of the other candidates who is strapped for cash, Steyer is independently wealthy and has funded things for a fair number of progressive causes, even before the 2020 election campaign. He had television ads out urging impeachment over the Russia collusion issue in 2017 at a point where he was not a candidate for public office. That shows that he has the money to stay in the campaign if he wants to. He could be like Bloomberg and simply buy ad time and hope to buy an election. And at the same time, going into South Carolina, he polled fairly well with minority voters going into that primary election… He didn’t do as well as Biden did, but he did much better than Klobuchar or Buttigieg. Thus one would have thought that he had a chance going into the South Carolina primary… particularly when Biden was so absent in Iowa and New Hampshire. That he could use his wealth to buy attention and build up support with minority voters to try and keep pace with Sanders… possibly hoping that Warren will start eating into his voters in other states. And then came South Carolina… again where Biden won every county and the best Steyer did was 3rd in some counties… In this, it’s demonstrated to Steyer that while he could pay to get his name and his opinion out there… and that did a lot to show his support for the African American community… the Democratic voting base is not one that is going to just vote for someone because they have a lot of money. Elections still cost money, and that’s actually killed a lot of the Democratic contenders’ campaigns already. But the Democratic voter likely isn’t going to just go for someone because he or she is rich. Biden, who’s campaign is largely broke finished ahead in South Carolina by a wide margin. Sanders finished second, and while Sanders has raised a lot of contributions, these have all been small scale contributions and he’s gotten enough of them to afford what ads he needs… thus Steyer was rejected because they didn’t want to feel like their votes were bought by someone… And South Carolina was Steyer’s best showing as he didn’t finish close in any of the other primaries thus far. And if 3rd place is the election with 0 delegates awarded is the best he can do… it’s likely that there won’t be a winnable formula going forward and better to back someone like Biden than try to directly to buy attention or ad space… if that’s what Steyer chooses to do."},{"instruction":"Do you think J&K people do not consider themselves as Indian citizens?","output":"I don't think so but don't say Jk because he is with V has Jimin always after him."},{"instruction":"Why has indexed shifting displaced traditional friction shifting on bicycles?","output":"Why has indexed shifting displaced traditional friction shifting (derailleur, shifter, bicycles)? I own both vintage friction shift bikes and a modern indexed shifting bikes, raced and toured during the friction shifting era and continue to put thousands of miles a year on my bikes. Based on this background I can give you two main reasons for why this happened: When racing, a missed shift (i.e. shifting to the gap between two gears where the chain would just slide over the cogs instead of engaging in a cog) or an incorrect shift into the wrong gear could lose you the race, especially in situations like end of race sprints where split seconds counted and multiple accurate shifts were needed due to the acceleration needed at that point in the race. Index shifting (and then later shifters integrated into the brake levers) made those bad shifts a thing of the past and were a huge advantage in a sprint. Racers could not afford to stay with friction and still have a chance of winning.Many Americans who bought bikes during the ’70s to early ’80s bike boom were intimidated by the mechanical parts of bicycles, much as how many americans are intimidated by cars with manual transmissions. Especially intimidating were missed shift situations as discussed above. The loud click and tactile feedback of an indexed system was much more reassuring than the more subtle shift-then-trim-shifter-to-reduce-noise friction shifting method. This is why people flocked to Shimano’s SIS system that appeared in the early 1980s. The very first point I made above regarding shifting to the gap between gears became a nonexistent problem after 6- and 7-speed freewheels and cassettes with shifting ramps became the norm, simply because the cogs were spaced more closely and the ramps made sure that shifts were completed. A significant downside to index shifting is that bikes now need “tune ups” to adjust for cable stretch that results in the index shifting not indexing properly. There’s really no need to tune up a friction shift derailleur unless you crash and bend something or change drivetrain parts."},{"instruction":"Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?","output":"The psychology is interesting. \\"Speaking of Psychology: Why people believe in conspiracy theories, with Karen Douglas, PhD\\" [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/conspiracy-theories] [URL: https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/conspiracy-theories]"},{"instruction":"Social Science","output":"How Satan Uses Science to Corrupt Man What is science? Isn’t science held in high prestige and considered profound in just about everyone’s mind? (Yes, it is.) When science is mentioned, don’t people feel, “This is something regular folks can’t grasp, this is a topic that only scientific researchers or experts can touch upon. It doesn’t have any connection with us regular folks”? Does it have a connection though? (Yes.) How does Satan use science to corrupt people? We won’t talk about other things except the things that people frequently encounter in their own lives. You have heard of genes, right? (Yes.) You are all familiar with this term, right? Were genes discovered through science? What exactly do genes mean to people? Don’t they make people feel that the body is a mysterious thing? When people are introduced to this topic, won’t there be people—especially the curious—who will want to know more or want more details? These curious people will focus their energy on this subject and when they aren’t busy they will look up information in books and on the internet to learn more details about it. What is science? To speak plainly, science is the thoughts and theories of things man is curious about, things that are unknown, and not told to them by [LINKED_TEXT: God] [URL: https://www.holyspiritspeaks.org/god-himself-the-unique-v/]; science is the thoughts and theories of the mysteries man wants to explore. What do you think the scope of science is? You could say that it encapsulates all things, but how does man do the work of science? Is it through research? It involves researching the details and the laws of these things and then putting forth dubious theories about which everyone thinks, “These scientists are really terrific! They know so much and have so much knowledge to understand these things!” They have so much admiration for those people, right? People that research science, what sort of views do they hold? Don’t they want to research the universe, to research the mysterious things in their area of interest? What is the final outcome of this? Some sciences have people drawing their conclusions by conjectures, others have people relying on human experience for their conclusions and yet another field of sciences will have people coming to their conclusions based on experience or historical and background observations. Is that right? (Yes.) So what does science do for people? What science does is that it only allows people to see the objects in the physical world and merely satisfies man’s curiosity; it does not allow man to see the laws by which God has dominion over all things. Man seems to find answers from science, but those answers are puzzling and bring only temporary satisfaction, a satisfaction that only serves to confine the heart of man to the physical world. Man feels that they have already gotten the answers from science so whatever issue arises, they firmly believe in their scientific views to prove or accept it. Man’s heart becomes possessed by science and seduced by it to the point where man no longer has the mind to know God, worship God, and believe that all things come from God and man should look to Him for answers. Isn’t this true? You can see that the more a person believes in science, the more absurd they become, believing that everything has a scientific solution, that research can solve anything. They do not seek God and they do not believe He exists; even some people who have followed God for many years will go and research bacteria on a whim or look up some information for answers. Such a person does not look at the issues from the perspective of truth and in most cases they want to rely on scientific views and knowledge or scientific answers to solve problems; but they don’t rely on God and they do not seek God. Do people like this have God in their hearts? (No.) There are even some people who want to research God in the same way as they study science. For example, there are many religious experts who have gone to where the ark came to rest after the great flood. They have seen the ark, but in the appearance of the ark they do not see the existence of God. They only believe in the stories and the history and this is the result of their scientific research and study of the physical world. If you research material things, whether it be microbiology, astronomy, or geography, you will never find a result that says God exists or that He has dominion over all things. Is this right? (Yes.) So what does science do for man? Doesn’t it distance man from God? Isn’t this allowing people to study [LINKED_TEXT: God] [URL: https://hi.godfootsteps.org/about-us.html]? Doesn’t this make people more doubtful about God’s existence? (Yes.) So how does Satan want to use science to corrupt man? Doesn’t Satan want to use scientific conclusions to deceive and benumb people? Satan uses the ambiguous answers to hold on to people’s hearts so that they won’t seek out or believe in God’s existence, and thus they will be suspicious of God, deny God and be distanced from Him. So this is why we say it is one of the ways Satan corrupts people."},{"instruction":"w will humans look in 1000 years?","output":"Pretty much exactly the same as we do now.

Sugar is not an essential nutrient but contributes 4 calories per gram. Other carbohydrates, like those found in fruits and vegetables contribute calories but also nutrients with those calories. Sugar is a disaccharide and so breaks down into half glucose and half fructose. Excess amounts of fructose contribute to fatty liver, otherwise is converted into liver glycogen and stored until needed. Excess glucose is eventually converted into liver/muscle glycogen and used when needed. Since skeletal muscles make up more storage tissue than the liver, they are capable of storing about 400 grams of glycogen whereas the liver stores about 100 grams. When those tissues become saturated with glycogen, the excess is stored as fat. Another problem with excess glucose or sugar is that a significant percentage of people are predisposed to diabetes and their insulin sensitivity decreases which, if this process is repeated often enough and for years, requires more insulin to do the same work as before. This can increase until the insulin barely does anything and blood glucose rises to dangerous levels. High blood glucose levels damage small blood vessels and damage some vital organs and other tissues such as nerves and your eyes. High glucose also glycates LDL particles which transport cholesterol and triglycerides to where needed. When LDL particles are glycated, they convert to small dense LDL particles that are not utilized similarly and can cause an increase in atherosclerosis (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). These are just a few reasons to reduce or discontinue adding sugar to your food/beverages. Manufactured sugar wasn’t around until hundred or so years of human history. Before that we got our needed glucose from fruits and/or vegetables, which have fiber to slow absorption and the fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria. Since humans are omnivores, they can get nutrition from either meats or vegetables. Glucose can also be created from protein sources via a process known as gluconeogenesis. Sugar is very profitable for manufacturers and makes many foods and beverages taste better but too much is not good and most people don’t know when to reduce their intake of sugar. For many, sugar is addictive, many people find it very difficult to discontinue eating sugary desserts and beverages. Like people that discover too much alcohol is bad for their health, they discover too much sugar is bad for their health, and have difficulty controling their intake. For some it is better to wean themselves or stop completely, that is when they discover how dependent they’ve become on sugar and how pervasive sugar is in all the foods and beverages such as found in their favorite grocery stores and convenience stores. Too much sugar in the diet also contributes to causing unneccesary inflammation throughtout the body. If you know someone you suspect of eating too much sugar or carbohydrates, notice how puffy their skin is. That’s not just subcutaneous fat but some inflammation occuring. If they have a sibling that is more health conscience and has a healthier diet, that sibling probably has a better skin tone and texture and probably less inflammation. Given enough time, I could probably find more reasons to avoid sugar, more specifically excess added refined sugar, but hopefully the previous is more than enough."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"Here’s an experiment that might help you understand this. Go to your local hardware store and find the biggest sledge hammer they carry. It’ll probably be a 20lb hammer, now take this hammer and set it on your foot. A little uncomfortable, but otherwise, not too bad right? Now pick the head of this hammer up to about shoulder height and drop it on your foot. What, you say you’re not going to do that? That it would hurt remarkably? That it could break your foot? Most of us have some understanding that objects falling cause a lot of pain if they land on us, even if they were objects that we could normally rest on our bodies without any harm. An object that falls from a 1 story height will exert about seven and a half times it’s resting weight in force on the first object it hits. That’s why a dropped object will sink into soft ground the same as if it had been stepped on. The top quarter of the WTC buildings fell almost two stories before they hit an intact floor. For the fraction of a second that each floor resisted, the floor was effectively trying to support the force of several buildings put on top of them. It would only take a few floors falling before no floor in it’s way could resist it. The design, flexible and beautiful as it was, was not one that could arrest a large collapse once it had started. Each floor was broken away from the columns, the columns themselves buckled under the immense force, and whatever was left standing was standing alone, unsupported. The remaining core columns, unsupported, tipped over within seconds.

Very frequently the ET is the last step before discharging the water into the sewer or local waterways. Without this tank it is impossible to bring severe pH conditions into safe compliance. At other times, an ET is not needed as the wastewater process just happens to discharge neutral water. Other wastewater might be very close to neutral and only need a minor adjustment. In those cases a non-chemical adjustment is possible using a gravity operated tank with replaceable media. Passing the water through crushed limestone chips, also called calcite can help raise slightly acidic to neutral. For slightly alkaline water weak acid cation exchanger can lower the pH to neutral. The shortcoming of using a non-chemical pH adjustment is that they don’t come with controls, recorders and meters, and are at times hard to regulate and keep consistent."},{"instruction":"What are the arguments for and against whether a human fertilized egg at the moment of conception is a person or not?","output":"A fertilized egg can divide and produce genetically identical but consciously distinct identical siblings.

Dont tell your weakpoint to anyone. When you tell it,It means that you are dependent on them for some reason 4. Do not have much expectations from others. If you wanna expect,then expect from yourself. 5. Help people but do not hope for the help in return. 6. Don't mug up everything in your life.

What will be the consequences?","output":"First of all, let me clarify that the currency value of a country doesn't necessarily mean the strength of that economy. If that were to be the case, then the Bangladeshi economy would've been stronger than the Japaneseeconomy as 1 Bangladeshi Taka is equal to 1.4 Japanese Yen. Now let's envision what would have happened if 1 rupee equals to 1 dollar, w.r.t. the India, Pros of the situation:1) First of all buying goods will be cheaper as the price of imports will be cheaper.2)Buying luxury goods will also be cheaper - you can easily buy an I-Phone 7 for Rs.542!3) As imports would be cheaper, this would reduce the price of petrol and diesel, leading to low transportation costs. Cons of the situation:But on the other side of the coin, the story is totally different.1) Exports will fall, as they'll become expensive and why would any country buy our products if they can get it through other countries at a cheaper rate.2) There will also be a decrease in foreign investment as investing in our country will become expensive as compared to other countries. One of the main reasons why foreign countries invest in India is because of the cheap price.3) Also, the unemployment rate will go up, as few would hire an Indian at Rs.75,000 if they can get an outsider at 3000.4) Many companies will move out of India as their expenses will be high, and their businesses non-profitable.5) Even your maid, with a salary of, say Rs.4,000 can buy seven I-Phone 7! This can be clearly seen that if 1 rupee would've been equal to 1 dollar, there would've been a high unemployment rate and a slower economic growth, because of lesser foreign investment. Thus, the situation of a rupee being equal to a dollar is not affordable for a growing and a developing economy like India. A similar situation occurred in 2007-08 when 1 dollar was equal to about Rs 41. At that time, imports of the country was good, but the exports and the IT sector got affected a lot. INR vs. US in 2011-12Source: Google Now you will say what if we buy swadeshi (domestic) products only and boycott foreign goods.This situation would also not work, as it was a regular practice till 1990 when we used to use our own products. Since then, however, our economy has grown manifold, and if we boycott the goods of other nations, they may also boycott Indian goods! Another developing nation, China, has adopted the fixed exchange rate system, in which they decide the value of their currency with respect to the U.S. dollar, and whenever they want to increase their exports, they just depreciate the value of their currency (Yuan). The value of the INR from 1 in 1947 to 61 in 2014 to over 65 today! (w.r.t. the US) The falling value of the rupee (up to a certain extent) doesn't worry our Finance Minister and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor. They are more worried about the fluctuations of the rupee. If the value of the rupee yesterday was 60 and 70 today, there is too much fluctuations in the currency, which will have an adverse effect on the stability of the Indian economy. India has adopted the floating exchange rate system (since 1975). In the floating system, the value of the currency can't be determined by the RBI Governor, the Finance Minister or the government, it is determined by the currency demand & supply that prevails in the market. But still, the Finance Minister has some control over policy and foreign reserves, through which he tries to maintain a constant value of the rupee, by controlling the inflation rate, and in the process, prevents the currency from getting completely destroyed. Now lets come to reality, today 1 dollar is more than 65 rupees. As Indians, we do want our currency to be at a higher rate but at what cost? The cost of it, at this point in time, is too high (higher unemployment, lower economic growth and lower foreign investment). We can challenge the dollar later but first let our economy grow and don't forget what I mentioned above- cost of currency does not necessarily signify the strength of an economy."},{"instruction":"w can I pass my German B1 exam? What do I do for that?","output":"The B1 level in german language is an intermediate level. It holds great importance and relevance when it comes to the career prospects. To excel in B1 level german, one needs complete focus and interest. That’s the basic requirement while learning the language. You need to give 2-3 hours daily to german if you plan to appear for the Goethe exams. Most of the grammar of german language is covered in the initial levels and B1 is all about using the grammar in the best way possible. You have to be able to form small paragraphs and explain your opinion about a particular thing. B1 level enables you to convey most of the things that are covered in our day to day life. In order to pass the exam, it’s essential you are focussed. You should have all the grammar concepts on tips so that you can convey yourself in a better manner in the speaking test. A strong grammar and vocabulary sense would also mean a good written test. So, this way, your two modules (schreiben and sprechen) get covered up. Another important selection that you have to do is between the various options for learning language. There are many options in Delhi like Oracle, Inlingua, Rcare (no.01147940068), Language Pantheon etc. . If you are not from Delhi, then you can select any Goethe centre. You should form a dictionary of your own according to your preference of words. That helps too. For the reading section, it’s important again that you are aware of the difficult words in german. You have to make a collective sense of the words in the text and solve acoordingly. To refine your hearing skills for the german hearing test, you should watch movies and series in the german language.

Pick Your Blog Name and Platform The biggest mistake beginners make when building a blog is choosing the wrong blogging platform Thankfully you asked this question so you won’t be making that mistake. For 95% of users, it makes more sense to use Blog Tool Publishing Platform, and CMS — also known as self-hosted WordPress. That’s because WordPress is open source which means it is 100% free to use. You can install plugins, customize your blog design, and most importantly make money from your blog without any restriction. WordPress is also the number one website platform used by all successful blogs including our own. To put in perspective, [LINKED_TEXT: 43% of all websites] [URL: https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/ultimate-list-of-wordpress-stats-facts-and-other-research/] on the internet use WordPress! Now you might be wondering why is wordpress free? What’s the catch? There’s no catch. It’s free because you have to do the setup and host it yourself. In other words, you will need a domain name and web hosting. A domain name is what people type to get to your website. It’s your blog’s address on the internet. Think Amazon or Google. Web hosting is where your website files live. It’s your website’s house on the internet. Every blog needs web hosting. A new domain name typically costs around 14.99 / year, and web hosting plans normally costs 7.99 / month. That’s a lot of money for beginners who are just starting out. Thankfully, Bluehost , an official WordPress recommended hosting provider, has agreed to offer our users a free domain name and over 50% off on web hosting. You can also use other popular WordPress hosting companies like Siteground or Hostinger, and still be able to follow our blog setup tutorial. We recommend Bluehost for beginners because it is one of the oldest web hosting companies on the internet. They are also the largest brand name when it comes to WordPress hosting because they host millions of websites including many of our own.

Let’s go ahead and purchase your domain + hosting. Open up Bluehost in a new window and follow along. First thing you need to do is click on the green Get Started Now button to get started. On the next screen, select the plan that you need (basic and plus are the most popular). After that, you will be asked to enter the domain name for your website(Domain name) Lastly, you will need to add your account information and finalize the package info to complete the process. We recommend going with the 12 or 24-month plan because that’s the best value. On this screen, you will see optional extras that you can purchase. It’s entirely up to you whether or not you purchase these, but we generally don’t recommend purchasing them right away. You can always add them later on, if you decide that you need them. Once completed, you will receive an email with details on how to login to your web hosting control panel (cPanel). This is where you manage everything from support, emails, among other things. But most importantly, this is where you install WordPress. Step 2. Install WordPress Blogging Software When you signup with Bluehost , they will automatically install WordPress for you, so you can start building your blog right away. Simply login to your Bluehost account, and then click the Login to WordPress button to get started. You can also login to WordPress by going to http//[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: http://your/]yoursite / wp-admin/ directly from your browser. Although most of the above blog hosting companies are now also automatically installing WordPress to help non-techy users kickstart their blogging journey. Once WordPress is setup, you’re ready to create your blog pages, customize your blog’s design, and start blogging. Step 3. Selecting Your WordPress Theme The visual appearance of your WordPress blog is controlled by blog themes. When you first visit your blog, it will look something like this: This is not very appealing to most people. Customizing the look and feel of your blog is by far one of the most exciting and rewarding part in the journey of creating your WordPress blog. There are thousands of pre-made wordpress themes that you can install on your site. Some of them are free themes, while others are paid premium themes. You can change your theme by going to your WordPress dashboard and clicking on Appearance » Themes. Go ahead and click on the Add New button. On the next screen, you will able to search from 10000+ Wordpress themes free that are available in the official Blog Tool Publishing Platform and CMS WordPress.org themes directory. You can sort by popular, latest, featured, as well as other feature filters (i.e industry, layout, etc). You can take your mouse over to a new theme, and you will see a Preview button. Clicking on it will open the theme preview where you can see how the design would look on your website. The preview of your theme may not look exactly as shown in the screenshot, which is normal as you will get to customize and set it up later. What you need to look for is design, colors, typography, and other elements. The best tip to select the perfect WordPress theme is to strive for simplicity in design. It helps you keep things clean and clear while offering a good experience to your users. When you have found the theme that you like, simply bring your mouse on it, and it will show the Install button. Click on it and wait for the theme to be installed. After that, the install button will be replaced with an Activate button. You need to click on it to Activate the theme. Once you have installed your theme, you can customize it by clicking on the Customize link under the Appearance menu. Depending on the theme you choose, there will be built-in widgets and customization options that lets you tweak your blog design. You can get even more design control with a WordPress Page Builder like Elementor or Divi which let you create a custom header, footer, sidebar, and more without writing any HTML code. These plugins give you more design control than what you get with Wix or Squarespace, while giving you the full freedom of the powerful WordPress content management system. Once you have selected your WordPress theme, you are now ready to create your first blog post. Step 4. Creating Your First Blog Post To write your first blog post, click on the Posts » Add New menu in your WordPress dashboard. You will see an editor area where you can write your first blog post. WordPress uses a block-based editor that allows you to create beautiful content layouts for your blog post. Once you’re done writing, go ahead and click on the Publish button on the top-right corner of the screen to make your blog post publicly available. On the posts screen, you will notice several other sections such as Categories and Tags. You can use these to organize your blog posts into sections. Step 5. Plugins & Customizations Once you have written your first blog post, you probably want to get started with adding other usual elements on your website such as contact page, galleries, sliders, email list, forums, etc. To add all these additional features, you need to use plugins. Wordpress Plugins are apps that allow you to add new features to your website (without writing any code). There are over 60,000 WordPress plugins available in the free WordPress plugin directory alone. This means no matter what you want to accomplish, there is a plugin for it. That being said, let’s take a look at how to use plugins to add some essential features to your WordPress blog.

One fateful night, we were a group of three non vegetarians and three pure vegetarians in a restaurant famous for it’s meat dishes. As you can imagine, half of us were really disappointed. Add to that a really picky five year old and it's guaranteed to be a bad meal. When we reached there, we didn't get service for a long time. One of the people with us started getting really haughty about it when a waiter who was already waiting another table spotted us and ushered us in to fit us somewhere. He changed the dish specifications in the end when he'd already brought out the food, cleaned the table because the cleaning staff was busy, helped the little picky brat eat and got us extra gravy, even though they don't offer extra portions (he said he understands how dumb it is to order an entire dish for just a tiny bit of gravy). All while waiting another table. The best part was the dessert. We ordered something called khubani ka meetha (pictured) which was supposed to be delicious, but to our (maybe unaccustomed?) tongues, it felt absolutely horrid. It was extremely sweet, unbearable to even us proud-of-my-sweet-tooth people, it was so sweet that it was actually bitter. We asked our waiter if it was supposed to taste like cough syrup (the tone the picky eater kid's dad used wasn't nice however) and the waiter just smiled and very nicely said, “how'd you know Sir? That's what we use to make it!” Even though we had a good laugh and that guy with us calmed down, we wanted to return it even if we couldn't get our money back (we were told that's how sweet it is supposed to be). The waiter saw our issue, he got us ice cream, he mixed it for us properly himself and fed the picky eater's picky dad like he was a little kid and made everybody smile with this little spectacle. It was bearable at last. We left a tip that was almost the same value as the bill itself because the picky dad's company was taking care of the bill but tips were on us, and he really did know how to make the picky dad happy, something we all failed at during that trip."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"In Today’s Mobile World, a mobile application is not only a Customer engagement tool; rather it is providing Nemours benefits beyond its role.

Rotten teeth are a big cause of bad breath in dogs. Gingivitis This again can contribute to bad breath. The way to find out if your dog has Gingivitis or not is to take a good look at the dog's gums and see if there are any signs of them being swollen, sore, bright red in colour or shiny. Diet Diet is known to play a part in dog bad breath causes. Avoid canned foods as they tend to form plaque very quickly. The best form of food for dogs with bad breath is raw food or dried food. Here is a [LINKED_TEXT: best homemade dog recipes] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bED5H2iYqSg] that I recommend Eating Their Own Waste Dogs are known to eat their own waste and even other animal's waste as well. This happens normally when there is vitamin deficiency in their diet. Keep an eye out on what your dog is doing when they are out and about. Kidney Problems Dogs with kidney problems are known to have really bad breath, however the irony is that dog's with kidney problems can lose up to 70% of the function of their kidney's before showing any clinical signs of kidney disease. Oral Hygiene This is the most common reason for your dog to have bad breath. You see, dogs tend to collect bacteria, germs, plaque just like humans do, obviously we brush our teeth regularly and they don't. So over a period of time there might have been a plaque build up which is causing the breath to stink. My all time favorite is [LINKED_TEXT: Premium Pet Dental Spray] [URL: http://www.best-online-solution.com/dog-bad-breath]. The spray removes plaque and tartar and reduces the risk of oral disease for pets by applying its antiseptic properties. It instantly cures your pet’s bad breath with the powerful breath freshener. Dogs love this dental taste of the spray and like begging it for every day. Anal Glands Dogs normally clean their anal glands by dragging themselves on rugs, carpets etc. However if there is only laminate flooring around the house it becomes difficult for them to clean, so will eventually cause bad breath as they will start licking themselves. Baby Teeth When younger dogs shed their baby teeth that can lead to them drooling and having bad breath."},{"instruction":"Who is the most powerful Marvel character in MCU?","output":"Vulcan Gabriel Summers is our twentieth most powerful character within the Marvel universe. He’s a mutant who goes by the name of Vulcan, who was once the Emperor of the Shi’ar Empire. He’s gone to battle against Starjammers, Inhumans, and X-men at the same time. We’re impressed with his ability to control a total of seven elements, including water, wind, fire, earth and three additional ones beyond the norm, of electricity, darkness, and light Skaar Skaar is the son of the Hulk. His father was one of the strongest characters, but the strength of Skaar even surpasses that of the hulk in an alternate reality. He can fall from outer space with a healing factor that goes beyond that of the great Wolverine. He’s one of the strongest characters in the Marvel Universe, and he’s really hard to kill, but we’ve kept him outside of the top ten because aside from these two amazing powers, there isn’t a lot more to say about him. Odin Odin is the patriarch of the mighty Thor, and he rises to the top in strength among all of the Asgardians. Odin is an immortal who commands control over magic and he can produce a variety of different effects. One of the best powers to his credit is the ability to augment his already great powers by absorbing the powers which exist collectively within the rest of the Asgardians. Hercules Hercules, like Skaar, is also stronger than the Hulk and Thor. He’s the son of the immortal Zeus who accomplished the feat of hauling the island of Manhattan into a different location. Now that’s some serious strength. He’s also one of the hardiest Marvel characters who have the ability to survive in outer space without any outside assistance, and he can also survive through a cosmic Nova blast, giving him an edge over scar when it comes to power. Galactus Galactus is the fifteenth most powerful Marvel character because he can literally eat planets. His cosmic knowledge and power are unlimited. This gives him a definite edge over many of the other characters in our top 20 list. What we think is really cool about Galactus is his use of technology that is paired with the biology of his existence. He influences the minds of those who are looking at him and they see him in the same form that they occupy, whether alien, human or otherwise. Magus Magus is the father of Adam Warlock who has a power that is right up to par with that of Galactus. Magus is also an immortal, but we ascribe a bit more power to him than that of [LINKED_TEXT: Galactus because Magus can teleport] [URL: https://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/15-most-powerful-characters-in-the-marvel-universe/], shapeshift and turn himself into any substance. In addition to this, he can split an entire star into two piece Adam Warlock Adam Warlock is the son of Magus and he was created to be a perfect example of a human being. He outdoes his father by having the energy to project along with the speed and strength of Magus on steroids. In addition to this, he can stand up against reality-warping and even Time Gem’s freezing ability is something he can resist. He also has the amazing ability to discern where there’s a wormhole and he can also create them. Amatsu Mikaboshi This character has been rightly nicknamed the Chaos King. He has enough power to destroy an entire world. While his physical strength is outmatched by many of the other Marvel characters and deities, his magical powers are top-notch, adn so is his durability. He has the power to affect the astral bodies of people who have recently died, and he can capture and detail their essence at will. Surtur Surtur can be compared to Odin in his degree of superhuman strength, but we think that it goes a little beyond that. He’s a humungous fire demon who commands the power of a thousand suns.[LINKED_TEXT: He is an immortal] [URL: https://list25.com/25-most-powerful-marvel-characters/] who also has the gifts of telekinesis, pyrokinesis and he can survive while living in a flame. Cyttorak Cyttorak is a deity who is among the most powerful of all Marvel magical beings. He is an omnipotent being who exists within his Crimson Cosmos and he is also the source of many elite magicians within the universe. He is also the source for Doctor Strange. Franklin Richards Reed Richards and Sue Storm had a son whom they named Franklin Richards. He’s a mutant who is classified as a rare and omega-level character. His most powerful characteristic is that he can warp reality as well as control the fundamental forces of the universe. He is one of the strongest mutants in existence with powers equal to that of the Celestials. Eternity Eternity is Infinity’s twin brother as well as being the sibling of Oblivion and Death. Eternity is more powerful than the mighty Galactus. Eternity has the ability to manipulate reality, as well as space and time. This definitely gives Eternity an edge over the Marvel characters who do not possess these abilities, [LINKED_TEXT: nor the power to resist] [URL: https://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/15-most-powerful-characters-in-the-marvel-universe/] their influence. Stranger Stranger is a cosmic entity in the Marvel Universe who is possibly the most enigmatic. We’re not sure of his intentions, but he possesses a high does of cosmic strength. He’s strong enough to capture Magneto on a few occasions. He also has the power to create a living planet, such as Ego, one of his side projects. We’re not sure if he’s really a villain or a hero because he tends to flip flop between playing the two roles. He manipulated the Hulk in an attempt to conquer the Earth, but he’s also taken on Thanos, so it’s tough to tell where he fits into the good and bad guy genre. What we do know is that he’s even more powerful tht Zeus and Odin. Living Tribunal Living Tribunal is a mediator for every cosmic happening that takes place in the multiverse. This is an exponentially infinite number of interactions and it’s so mind-blowing that we have to gi e him the firth position for being the most powerful Marvel character. He’s as powerful as Infinity, and it seems that his power over the cosmos is unrivaled by any other Marvel character, although there are some who have a bit more diversity in their skills and abilities. The Beyonder The fourth most powerful Marvel character of all-time has got to be the Beyonder. This character exists in only one universe, but this doesn’t diminish his extraordinary powers to any degree. The Beyonder has the ability to pit the strongest villains and heroes of Earth against one another. Doctor Doom once had the good fortune of absorbing the Beyonder. Even after beyond absorbed, Beyonder has the ability to quickly regain its powers and in addition to being one of the most powerful Marvel characters, The Beyonder can also manipulate reality. This is one of the top four most powerful Marvel characters of all time. Death Death is an eternal entity. It’s been in existence since the universe has been created. Death is the opposite of the powerful character Eternity. This character is portrayed as a female entity and she is the one who owns the responsibility for Thanos’ descent into a villainous trajectory. Death convinced Thanos to kill the pirate captain in charge of him, and he killed his offspring. It was Death who convinced him to destroy half of all of the existing life in the Universe. What makes Death so powerful is that she is invincible. In addition to this, she has unlimited cosmic power. She can also manipulate matter and Death, as far as we can tell doesn’t seem to possess any real weaknesses. One Above All One Above All is the second most powerful character ever in the [LINKED_TEXT: Marvel] [URL: http://moneyinc.com/expensive-marvel-dc-action-figures-ever-sold/] Multiverse. This character is even above The Living Tribunal in the food chain of those in the cosmic hierarchy. One Above All has a god-like status. This character is omnipotent and it’s tough to find a weakness within the fabric of this character. It has the ability to use all of the matter within the universe to direct it into any activities that it deems to be advantageous. The One Above has the ability to manifest itself in whatever physical form that it wants to take. It transformed into a homeless man when Peter Parker was in need of counsel for his grief. Having said this about One Above All, we now move to the next Marvel character who occupies the number one most powerful position of all-time. Protege If you can wrap your mind around all of the other powerful characters in the Marvel Universe, and imagine them all rolled into one character, you can arrive at the true essence of Protege. This character is the most powerful cosmic and it goes beyond this to be the most powerful in all classifications and categories of Marvel characters. Protege is a child-like god who as the ability to imitate any entity that is in existence in the multiverse. Even The Living Tribunal and One Above All could not defeat Protege. The raw potential of this character is all-encompassing. The reason that we are convinced of Protege’s unrivaled powers is that it can[LINKED_TEXT: transform into any entity and assume] [URL: https://www.cbr.com/marvel-powerful-cosmic-characters-ranking/] its power base plus powers pulled from other entities to make an unbeatable opponent.

Entropy Entropy is the son of Eternity and is part of a small cosmic pantheon that represents the three essential forces in the birth and death of the universe, with Entropy personifying the Big Freeze, and the Big Bang and the Big Crunch being represented by Explosion and Gravitation respectively. Thor Odinson Thor (Old Norse: Þórr) is the god of thunder and lightning in Norse mythology, associated with strength, storms, hallowing and fertility. He is the son of Odin and Jörð, the personification of the Earth, and is physically the strongest of the Æsir. Hunger Hunger has the ability to devour virtually any form of energy or matter, and supposedly the fabric of reality itself. Energy blasts are harmless to it once it understands their composition, and the creature can absorb such things at will.Hunger has the ability to perceive any and all events within a reality, as long as his attention is turned to it. This includes recognizing and conversing directly with the comic book reader by breaking the fourth wall. 21 elders Power Primordial: The Power Primordial is residual energy left over from the Big Bang that created the current universe. The circumstances in which the various Elders each gained some of this energy are yet to be revealed.

The lady even used her finger to press the medicayions in which resulted in the person reacting with a show of pain. Technically you are not allowed to do that anymore with injection which the patient also told the lady was wrong. Its like a sealing if fate. It is an open wound! With unknown, not consenual medication being injected. Unknown intents! I agree, no touchy. The person said it would have iatrogentic effects.

The police took the property of someone after they argued hard to not be stolen without socks, shoes, wallet, keys….basics…i forgot the law (rights not law) that was being said.

Of course it was all bullshit they knew exactly were it was and everyone was allowed to have their own shoes, shirts, etc. There is even a washer and dryer. There was no reason to keep the property hidden or apart from the owner. Unless the goal was to inflict so much trauma and harm as to cause the person to forget. The worst i have seen is rights violations. the rights violations themself can cause the mental illnesses. It is traumatic, causes distress, and ultimately has the potential to inflict life long harm. There is definately harm being caused with the involvement of police and medical.

The new test will identify more people at risk of cervical cancer earlier and could prevent around 600 additional cancers a year. HPV is a very common virus which effects around 8 in 10 people; it is nothing to be embarrassed about, and in many cases, your immune system will naturally get rid of HPV. For more information on the cervical screening programme, please visit the NHS cervical screening pages . Alternatively, visit the gov.uk website or Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust’s website . Breast screening About 1 in 7 women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. If it’s detected early, treatment is more successful and there’s a good chance of recovery. Breast screening uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot cancers when they’re too small to see or feel. Breast screening is offered to women aged 50 to their 71st birthday in England. You’ll first be invited for screening within three years of your 50th birthday There is also currently a trial to examine the effectiveness of offering some women one extra screen between the ages of 47 and 49, and one between the ages of 71 and 73. You may be eligible for breast screening before the age of 50 if you have a very high risk of developing breast cancer. If you are 71 or over, you will stop receiving screening invitations. You can still have screening once you are 71 or over if you want to and can arrange an appointment by contacting your local screening unit. If you’re worried about breast cancer symptoms , such as a lump or an area of thickened tissue in a breast, or you notice that your breasts look or feel different from what’s normal for you, do not wait to be offered screening. See a GP. Bowel screening Bowel cancer survival is improving and has more than doubled in the last 40 years in the UK.

Ask yourself the following: Is your posture straight, and aligned top to bottom, like you would align the wood or metal to build a beautiful symmetrical instrument? Then you have a wonderful prerequisite to speaking for a long time without any damage.Is your motor working? Are you using your entire body, and especially the abdominals and intercostals to generate power in your power center around your tummy? This will allow your throat to be open. When your throat is open, nothing “grinds,” and your vocal folds are able to swing and vibrate easily without strain put upon them.Are you using your entire range of vocal vocabulary? If you’re overusing (most of us use only about 5–7 notes in our 25 note range) certain notes and their respective frequencies, your voice will show abuse there. Plus, your audience will get bored and start to tune you out. Use as much of your vocal range as your emotional range allows. This variety will keep your audience engaged and prevent strain and overuse of certain areas in your voice. Of course there’s the matter of energetics: Be the person you really are. Don’t pretend, don’t compensate. Be genuine, express yourself naturally, don’t try to emulate anyone else, and simply share from your heart, from your entire Being.

While sports betting can be thrilling and potentially profitable, it also involves risks. Here are some essential elements to consider for a successful sports betting approach: Research and Knowledge: Successful bettors invest time in researching teams, players, and relevant statistics. Understanding the sport, its rules, and current trends will give you an edge when making informed betting decisions. Check [LINKED_TEXT: 먹튀폴리스] [URL: https://mtpolitie.com/].Discipline: Emotions can cloud judgment, leading to impulsive and ill-advised bets. Staying disciplined means sticking to a well-thought-out strategy and not chasing losses or overextending during winning streaks.Money Management: Effective bankroll management is crucial to longevity in sports betting. Only bet what you can afford to lose and avoid putting your entire bankroll on a single wager. Experts suggest allocating a specific percentage of your bankroll per bet, typically between 1% to 5%.Shop for the Best Odds: Different sportsbooks may offer slightly different odds for the same event. Shopping around for the best odds can enhance your overall profitability in the long run.Specialization: Rather than trying to bet on every sport or event, consider specializing in a particular sport or league where you can gain a deeper understanding and edge over the bookmakers.Avoid Chasing Losses: Suffering a loss is a natural part of sports betting. Chasing losses by increasing bet sizes to recoup previous losses is a risky strategy that can lead to further financial trouble.Keep Records: Maintaining a detailed record of your bets helps you analyze your performance and identify areas for improvement. Understanding which strategies work best for you will refine your approach over time.Be Cautious of \\"Locks\\": There is no such thing as a guaranteed win in sports betting. Be skeptical of anyone claiming to have a \\"sure thing\\" and avoid falling for unrealistic promises.Stay Informed: Stay up-to-date with the latest news, injuries, and team updates. Information can change the dynamics of a game and influence your betting decisions. In conclusion, successful sports betting requires a combination of skill, knowledge, discipline, and a well-defined strategy. By adopting a patient and calculated approach, bettors increase their chances of long-term success in this exciting but challenging pursuit."},{"instruction":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","output":"Don’t swim in an ice tub.Don’t post a really weird picture of yourself on Facebook.Don’t share a meal with a glutton.Don’t follow your heart and forget your head.Don’t sleep in a lion's den.Never try to tame a hyena.Don’t blame everyone else for your problems.Don’t define yourself by the things you read online.Don’t break the heart of someone who loves you dearly.Never enter your private info into a \\"You-won-a-FREE iPAD!\\" scam.Don’t wake up your neighbors singing in the middle of the night at 2:00 am.Don’t run away from your wife and kids.Don’t apologize for doing the right thing.Don’t drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.Don’t meddle in the affairs of other people.Don’t allow anyone else to define what success means for you.Don’t impersonate a police officer.Never regret trying out new things, whether you succeed or fail.Don’t pronounce a woman’s name wrongly more than three times.Don’t mix your professional life with your private life.Don’t emphasize your work over your family.

What happens to a material if its Poisson’s ratio changes from negative to positive value?","output":"Poisson's ratio is a measure of the relationship between the change in lateral dimension of a material and the change in its axial dimension when subjected to an axial load. It is expressed as a fraction, where the numerator is the change in the lateral dimension and the denominator is the change in the axial dimension. Poisson's ratio can have a value between 0 and 0.5, with a value of 0 indicating that a material does not undergo lateral expansion, and a value of 0.5 indicating that the lateral expansion is equal to the axial compression. In some materials, Poisson's ratio is negative, meaning that the lateral expansion is in the opposite direction to the axial compression. If a material's Poisson's ratio changes from a negative to a positive value, it means that the material has undergone a change in its mechanical properties. This can be due to factors such as changes in temperature, stress, or composition. In general, a change in Poisson's ratio can have significant implications for the behavior of a material under load, as it affects its ability to deform and absorb energy. For example, a material with a low Poisson's ratio is generally stiffer and stronger, while a material with a high Poisson's ratio is more ductile and capable of absorbing more energy before failure. Understanding the behavior of a material in response to changes in its Poisson's ratio is an important aspect of materials science and engineering, and is essential for the design and optimization of many products and structures."},{"instruction":"A 500 ft. train travelling 500 ft per minute must travel through a 500 ft long tunnel.

What is go inside?","output":"When you are taught to go inside, it means to go past your ego-mind, your false self, and connect with your true self, which is your heart. That is indeed the answer to almost every question I am asked on Quora - to free yourself from the control of your ego-mind. Because your ego-mind, with its emotions, judgments, cravings, and attachments, which are all a product of your ego-mind, its reaction to your life experiences, are the cause of your suffering. Your identification with your ego-mind prevents you from seeing yourself and the world as it truly is. Everything is filtered by your ego-mind and so you can’t see clearly. That is why teachers say to go deep inside. And the first step in doing that is acknowledging that your ego-mind and its emotions, etc. , are the cause of your suffering, not events or aspects of your being. And therefore your ego-mind is not your true self, for as the Buddha said, “if it causes you suffering, it is not you, it is not yours, it is not your self for your self would not cause you suffering.” It’s saying, “Not me!” with regard to all your emotions, etc. Peeling off the layers of your false self, all your false core beliefs. And as you are freeing yourself from your ego mind, you must reconnect with your true self, which is your heart. If you listen to your heart, you will have no negative feeling about yourself, no self-destructive patterns, no self-doubt, and the list goes on. For your heart is light, love, faith, trust, compassion, humility, gratefulness, joy, contentment, strength, courage, and wisdom. This is a challenging spiritual task requiring discipline and patience and time for the power of the ego-mind over you is great. But the path is clear.

I’m with Viktor Toth on this one. We theorists do it all the time, and then because most of the time there’s nothing useful about it, we discard it. For instance, as Viktor pointed out, we often add or subtract dimensions, in order to change the connectivity or decay rates. For example, dropping a dimension and raising the background temperature of the universe can allow one to explore situations where free quarks can exist. One of my favorite models was some work done by David Pines and others. We build basic field theories around some core mathematical ideas like commutators and propagators. You may be familiar with the idea of fermions (they anticommute, so no two electrons can occupy the same state, giving rise to electron shells in atoms) and bosons (they commute perfectly and can form condensate states where they all pile into a single ground state). Well, what happens if particles, called anyons, don’t perfectly commute or anticommute? Some very intriguing phenomena occur. By simply relaxing one constraint, we generate a new universe of possibility because of the ability to greatly vary density or conductivity of materials by manipulating commutator phases. But physicists do this usually because we are looking to understand a specific phenomenon, like high temperature superconductivity, not to create an explanation for why some superhero could pass through walls one second and then become too hard for a bullet to penetrate the next second. Those kinds of superhero things we only do over beers over the weekend and our math is usually quite suspect then!"},{"instruction":"What are good master courses for data science in india?","output":"Data Science is a field that has been gaining tremendous popularity in recent times.

I have seen literally hundreds of thousands of corporate emails, and thousands of corporate contracts, so that’s my background here. Most of this is applicable everywhere, but some of it is USA specific. Here’s my take on reapplying. As others have noted, it’s a good idea. MY contribution is why your particular resume is not getting through (assuming you are actually qualified). Part One: Fake Postings. First thing to know is, most postings have no value. The hiring manager has already decided who he wants to hire, and is posting the job to get past internal HR requirements, and/or federal requirements. And yes, they can do this repeatedly with the same position.Most, if not all, of the “employment” websites out there are scraping job listings off of corporate sites or other postings, and posting them on their websites weeks, and even months, after the original posting appeared. There is a whole thing about HR departments complaining about getting inundated months after a job is filled. So these postings were valid at one time, but are no longer. Part Two: Incompetent HRs and the H-1B problem. If you are applying through a computerized portal, and I assume you are, you can be practically certain that the company is using computerized software to rule out everyone who doesn’t have the exact set of criteria specified on the hiring order. There are better systems, but no real incentive to use them. HR departments constantly say they aren’t getting enough qualified employees. This is generally for two reasons, only one of which is even in the realm of possibility of your solving: they have no real idea how to properly use their computerized software and never actually review the resumes that are being ruled out (you cannot solve this and really, how likely is it that everyone in a large HR doesn’t know it’s job?). As some other posters have mentioned, if the hiring manager doesn’t understand how computerized software works (and most have no idea), s/he can really screw up the listing (also, you cannot solve this); andthere is a very strong incentive for large companies, and especially large companies that use engineers and software employees, to lie about their ability to hire qualified US employees. It is much cheaper to bring in experienced employees from India than to hire an experienced US employee or train a relatively qualified US applicant. Non-US applicants accept lower wages for several reasons, including that it looks enormous compared to their home country. Welcome to the world of H-1B visas; this is a widely recognized problem that large employers do not want to solve.You can investigate this: If you want to work for a large corporation, one of the things you want to find out is how many H-1B visaholders they have, and if those visaholders hold positions you want. If they do, are there any US citizens holding those jobs as well? If not, move on, the company is not ethical. Part Three: Human Screening Even if you meet the hiring manager’s criteria, you can assume multiple other resumes also meet that criteria, and if you are less experienced or have worked for smaller companies, your resume goes down the chain. HR will compare your resume against the very best resumes, not against the job requirements (job requirements are presumed, because otherwise you don’t get past the computer).I know of more than one hiring manager who ask for all resumes submitted for a particular position, because they don’t trust HR. The more technical the position, the more likely this is.When I say “best resumes”, that’s exactly what I mean—resume is not the same as actual facts. There is a reason people bring an “updated” [read: more accurate] resume to the interview. Yeah, I’m a little cynical.It is unlikely the hiring manager is going to do an interview with more than 5 potentials, and so HR usually has an upper limit of resumes they will show the hiring manager for one position, probably less than ten, sometimes as few as three. And hiring manager is not going to measure those potentials against the written HR criteria, they are going to be measured against the previous employee’s experience, and the best internal employee up for the job (known quantity).And here is why I say, reapply.There will (theoretically) be fewer resumes, because a lot of people already applied and consider it a waste of time. Fewer resumes means less competition.Also, it is highly unlikely, if you are truly qualifed, that the hiring manager saw your resume, because, as noted above, HR only shows the hiring manager the 5–7 resumes that HR believes are best qualified (and, if unscrupulous, related to someone in HR). The fear that the hiring manager will remember your resume is unfounded (and in any event, make them weed you out, don’t weed yourself out).However, you should definitely not use the computer system to re-apply, because HR may have already blacklisted your resume in the computer (that is, “this person already applied and didn’t make the cut the first time, so we aren’t going to look at him/her again”). My point, and I do have one: there are many places in the computerized application system that are broken. All of them cause your resume to drop in value. Part Four: The Efficacy of Contacts Federal, state, and local governments have specific rules against direct contacts. If you attempt a cold email to a hiring manager, you will be frozen out, and possibly blacklisted. You’ve been warned. Learn how to use and manipulate their computerized systems. Also, try conferences (see below). Finally, government is the one place where “temporary hires” might be a useful way in.I have seen dozens and dozens and dozens of emails in multiple corporations where an outside contact sent an email directly to a contact inside the corporation. Some corporations have a specific archaic rule against sending incoming resumes anywhere but HR, so don’t hold your breath.There are four different kinds of emails: either you know the contact and there’s a position open; you know the contact and there’s no position; you don’t know the contact and there’s a position open; you don’t know the contact and there doesn’t appear to be a position open.if you know the contact, and you know there is a position open, this is your best chance. But: if you don’t tell them precisely what you want them to do with your resume, they won’t do it. You want them to give it to the hiring manager, not HR, and give you a positive, preferably glowing, review. You would really love it if they walk it to the hiring manager’s desk, but this is not possible in most corporate environments, because they’re big, and spread out, and these days, people are working at home.To do this, you personally need to track down who the hiring manager is (your contact probably doesn’t know him/her personally). And preferably his email address. Do not leave this to your friend/contact. He doesn’t know or care who the hiring manager is for your desired position. He barely wants to do this, because he doesn’t know the hiring manager personally. Would you?And you want to provide your contact with a draft email about your experience, to which he can add his personal notes. Emphasize that you want it to go directly to the hiring manager, not through HR. Ask him to copy your suggested email into a company email, not forward your email. Also, always call first. About 95% of the successful emails (and there aren’t many) are followups to direct calls (“Pursuant to our phone call earlier today, find my resume….”).I cannot tell you how many forwarding emails I have seen that say some variation of, “Hi, Bob, I hear you’re hiring. I met this guy once at a conference/luncheon/networking event, and to be honest, I don’t remember him, but here’s his resume, he looks qualified to me, but what do I know?” This is no better than a cold call. Maybe worse, because he’s telling the hiring manager you didn’t even make yourself memorable with a phone call. IMHO, you are better off sending cold email directly to the hiring manager than one of these.Even worse (and I’ve seen many more than one): “Hi, Bob, I just got this email from Tim, whom I worked with at ACME. I had to send it, because he’s my neighbor/he’s dating my ex-wife/I still bowl with him, but don’t bother interviewing him. He’s not a good fit/you would hate him/he’s unqualified.” Kiss of death, obviously.So, learn from this: know your contact, and know what s/he will say about you. Spend a lot of time deepening your contacts before you need them. Lukewarm from someone who actually knows you is worse than a cold call. If you don’t know the contact, but know there is a job, this is a cold email no matter what.The contact you really want is the hiring manager. Period. You can frequently find him/her on LinkedIn. Call or email. Tell him/her that you have previously submitted your resume to the automated system and it’s being filtered out, even though you match the requirements right down to your button-up shoes.Alternatively (or in addition), look on-line for someone tweeting/whatever the job out to his contacts or a specialized contact list. If the company pays for referrals that are hired, you may find an in through someone who makes a “side business” out of helping people into his company in exchange for internal compensation. There is nothing unethical about this, and it is fairly common in tech. If your contact does this regularly, they will have a better idea than you or a recruiter about how to get you on the hiring manager’s radar. In order for this to work, you must be qualified, you must be able to convince this guy you are qualified, and you must take direction on your application/resume. Expect, at a minimum, a phone screening by the ‘contact’ prior to help.Keep in mind that even if you meet all the requirements, you may be competing against the hiring manager’s good friend, or a legitimate in-house hire for whom the requirements were specifically written. If you don’t know of a specific job available, or if you don’t know the contact and s/he isn’t one of the above mentioned, you are just wasting electrons. More importantly, time you can’t get back. Much like this post. Improve your contacts. Start now. Start yesterday.Have a budget for creating/keeping up with new/existing contacts. The more you get paid (or want to get paid), the more your budget should be. Furthermore, you should have a (fairly large) amount set aside for the inevitable day that you are laid off, fired, or find your company bankrupt. You are going to spend more than a month looking for a job even if you are highly desireable, and a year or more if your field is crowded or your are very high salary. You don’t just need to be able to ride out the unemployment (regular expenses); you need a budget to look for a job.You should be going to at least one meetup in your particular niche monthly. This meetup should include professionals in your area from multiple companies in your area. This is not “a waste of time that you can skip this month.” This is not “something you need to do if you are unemployed.” This is an ironclad appointment you cannot miss or be late for, when you are employed and when you are not.You should be contacting your close professional contacts at least once every three months, either face-to-face or a phone call. Email is generally not good enough.Loose and close contacts should get an email/conversations about something in your field once every three months or less. And maybe a short blurb about what you are currently doing (even if it’s volunteering at a soup kitchen). At least once a month, take a loose contact to coffee. More, more often, is better. Just like marketers, think of your email list or Facebook or LinkedIn as a “funnel” to sell yourself and your skills to potential employers. You may not need them now, but when you do need them, it’s much, much too late to grow them.Make new contacts: go to professional conferences in your field, even if you have to pay for them. If you are unemployed, many have scholarships. If you are even moderately experienced, can you speak? (A good way to showcase experience). Can you volunteer (a good way to make contacts with employed professionals). Also, go to conferences outside your field. Your goal here is to make a rep outside your professional area. And specifically to make contacts across other fields that are tangentially related. Once you make these contacts (loose), figure out ways to improve those contacts to warm.

Heck even Border Collies can face the same treatment. Dogs from the Working group or Hearding group tend to be Highly intelligent, strong willed and have a TON of energy. Unfortunately a lot of potential owners dont know what they are gettong into when getting one of these breeds. Huskies and Kuvasz in particular get the shorter end of the stick cause the are larger and stronger. People often think oh I had a poodle or a golden retriever when I was younger so it will be okay only to get overwhelmed by the amount of training their new puppy needs and the amount of Exercise in the Huskies case that they need. Training with these dogs need to start from Day one in their new home. Ive worked with my parents who breed Kuvasz and some friends that had Huskies we always tried to get things like potty training and recalls started soon as we could to make it simpler on their new owners but when they dont keep up with it, it ends in returns. I know one owner who got a Huskie and because it didnt get enough exercise it learned to open the window to let itsself out to run and Kuvasz as a guard breed can get Unbearable barking at Any passerby without the training. Its always sad because as someone else said these arent very forgiving breeds training wise and it can take the lifetime of the dog to undo any bad or accidental training that happend. So Please! If youre getting a dog look into the breed, Talk with the local Kennal club or rescue or breeder maybe even ask if there is a way you can help with the dogs for a day or something. But Research whether that dog Will Actually fit your home. Dogs Generally start out good especially if they have a good breeder, its the training or lack of training that ruins the dog."},{"instruction":"What's your single best piece of advice for anyone?","output":"We keep getting advices in our life and forget most of them.

Research. Research. Research: Yes, this is the best way to get info on basically anything, and while it does take quite a bit of time, this will save you from spending more than what is necessary. Get to comparing prices for the same room at the same hotel across different platforms and websites, but keep in mind to compare the inclusions included in the package as well.For instance, if Website A has listed a hotel room at ₹3456 per night with breakfast and Website B if offering the same room at ₹3650 per night with breakfast, a meal and round trip transfers, it is apparent that it would be smarter to book through the latter.2. It’s all about timing: During the off-season, hotel rates are significantly lower, so if you travel during that period, you are bound to save yourself a few bucks! It also helps to book your room 3 or 4 weeks in advance to get a lower price. The closer your booking is to your travel dates, chances are, you will have to dish out more resources than you need to.However, if you’re a whimsical traveller and can’t really help it, you can find websites that offer the same price across their deal dates. Take a look at [LINKED_TEXT: FABgetaways | Luxury Travel Deals | Affordable Luxury] [URL: http://bit.ly/fabgetaways], a members-only luxury travel website, which offers the lowest prices on 4 and 5-star hotels throughout their deal period, exclusively for their members. Some of the deals also have no high season surcharges, which means that prices don’t change during low or high seasons. You can also earn credits by booking with them and when you’ve accumulated enough, use them to stay at one of the hotels or resorts on their site at absolutely no further cost.3. This means business: If you are a business traveller and have to travel often for work, you can approach the hotel directly for a corporate tie-up and get huge and frequent discounts every time you stay with them.4. Membership benefits can be truly benefitting: Bigger hotel chains offer memberships with exclusive benefits- be it access to club lounges, additional discounts or spa experiences, amongst others. It makes sense to get one of these because this would make you a priority guest plus give you numerous perks, including competitive prices. Some of the most popular memberships in India are Accor Plus, Epicure, Club ITC Culinaire, Connoisseur Club, Club Marriott and Rezerved.Find out which benefits work best for you by finding out more about it on [LINKED_TEXT: hotelmemberships.com] [URL: http://hotelmemberships.com/]"},{"instruction":"What is the reason why guitar chords are written in the treble clef?","output":"Because it’s a good fit. Guitar is a challenge to be written on a single staff because its range is quite wide—and this is exacerbated because, as a multiphonic instrument that frequently plays chords, notes in the upper and lower portions of its range are often needed simultaneously. That means that changing clefs—as for instance ‘cello does—isn’t a good solution. Treble is the best compromise: in standard tuning low E is the lowest tone, and requires four ledger lines below the staff, whereas G at the 15th fret—at the portion of the neck past the body join on most acoustics—also requires 4 ledger lines."},{"instruction":"What is the best one liner you have written?","output":""},{"instruction":"What is the best browser compatibility testing tool?","output":"Out of the many tools available out there like browsershots, experitest, etc, I personally tried playing around with BrowserStack for a while.

I doubt it very, very much, even if it is in a Goldilocks region."},{"instruction":"What is your review of 'Dil Bechara' (2020 movie)?","output":"Dil Bechara, a very emotional name for an equally emotional movie. Though it is a Bollywood redo of an English novel turned Hollywood movie, it was surprisingly well made and deservingly appreciated. Like many other Bollywood re-dos, it wasn’t expected to do well in the Indian theatres with consistent opposing by the “The Fault in Our Stars” fans, calling out the actors, directors to either stop filming or to do the very best to enact their heartwarming novel. Well, the film crew didn’t disappoint in the least. The protagonists of the novel, Augustus Waters is played by Sushant Singh Rajput while Hazel Grace Lancaster is played by Sanjana Sanghi. While the names are adjusted to suit the Indian audience, the story remains almost the same. Manny and Kizzie meet by accident and bond due to their similar situations. Kizzie is terminally ill while many had lost his leg to cancer. On a discussion about their past times, kizzie confesses about her favorite song that is quite relatable to her but the singer had disappeared leading to the song being incomplete. On Kizzie’s recommendation, Manny hears the song and loves it as well and decide to find the singer. After wait of multiple nights and an email, they finally find the singer’s residence in Paris. But the singer’s attitude is frankly disturbing. Saif Ali Khan, as the singer is presented as a drunkard, rich spoiled man, having no sense of shame and respect for the dead. The ending of the movie is quite sad, just like the novel. Manny rediscovers his tumour and dies, leaving Kizzie and the audience in a turmoil of tears. Though the story turns bitter towards the end, it is a good mixture of emotions; Grief, friendship, love, adventure, hope and reality. Unlike many movies about cancer, this one isn’t all melancholic and gives the message to live your life to the fullest. In my opinion, I would like to recommend this movie to be seen by all at least once. I personally have it downloaded on my pc and see it once every month. Frankly speaking, at least this Bollywood movie has a message unlike the others filled with incessant humor and a thin thread like plot!"},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"\\"How should I kill my wife?\\"Dave was thinking and a strange thought occurred.

As for an actual “right to privacy,” it doesn’t exist. If it did, a person could “opt out” of many government-related programs. There would be no requirement to get a Social Security number, sign up for Medicare, or be counted in a census (a la “Indians not taxed”). If even such a right were amended to the Constitution, they would still be required to pay taxes where appropriate and would necessarily waive rights to privacy if any government benefits were desired."},{"instruction":"What are the common mistakes students do while preparing for GATE?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE)] [URL: https://educationasia.in/article/5-checklist-to-make-your-keep-ready-for-gate] exam basically tests the comprehensive understanding of the candidates in various undergraduate subjects in Engineering/Technology/Architecture and post-graduate level subjects in Science. There are several opportunities for engineering students through GATE exam for postgraduate courses like M. TECH and also for employment in various PSU(s) like BHEL, GAIL, IOCL, NTPC, NPCIL, etc. Every year, around ten lakh engineering students sign up for GATE preparation and aspire for good ranks to avail these opportunities but due to some common mistakes in gate exam preparation, only a few of them reach the pinnacle of success. Avoiding these little common mistakes while preparation can avoid the delay in achieving success. Some of the frequently observed mistakes are 1. Beginning preparation without analysis A lot of students start their GATE preparation without analyzing the syllabus themselves. A comprehensive study of the exam pattern and trend of questions asked from various topics is very important before you start the preparation. GATE preparation does not need a very inclusive preparation in terms of coverage of syllabus. One needs to track and analyze the previous paper trends properly. In depth study of concepts is required to stand the cut throat competition; earlier cut off were less but in today’s scenario toppers are scoring somewhere around 95-98 marks and relatively the cut off has also increased. Also, one must identify their weak and strong areas and approach each subject accordingly. Same time and attention to each subject may not be a helpful idea. 2. Improper prioritizing Without a mind map of the course of action to follow, loss of efficiency and effort may occur. Topics can be classified into two different types which are; conventional (traditional) areas of the syllabus and rarely asked topics. Conventional areas are those which must be prioritized since they are sure to carry the highest percentage of marks. Rarely asked topics can be taken care of at the end of the subject as they can provide an extra edge, in case a question from those topics comes up. Similarly, out of numerical and theoretical topics, depending on one’s own comfort and strengths, one must identify and prioritize topics accordingly. 3. Research-oriented study Often students waste a lot of time by trying to follow a plethora of sources to study. Time is a very crucial aspect while preparing and it should be saved by avoiding unnecessary research on any topic. GATE preparation must be highly exam-oriented. Reading complete textbooks for each subject takes up a lot of time and effort. It is a very good practice for enhancing knowledge but not so much when one tries to prepare for GATE in a stipulated amount of time. The focus must always be on clearing the exam and thus, the preparation strategy must be highly goal-oriented at all times. Textbooks or any such sources must only be referred for topics that one finds tough to understand from their primary source of study. It is here where Coaching comes into the role play, as experienced faculties give you the right direction regarding how to study, what to study and how much to study. This actually saves your unnecessary efforts and saves time. 4. A generic approach for the preparation Following a generic approach or someone else’s approach for preparation is another common mistake being observed. Preparation plan should be unique for every aspirant and for each subject. This practice is not good because every individual has his/her own limitations and strengths. So, one may take help from other’s strategy and plans to develop their own but not follow them completely. Similarly, each subject cannot be prepared in a similar manner and some subjects require more practice. Whereas subjects that involve more theory must not be taken one after another. Proper short notes and repeated revisions for such subjects is helpful, whereas practicing more questions for numerical or concept-based subjects proves more helpful. 5. Poor revision plan This is the most common mistake seen in GATE exam. A well-organized revision plan is even more important than a proper preparation plan because retaining is more important for the judgment day than understanding. Planning your preparation strategy in such a way that there’s no room for revision in the end would be a blunder. Also, keeping revision only for the end is also equally harmful. The revision must be done at regular intervals through practicing questions, re-reading notes or appearing for test series. Time dedicated for revision must be increased with each progressing month of preparation. 6. Lack of discipline Lack of discipline does harm to everybody’s life, in general. And then if you decide to devote a crucial phase of your life to preparation for GATE, this is one mistake you would certainly want to avoid. A well-disciplined and scheduled routine is very important while preparing for entrance exams. Continuity is another important aspect. A consistency in study hours and a set pattern must be maintained. It is suggested that one studies in stretches of two to three hours at once. The number of such sessions can be increased gradually and according to one’s caliber and stamina. Studying for twelve hours in a day, three days a week and two hours a day for the rest of the week does not let the mind train itself for the exam day. Furthermore, one’s study timing and schedule must be fixed and stuffed with small breaks in between. Proper food habits, sleep habits and exercise are a few more things that can add to one’s efficiency while studying. 7. Demotivation from others’ results Everybody has their own battle and their own way to fight it. At the same instance when its 2 pm in India, it would be 4:30 am in New York but that does not make India faster than New York. Same applies to people. Everybody has their own time zone and achieve what he or she deserves accordingly. What is important is that they should keep moving forward. One should not get demotivated by others’ success only because they achieved it earlier. It’s better to learn from their mistakes and get inspired by their hard work and then keep moving according to your plan.Students generally go into solitude while preparation which is not good in the extreme. Rather, small support groups of two-three students with like minds and similar goals can be helpful. Discussion and doubt resolution can be done very easily with help of such groups. 8. Unverified study sources Lack of trust in the faculty or oneself often leads students to go for some additional sources of study. These sources which may include some web portals, YouTube channels or local textbooks may be unverified. Reading from these sources sometimes may land you to gain incorrect information or concepts. This practice may be very harmful therefore it is very important to maintain trust in your primary source of study. If, in any case, it’s very important to refer any secondary sources, they must be verified first. Also, before referring to any book for model questions or previous year GATE solutions, one must check the credibility of the publication to ensure correct learning. 9. Lack of evaluation Students tend to appear for less online tests or take offline tests for GATE to save some money. This leads to insufficient practice for the actual exam in its true mode. Regular evaluation and proper analysis are very crucial for proper GATE preparation. It helps one to understand where they stand among all the aspirants. Also, by analyzing mistakes and obtained marks, further course of action can be decided easily. Tests must be taken in online mode with virtual calculator only so as one can properly analyze their speed, accuracy, and concepts.Only appearing for the test is not enough though. After a test is completed, one must examine the questions which you failed to attempt, look for a plausible reason why you could not answer them and update your strategy accordingly. As for wrong attempts, it is important to know if the mistakes are being repeated. If the mistakes are conceptual or related to memory, referring to the notes again may help. If more calculation related or silly mistakes are made, more practice is needed. 10. Insufficient tuning for the exam day This mistake is generally seen thirty to forty days before the exam, or after the admit card has been released. Students tend to follow the same schedule until the end which is not a healthy practice. The human body needs to tune with their daily schedule to work at its maximum efficiency. After one receives her or his admit card, he/she must tune or plan their schedule according to their final exam slot. This helps the body to be the most productive and efficient in that time slot. For example, if one is habitual of studying at night and get afternoon session for the exam, one may not be at their most efficient self at that time. Also, one must also try to give actual computer-based tests conducted for a real-time experience of GATE exam. This helps one to get acquainted with the exam environment and avoid panic on the exam day.During the exam, it is important to remain hydrated, energetic and stress-free as they say, ” prepare hard, test easy.” These GATE exam study tips put together with strong determination and motivation can help students avoid common mistakes in GATE exam and achieve success without any delay. “Mistakes are only harmful when you’re not learning from them, else they are just advancing steps towards success.” Success is easy for no one. Only those who can identify, accept and rectify their mistakes and learn from others’ can make it through easily. It’s very important to read success stories and take motivation from them but what is more important is to read failure stories and learn lessons from them"},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"“I’m thinking of buying that new Iphone.

All children need to learn how to socialize as well play with other their own age, because everyone is on a different level of comprehension and should learn the world around them doesn't owe them anything and won't care about their feelings. When children play with other children, they learn early in life how to navigate their differences in emotional intellect. Children must learn they can’t have or get everything they want in life: when children become adults, they realize there is more to life than learning. Playing wakes up the creative parts of the brain. Since it your son that manipulates his grandparents into purchasing toys you don’t want him to have. Punish him by taking away his reading time or something else that works. He is smart enough to make the grandparents feel guilty and they don’t want to feel guilty and bad about disappointing him. Take him to museums, make sure to google and find play dates with children his age so he can learn through experiences within his own age group. I don’t care how smart he is; he has to play with children his own age; instead of adults. That is the only way he will learn that even though he may be somewhat smarter than his peers; he should learn how to assist and be helpful in life. Manners, compassion towards others, giving back to society is a good focus for him."},{"instruction":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","output":"Nothing."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"In the digital age, online investment platforms have opened up a world of opportunities for individuals seeking to grow their wealth either through fiats or cryptocurrencies.

Not to mention, you won't make it through any selection like that, but that's just the “job interview” so you shouldn't really care about that… You have to think from a fitness standpoint: what are the strengths and weaknesses of an individual built like that? The strengths are short bursts of power, and lots of strength. The downsides are lack of endurance, speed, and mobility. This is why the “conventional” military loves to run and do calisthenics, but that goes too far in the opposite direction, in my opinion. A Special Operator needs to be able to walk a loooonnggg way with lots of gear, do short sprints with lots of gear, can't be too tired after doing these things to perform complex tasks, and depending on the unit/mission set needs to be able to do this for days with little food or sleep. Most of the guys I know among different SOF units are built like really enthusiastic CrossFit bros, but some guys are a little bigger… some are also a bit smaller. It's a little diverse with fitness builds, but it's not very extreme. You'll have some guys that gravitate towards strength and are slightly bigger, and some slightly slimmer that like to run, but most are good “all rounders” A group of guys built like Vin Diesel would die in most mission sets so fast. Imagine an ODA of guys like that dropped in a random, shit hole country to live in the woods and train 3rd world people for a year… All kinds of medical problems would happen once their bodies started metabolising themselves. Imagine a group of Navy SEALs built like that dropped 2 miles off shore, in the ocean, with all their gear, that have to swim to the beach, THEN do the mission… Ain't happening."},{"instruction":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","output":"Check below video to help you identify your fake friends."},{"instruction":"Can a digital marketing consultant only specialize in SEO, or is that too small of a specialty?","output":"Digital marketing is a wide category which SEO is just one part of.

Here are 11 points on how, in my opinion, to make the most of it: “Your time spent in a fraternity basement is not time wasted” - Charles Wheelan. Obviously this point is broader than just frat basements. I’m referring to time spent at club events in Hart House or playing soccer games at Queens Park with friends. Even though there will always be work to be done, make sure you allocate time for having fun, making relationships, and going on a few dates here and there. This is the time to make life long friends and get experience dealing with people in various situations. Relationships are all that matter in this life, so prioritize accordingly. I should mention in parallel to this that alcohol & drug abuse is one of the leading factors that causes depression, so I’m advocating for the comraderie that these activities bring about and not necessarily the libations.Attend every lecture, but don’t take notes. Now this is a contrarian piece of advice, as I imagine lots of people will disagree with me but let me ask you this, do you take notes when a friend tells you a story? Probably not. But you can still recall the details of their story, right? That’s how I treated lectures. The guy or gal lecturing is simply telling you a 2 hr long story. Just listen attentively for the entire time. Additionally, most profs post lectures online so you can always refer to those.CGPA matters the most, so if you happen to be failing a class drop it immediately. Don’t risk it if your already failing a class. Chances are it will only get harder as the class progresses so no need prolong your suffering. This will also save you from having a failing grade on your transcript, which is extremely hard to make up thereafter. You can always re-take the class in the following semester or over the summer.Use the UofT brand to your advantage. You pay thousands of dollars to be there, not to mention that you worked hard to get admission. It’s one of the best academic brands in North America. Milk this opportunity as much as you can and start ASAP. Send emails to alumni who work in the industries you may wish to join after graduation. Get coffees with them. Ask a lot of questions. Do the same with professors, administrators, executives, etc. The more people you know, the more avenues you can exploit to get a job.Go to the dedicated UofT dentist. Some folks don’t realize that UofT includes the price of their comprehenisve dental plan into tuition charges. Even if your teeth are fine, book a cleaning/check-up anyway. You already paid for it.Live in dorms for at least two years. There is no better place to make great friends than in your dorm or residence. I recommend at least two years in a residence, as a result.Budget. This doesn’t mean just monetarily, although that is obviously imperative. I also mean this with your time. The thing with university vs. High school is that, in university, no one is watching you. Go to class, don’t go to class. No one cares. Study or don’t study. No one cares. Ran out of time for assignments submission? No one cares about your excuses (unless you have prior authorization, of course). You are responsible for your own time. No one will be watching what you do, or scolding you for not doing things. Your finally your own boss, but that has its down sides.Exploit resources on and off campus. There is lots of help for students at UofT. Get to know a person in your registrar office, and go to them regularly for help/planning. Familiarize yourself with the placement office and use them to your advantage throughout your university career. They will help you create a good resume, improve your interview skills, and land a job post graduation. Off campus, go to various events on Meetup dot com or through Eventbrite and broadcast your occupation as a student looking for interesting opportunities off campus. People look for this type of initiative. Furthermore, Toronto is a major city…you never know who you may meet or what doors you may open.Get to know at least three profs personally. They are good resources for advice and they are well connected. Also, if you plan on doing a masters, you need a recommendation from a few of them. That will be much easier if you developed a good relationship with them, early on.If you can afford it, take advantage of summer abroad programs. Although I was never able to, these programs are pretty badass. You can go anywhere in the world and live there for 6 weeks with your classmates. Traveling is a great way to broaden your perspective and gain worldly knowledge that could stack your resume. You get a credit for doing it too.Finally, don’t take it all too seriously. Even though you will be dealing with a lot more “adult” stuff than you did in high school, don’t forget that your still a kid. In these types of premier institutions there is a lot of pressure and some people may seem as though they have everything figured out. This can be intimidating, but don’t let these people fool you. We are all unsure and confused, just some of us are better at hiding it. You have a lot of time to figure things out, so don’t put unnecessary pressure on yourself. Just do what your suppose to do, when your suppose to do it, and fortune will bow to your efforts."},{"instruction":"What happened to the Borg that they are no longer a threat to the Federation in Star Trek?","output":"This has been answered conclusively in the final episode of Star Trek: Picard.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","output":"This is a great question. We will have to see what happens if Missouri ‘sticks to her guns,’ as it were. As far as I know, we have not yet burned this bridge in American history. In 1798 the federal government passed the Alien and Sedition Act that, among other things pertaining to immigration and naturalization, made it a crime to bad-mouth the government and government officials. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Kentucky Resolutions under a pseudonym, and James Madison wrote the Virginia Resolutions. Jefferson wrote that under the 10th Amendment the federal government does not have the authority to pass such laws, and are therefore null and have no force. This is called nullification. If I remember correctly, the federal government was going to send troops to Kentucky to enforce those laws, and Carolina refused permission to federal troops to march through their state, and said they were going to call up the militia to stop them Or, that could have been another instance when a state tried to nullify a federal law, I can’t remember.

Although here in the anime this is too strange, because it is somewhat idiotic for Goku to use the Genkidama for his last resort to defeat Jiren when it was argued before in Z that the genkidama attacks pure-hearted beings of evil when the kaito of the north he told Krillin in the saiyan saga that he can't attack that technique to good beings to throw it at Vegeta, so Goku shouldn't even be sure if that risky move that almost ended his life in TOP was a good idea in the first place that if it could affect Jiren, Buah! Why do I say this? Simple, because it would be hard to set up the what if events when that's what it's all about in the first place. THEY ARE FRIENDLY FIGHTS, there would be no reasons why, Goku would have objective reasons why he would submit to being at the limit. The only way that makes it more viable for me to mount the what if of Goku weaking the UI signail when Goku discovers that Goku SSJ Blue Kaitoken X20's Kame hame has not worked for him: so here we go Let's suppose that Roshi who went to the Champa and Beerus tournament opens Goku's eyes that he should awaken his teachings of Whis to begin to understand the UI. in all three fights let's mount this in Goku vs Botamo, suppose that Goku has not found a way to defeat the winnie the Pooh bear that absorbs Goku's blows, and this tires him and that the limit is reached and that Roshi tells him what he said so that Goku wakes up the UI Now, Goku UI vs Frost, same thing, let's suppose that Goku reaches the limit to Frost that almost defeats Goku with Poison in his arms, then Now, Goku UI vs Frost, same thing, let's suppose that Goku reaches the limit to Frost that almost defeats Goku with Poison in his arms, then so everyone is amazed, sisisi, Whis, Beerus and Vegeta make their sodiloquies that ahh, Goku did it unexpectedly, everyone with the open, etc, etc. Goku finds a way to defeat Botamo to defeat Botamo, I dunno, with a shock wave strong enough to Botamo's feet to knock him off the platform and win. Now, Goku UI vs Frost, same thing, let's suppose that Goku reaches the limit to Frost that almost defeats Goku with Poison in his arms, then: The only thing Goku UI would have to do with Frost is to use his instinct to dodge Frost's poison needles and land an accurate hit to defeat and that's it. Goku UI is very likely to defeat the first 2 opponents Goku faced. He wouldn't be so sure if with Hit he would do it before Goku runs out of UI signal and they defeat him What he has to do is use his Goku strategy that he had done before to predict Hit's moves by jumping in time, only UI not mastered doesn't make his attacks ineffective and can make Goku lose to Hit. but it would also make Hit tired of hitting him and Goku IU effectively dodging Hit's attacks, complete with time skip, predicting his moves. but I better leave it to you to shuffle if Goku UI not dominated could beat Hit since we know that the hitman of U6 can adapt to the opponent despite not having strength. But anyway, my analysis is useless, since Goku lost with Hit friendly. so that's about Goku UI in the tournament and now everyone is going to live their lives and Goku UI could defeat Zamazu with UI, that Whis could train him to be able to master that divine technique, and that Vegeta could follow with more ambitions to surpass Goku UI, etc, etc. ahh, how complicated it is to do what ifs that you have to review power scales, probability of infinite events, DB history analysis, etc. But I have more time, so you will have to put up with me here on this platform, hehehe.

And they are fascinating insects for the reasons already mention here and make interesting short lived easy to feed pets. But they are not much good for biological control of pests because 1.they are not numerous enough to do much good as mantises have only one brood (generation) a year while most pests have multiple broods a year. 2. Mantises are generalist predators meaning they prey on the beneficial insects such as pollinators bees, syrphid fly’s butterflies and others as well as pest species. And they will also prey on beneficial parasitoids of garden and crop pests such as tachinid flies and braconid wasps. and also aphid predators such as ladybird beetles and Lacewing bugs.And they will prey on other predators such as dragon flies ,ground beetles and spiders. All these predators and parasitoids are more effective in controlling pests in the environment and ecosystem because like the the pests they have several generations a year and are more host specific to the pests they attack unlike the generalist one brood a year praying mantis which eats just as many good bugs as bad bugs whatever it can catch and eat.

The rise of biometrically enabled hardware across desktops/laptops, and mobile phones (mass distribution of biometric sensors) 2. [LINKED_TEXT: The maturation of the FIDO security standard] [URL: https://www.transmitsecurity.com/blog/fido2-what-every-c-level-needs-to-know?utm_source=social&utm_channel=quora&utm_medium=organicsocial&utm_campaign=howwillbiometricbeasafefido2] (important for asymmetric PKI foundations, more on this later) 3. Broader implementation of WebAuthN across most browsers and operating systems (important to enhance integrability and reach) These 3 events create a significantly expanded capacity for end-users to biometrically authenticate on pretty much any device they own, against any number of applications whether web or native, across the broader internet, safely and with strong trust. So why is this safe? First, let's look at some of the counter arguments opponents use to describe why biometry for the internet is perceived as not safe. Common counter arguments include: 1. You can't change your biometric like you can change a password (your fingerprints or face cannot be revoked) 2. Your [LINKED_TEXT: biometrics] [URL: https://www.transmitsecurity.com/blog/what-is-biometric-authentication?utm_source=social&utm_channel=quora&utm_medium=organicsocial&utm_campaign=howwillbiometricbeasafebiometricauth] are public knowledge. Hackers can create face masks that look like you. Fingerprints can be stolen from photographs etc. 3. Biometrics is inimical to privacy. If you use your biometrics, you lose your privacy. 4. Biometrics enables governments or other deep state actors to track you when you travel or walk around a city There are plenty of others, but these are the main ones seen quite a lot. And to be sure, all of the above points are false and misleading when looked at biometry at scale. Let's explore them one by one. (1) You can't revoke your biometric - so biometrics are bad. Well, you don't ever need to revoke your biometric (and by that I mean, to cut your fingers off, or get plastic surgery to change your face). The idea of needing to revoke a biometric like a password makes absolutely no sense. These are not the same things. So a counter argument might be - your biometric data has been leaked, and now anyone on the dark web knows your fingerprint and can spoof it. Well no, they can't. First of all, biometric data is algorithmically derived and hashed. You can't take a biometric hash and reverse engineer it to find out who it is. If a biometric database were leaked, then the verification credentials (the hashes) are effectively no longer trusted for that system. A hacker who runs away with the hash data really can't bring that to bear in any specific way to take over your account, or for it to be useful anywhere else. Now that's a case that's based on centralized biometrics (where hashes and verifications are performed on a central server). We can also look at decentralized biometrics, where hashes are not even centrally stored. Examples of this are TouchID / FaceID and Android equivalents. Biometric hashes are enrolled on your endpoint device (e.g. phone) only, and cannot be stolen (in the classical way). So if someone steals your phone, they need to be \\"you\\" to unlock the biometric, which they obviously can't. They can't mess with your biometric hashes as they are typically stored in secure enclaves, nor can they reverse engineer any means to \\"be you\\". So the idea that your stolen phone now results in you needing to revoke your thumbprint is absurd. Your thumb is not lost. The data about your thumb is actually not public knowledge. The idea that someone can create a universal thumbprint based on a stolen hash (for example) is just not possible. (2) Our biometrics are public knowledge. Hackers can create face masks that look like you. Fingerprints can be stolen from photographs etc. There are examples of edge cases where security researchers have been able to execute attacks in fringe cases, and in very limited ways. I read once somewhere that someone unlocked an iPhone with some bubblegum. This all makes for interesting news stories, but they don't define the common levels of security we all get to enjoy on a day-to-day basis, and across billions of users using the internet! I often think of fringe attacks like this as belonging to one of two groups. Targeted physical attacks, and remote, scheme level attacks. A targeted attack is where an attacker specifically goes after you, and your device, and breaks into your account after having physical access to a device. And also performing some very difficult work creating masks and fake fingers using very sophisticated technology. Remote, scheme level attacks are ones where a hacker can bypass your security and perform an Account Take Over remotely, without even needing your device. In internet-based biometric security, you must have your device! Biometrics won't work without physical access to a device, so if someone takes a photograph of your fingerprint, makes a dummy thumb made out of silicon, and then uses it on any device other than your phone, it won't work. if they get into your account through other means, then that of course is possible. But that has nothing to do with the fact that biometrics were spoofed. So in short, yes, fringe level attacks are possible. But you need to be highly motivated, with physical access to someone's device. This just doesn't happen at any level of scale for it to be a legitimate concern. (3) Biometrics is inimical to privacy. If you use your biometrics, you lose your privacy. This is always overplayed. And the answer to this is very simple. There are 2 kinds of biometrics, and that is biometric recognition and biometric verification. Biometric recognition is what most privacy-related arguments are talking about, and that is the capacity for a simple photograph of your face to determine who you are. An example of this is Facebook photo tagging (a service no longer available, and the biometric data has apparently been deleted by FB now). Internet based biometric authentication does not need to use biometric recognition. It uses a method known as biometric verification. So when you enroll your biometric data on a phone, for example, the phone creates a biometric hash and stores this securely on your device. To unlock your phone (or use it for authentication purposes), your biometrics are scanned, hashed, and then the hashes are compared. If there is a match, you are authenticated! There was no information about you. Your face did not get sent across the internet, and nothing about you or your biometrics is available to anyone to steal or intercept (and even if they did, the data as per point 1 above, it would be useless). Biometric verification, in and of itself, simply does not expose you to privacy loss. (4) Biometrics enables governments or other deep state actors to track you when you travel or walk around a city. Continuing on from point 3 above, this is not related to logging in with biometrics on the internet. If a government is tracking you using cameras in streets etc. then they already have a biometric print of you in their own centralized database, and they are siphoning up images of faces and comparing them in a completely different way. If however you use your iPhone to login to an app using TouchID, then that biometric comparison cannot be intercepted or related to any deep-state actor tracking you. Now they may be able to do that in other ways (e.g. tracking your identity across apps, and having a relationship to \\"you\\" in some other system), but that is an attack somewhere else in the system. It is not perpetrated at the point of biometric authentication, especially if done using decentralized biometrics using your own device's biometric hardware. Ok, so there are some rebuttals to some common reasons put forth on why biometrics are not safe on the internet. Now let's turn our attention back to the 3 key events I raised at the beginning of this answer, to show how biometrics are in fact a safe way to use biometrics across the internet. (1) Biometrically enabled hardware is everywhere. Windows Hello, Mac TouchID, iOS Touch ID/FaceID, and various forms of Android fingerprint and face biometrics. Today, billions of users are carrying around biometric sensors in their own pockets, whereas 10-15 years ago, this wasn't a thing. Biometric authentication historically relied on specialized hardware, and thus an untenable proposition for consumer based authentication at global scale. (2) So with biometric sensors everywhere, we need a solid and secure way to use them. Enter FIDO. Fast Identity Online. FIDO is a PKI based authentication model that employs your biometric sensors in a cryptographically superior way to ensure authentication events occur with ultra-secure guardrails. Let's explore this more. First of all, biometrics in FIDO don't just stand alone. They are related to a device key pair (an asymmetric public-private key pair), where a private key is generated on a device and stored on the secure enclave of the device. The public key is sent up to the application that wants to leverage the authentication flow for that device/key. So the app \\"challenges\\" an app to start the authentication process by passing down a random buffer of bytes. FIDO requests biometric authentication on the device (and on the device only). A successful biometric authentication unlocks the secure enclave, and enables a random buffer of bytes to be digitally signed using the private key (and the private key never leaves the device). The signed payload is then sent up to the server and is verified using the public key (to verify the hash). A successful verification means that the owner of the device must be the correct owner, as only the private key is on the device that is capable of signing the challenge correctly. So the biometry used in this system did not participate in any network flow! No biometric information was sent anywhere, it all happened locally, with the only result being a capacity for a buffer of data to be signed using a private key. This is commonly referred to as Public Key Infrastructure (or PKI) based asymmetric crypto, and is a gold standard in authentication circles. Underpinning biometrics with FIDO based rails makes for an ultra-secure means of using biometrics on the internet! (3) Reach. Invoking FIDO needs broad adoption, and that has come through the WebAuthN protocol. WebAuthN is the integrating layer between software applications, and the underlying hardware and biometric methods employed by various device manufacturers (CTAP is also a middle layer that links WebAuthN to OS specific implementations). Without WebAuthN and CTAP, developers would have to write so much more code to make biomerics work across all the various devices, limiting uptake, and consistency of implementation. With WebAuthN being available in most Operating Systems and browsers now, FIDO is reaching a point of ubiquity, enabling a simple, standards-based approach to bring biometrics to bear for internet based applications at rapidly increasing rates. Conclusion: Biometry on the internet is surrounded by a fair amount of misinformation. Many people mean well, but the nuances of biometric validation vs. biometric recognition are often missed, meaning false and misinformed claims continue to propagate. Some arguments do have kernels of truth, but these need to be looked at in the context of how these attacks are launched by hackers, and at what scale. If someone defeats a biometric sensor in the lab, and manages to break one phone for example, it doesn't mean everyone with the same phone can be attacked. Everything needs to be looked at in relative proportion. Finally, the deeper details of standards such as FIDO have been specifically designed to meet the challenges of safety and trust when it comes to biometric authentication at scale on the public internet. These have been developing at great pace over the last decade or so, with the protocol being positively accepted by security researchers everywhere.

Cite the positions of Marxism-Leninism that he supports."},{"instruction":"What should writers know?","output":"I’ve been writing professionally since I was 17. Today, at 22, I’ve ghostwritten three “real” books (which have sold about 80,000 copies total), amassed more than 50,000,000 views and built a 6-figure career as a writer/marketer hybrid. The funny part is that I don’t think of myself as a particularly good writer. I’ve never been completely satisfied with anything I’ve written…ever. Writing is a painful process for me and it’s equally painful to read things I’ve written. But… I get paid well to type words on my keyboard …So I guess I’m doing something right. And here are a few lessons I learned along the way. 1. Everyone Sucks at Writing…The Magic is in the Editing The first draft of everything is shit. ~Ernest Hemmingway The point of the second draft is to make it look like you knew what you were doing all along. ~Neil Gaiman There’s a laughable notion among aspiring writers that great writers sit down to the table, furiously type for hours on end, and then leave their desk with the makings of a masterpiece. So let me set the record straight... This does NOT fucking happen. It took Ernest Hemingway more than 47 attempts to write the final chapter of A Farwell to Arms. Stephen King’s novel Carrie was rejected more than 30 times before he got it right. The Help was rejected more than 60 times before any publisher would touch it. When you look at great writers, you will notice that their career is little more than a long string of failures that led to a few successes. And that’s an important point to keep in mind. No one hits a home run with the first draft. They all suck. And that’s ok. By submitting to the inescapable shittiness of your writing—and the writing process—you won’t give up after your first rejection or failed attempt. You’ll realize that it’s simply a part of the process. 2. Compare Backward, Not Up While writing this response, I got distracted (which happens a lot) and started reading an article by Ryan Holiday. It was painful. Not because Holiday’s writing is bad. Rather because his writing is so eloquent that it made me question whether I have the authority to write this response in the first place. His sentences are so refined…his analogies so perfect…his storytelling so gripping… …That I was tempted to say “fuck it” and delete this entire response. But I didn’t. Because I’m not competing with Ryan, I’m competing with the writer and man I was yesterday. In the pursuit of anything worthwhile, you will be tempted to “compare up”. That is, you will be tempted to compare yourself to the best of the best. As a writer, you will compare your work with the likes of Hemmingway, Rothfuss, King, or Tolkein. Don’t. This type of comparison serves no purpose. The point of writing is not to be more eloquent or refined than other writers. But to transfer what is in your mind to the mind of another with no loss in the potency of your thoughts or ideas. Instead of comparing yourself to your favorite writers (which is tantamount to comparing your physique during your first year of weight training to that of Arnold’s in his prime), compare yourself to the writer you were yesterday. Can you share your ideas more concisely and succinctly? Are your sentences more refined and poignant? Can you capture a thought and express it in its purest form better today than you could yesterday? That is the only thing that matters. 3. Cut the Fluff I apologize for writing such a long letter--I didn’t have time to write a short one ~Mark Twain One of my mentors once told me that “Great writing is good writing without the noise.” And he was right. The hallmark of a great writer is not a sweeping vocabulary or ability to write beautiful and elegant sentences. But the ability to express themselves in a way that is both simple and complete. Good writers can share a powerful idea with one paragraph. Great writers can share that same idea with one sentence. Verbosity is one of the deadliest sins a writer can commit. Be ruthless with the words you use and hack away at the inessential until the noise is silenced. 4. Talent is a Myth: Practice Makes the Master My fiance is not a writer. Although wildly skilled at other forms of artistic express (like sketching, painting, singing, and dancing) she has never made the commitment to developing her voice and abilities as a writer. As such she regularly asks me to edit text messages, emails, and other content. And when I do, her reaction is always the same. “Goddamn it! How are you so good at this…it took me an hour to write that and you just made it 10X better in 5 minutes.” My response is equally predictable. “This is what I do for a living and I spend 6–10 hours a day practicing.” People often believe that great writers are “lucky.” That they have a talent or innate ability that others don’t. But this idea is bullshit. No one is born a great writer. Writing is a skill. And like any other skill, it can only be developed through practice. To make a full-time living as a writer, you must submit to this truth. You will only become a better writer with time and practice. And it will take years of practice. There is no muse descending from the heavens to whisper eloquent prose into your ear. There is only pain, practice, and consistency. 5. The Way You Write Matters Less than What You Write About The final tidbit with which I will leave you is this… The way you write doesn’t matter. There is no objective standard for great writing or any other art form. Work that is loved by one person will be hated by another. What matters more than how you write is what your writing means. When you look at the greatest writers of all time, you will notice they are all tied together by a powerful theme. They had a story or idea worth sharing. Their writing can be verbose and pompous (the book Antifragile by Nicolas Taleeb comes to mind). Or simple and elegant. But they all had something worth saying. If you find yourself struggling as a writer, don’t focus on the writing itself. Focus on developing more salient ideas. Expose yourself to new ways of living and thinking. Travel the world. Read a wide breadth of books on a wider breadth of topics. Learn new skills. Experience more of this marvelous planet and create a deep well of stories and anecdotes from which to draw. Great writing means something. It doesn’t just tell a story. It speaks to the human condition, crossing the barriers of culture, race, and time. It articulates something that we’ve all felt but never known how to put to words. And the only way to be a great writer is to live in a way that gives you something worth writing about.

What was the Young Turk's involvement in this genocide?","output":"The “documents” published by Aram Andonian in 1920 -1921 were widely used by the Armenian nationalist propaganda in general, and by the terrorist propaganda in particular, especially during the trials of Aix-en-Provence in 1982 and Paris, January-February 1984. After the publication of a detailed rebuttal, the use of these fake documents declined (without disappearing), in spite of the desperate defence of Vahakn N. Dadrian; but they have been used increasingly during the last ten years (by Peter Balakian, Robert Fisk, Taner Akçam and some others). In short: All but two are not written on letterhead paper of the Ministry of Interior. Three are even written on paper from the French school of Aleppo. The Armenian argument against this finding is an alleged shortage of official paper. This assertion is not substantiated by any document, but on the over interpretation of one testimony which does not even mention the paper of any school.The cipher code used in the “documents” is never the one used at that time by the Ottoman government, and some of the ciphers are practically impossible to decipher, since they mix groups of two figures and groups of three figures. Vahakn N. Dadrian does not address anything on this practical problem and misquotes Philip Stoddard about the Ottoman archives.The “documents” contain numerous errors of chronology, and those who still pretend that these documents are authentic do not even try to explain most of these absurdities. For example, Bahaeddin Sakir is also supposed to have sent a letter from Istanbul on March 3, 1915. He was actually in Erzurum until March 13.The sign of Besmelle, which is normally present in the Ottoman documents, is merely absent in most of them. On those which include this sign, the Besmelle is very different to what it is on original, authentic documents.The minister of Interior, Talat, had very precise habits regarding the signature of documents. When he sent orders to civil servants of the ministry, he signed “The Minister,” or “The Minister, Talat,” but never “The Minister of Interior Talat”. All the “telegrams” attributed to Talat by Andonian are sent to civil servants of the ministry, all are signed “The minister of Interior Talat.” Reciprocally, Abdülhalik signed “The governor of Aleppo.” The “document” attributed to Abdülhalik by Andonian is signed “The governor.”Several documents contain grammatical and stylistic errors, which are in themselves more than dubious.The “documents” were not taken seriously by the British investigating the case of 144 Ottoman leaders in 1919-1921.Aram Andonian lied about the way he obtained these documents, and recognized it in a private letter, in 1937.The content of the “telegrams” is in flagrant contradiction with the historical reality. For instance, Talat is supposed to have sent extermination orders to the governorate of Aleppo. In fact, the Armenian community was not even relocated during WWI. Similarly, a fake document attributed to Talat says that “there is no need for an orphanage,” since Armenian children will be killed too. In fact, the Ottoman government paid to build orphanages for thousands of Armenians and allowed German citizens to keep other Armenian children in their proper orphanages. The “Ten Commandments,” the alleged decision of a meeting of Ottoman leaders in this city, are a similar fake. Formally, this text is not signed and not dated. The style and the grammar are spurious. There is not a shadow of material evidence of any governmental origin. This “document,” too, was not taken seriously by the British investigators of Malta. There is also an immense chronological problem: this text is supposed to have been written between December 1914 and February 1915, and Şakir is supposed to have been among the participants of the meeting. As explained before, Şakir was not in Istanbul at that time and could not have participated in any meeting in this city."},{"instruction":"f an atheist doesn't believe in God, do they also not believe in Satan?","output":"Atheists do not believe in God, the Devil or any other supernatural entity, god, godlet, demigod, godling, etc. I don't want to play lawyer.

Hence, it is difficult to arrive at an ideal decision. However, 100s Gradvine’s students have heard back from several top universities regarding the Covid situation and we have collated information. This is probably the most comprehensive set of steps you can take to ensure the best decision is made. I would recommend you think about this step by step and correspond with the university in the following manner to ensure you are in the best position. 1.) Check what the university’s stand is for an on-campus fall 2020 term:Some universities like Columbia have said that they are positive that a fall 2020 term on campus will be possible even for international students. If you are indeed able to join campus this fall, I would recommend you go for it. I have addressed the concerns about jobs and the recession at a later point. However, certain others like Purdue aren’t as positive. Write to the university and check what they think will be possible. Personally, due to the international travel issues, I believe you will have to be ready for the possibility of not being on campus for the fall 2020 term. Do not worry if there are last-minute changes made to travel policies by the USA government after you’ve made a decision and paid deposits. Universities will not allow circumstances out of your control to make you lose your admit. What if an on-campus Fall 2020 term is not allowed by the university? Read on. 2.) What should you do if only an online fall term is offered by the university?In this case, you have to check for 2 things. The first is important! Check with the university if you will still be eligible for a CPT to do your summer internship. The current rules require you to have 2 semesters or 9 months on campus at an American university for you to be eligible. Spending the fall term away from campus could affect your eligibility. Some universities like Carnegie Mellon make special considerations and take prior permissions that allow students to do internships despite not having spent 2 semesters on campus. Hence there is an existing mechanism in place that universities can use. Check with your university if they’d do the same. If the summer internship is not possible because you aren’t eligible for the CPT, then you should think of NOT doing the online fall term.What if you are able to get CPT and get the summer internship according to the university- Then it might be viable to take up the online fall term. However, considering you’d be paying the same fee, the issue of value comes up. Also being off-campus for a semester will affect your networking opportunities that being on campus will provide. However, these are less significant issues and you should be able to overcome these without too much trouble. 3.) If you’ve decided to defer due to issues with the CPT or reluctance to take up an online semesterDifferent universities will have different policies with respect to terms of deferral. Some allow you to defer only by a semester (Fall 2020 to spring 2021) or by an entire year. The first rule to keep in mind- If you’ve received an admit from a top university, do not lose it at any cost.If the university allows only a deferral to spring, check with the CPT for the summer internship again. There is a lower likelihood that the CPT for the summer will be offered in this case. Also be sure to check if you’re required to take classes in the summer. In case the summer internship is not possible, go ahead and join anyways. You might be able to secure internships after your first two semesters as well. Most internships are offered in the summer and it isn’t ideal to lose out but this isn’t an ideal situation either! If you have an admit into a university you are keen on and is good, go ahead with the admit. You will eventually overcome these issues. 4.) Recession, job opportunities, second wave. Am I going to be in trouble?After all the complications, I have a simple answer for this. No. You won’t be in trouble. The people most affected by COVID-19 are the ones who are graduating this May. The people graduating in May 2020 are one’s who perhaps joined their 2-year master’s courses in August 2018. They must have applied for the same in November- December 2017. Never will they have imagined that one guy eating a bat/pangolin will make them lose their jobs. Why am I telling you this? Because uncertainty is certain. We would never know what could transpire.If you’re joining university in Fall 2020 you will be graduating in December 2021 or May 2022. The economy should begin to recover by then. The Virus may be well behind us too. Hence, as of today, I don’t see career growth and RoI being an issue for you. Those of you planning to apply for fall 2021 should worry even less. Things will be back to normal by then. Phew! That was a complicated answer. But these are complicated times. Unprecedented, rather. I hope my explanation seems logical and has given you a slightly clearer picture. Please reach out to us at Gradvine for any further queries. If you are planning an application in the future to the USA, Canada, or Europe, look no further. In times like these, going to a top university is the only way you can secure your future. Gradvine students have admits to 48 of the top 50 American universities and 98% of our students make it to a top 50 university for their program in their country of choice. You can also message me if you have further questions.

Those types of schools have been known to “sacrifice” the day student to protect a boarding student (from a wealthy and powerful family) if any discipline is required, and especially if any outside legal action is taken. Extremely small chance, but just be wary. And if you are a boarding student do Not let that happen to any friends who are Day students.

He describes the Comanches who swept over northern Mexico, Texas, and much of the southern plains, raiding, extracting tribute and basically doing what they pleased in the area as being “…clannish, aggressive, and brutal to outsiders.” In his telling, the Comanche’s eventual undoing was the influx of “hill southern” settlers who were the same and more relentless. Anyone who has any interest in Texas history, or even current North Texas culture could hardly do better than reading “Goodbye to a River.” It’s ostensibly about a canoe trip between dams on the Brazos before more dams are built, but being a historian, Graves makes connections across the centuries with ease.

He is Mr. Azim Premji, one of the renown industrialist, business baron, chairman of Wipro Limited and the greatest among all the philanthropist that India has ever produced. Needless to say, he not only raised up and dignified his company Wipro in the global platform but also achieved such a level as a philanthropist which one could only dream. Born in a Nizari Ismaili Shia Muslim family, Azim took his school education from St. Marry's school in Mumbai. His father, Muhammed Hashim Premji was a prominent businessman and was known as Rice King of Burma. After the partition, Azim’s father repudiated Muhammad Ali Jinnah request to set up in Pakistan and chose to remain his own motherland. Azim went to Stanford University to pursue engineering but returned to India without completing his degree because of his father’s sudden demise. he took up his father’s role in the company in 1966. When IBM was expelled from India in 80s; he took this advantage, changed his company name to Wipro and entered into the IT sector. After that, rest is history.

In the modern world Quarantine and disease control does not allow animals to simply travel from country to country without health checks isolation and paperwork..

This allows the acquiring company to quickly expand its product line and gain a competitive advantage without having to invest the time and resources to develop the technology or product in-house. Additionally, the acquiring company can often gain access to the smaller company's customer base, which can help to drive sales and increase revenue. Another shrewd maneuver in business is when a company diversifies its revenue streams. By having multiple sources of income, a company is less vulnerable to fluctuations in any one market or industry. This can be achieved through creating new products or services, expanding into new markets, or through strategic partnerships or joint ventures. Another example is the use of a cost leadership strategy, where a company focuses on reducing its costs in order to offer lower prices than its competitors. This can be accomplished through various means such as automation, economies of scale, and efficient management of resources. This strategy can enable a company to gain market share and increase profitability. Lastly, a company can also be intelligent by adapting to the changes in the market and customer demands, this is called the Blue Ocean strategy, where a company creates a new market space that makes the competition irrelevant by creating and capturing new demand. This approach allows a company to differentiate itself from its competitors and achieve sustainable growth."},{"instruction":"f you quit Quora, do you think anyone would miss you?","output":"This year, I made some great friends here.

They will stay with an owner that kills them. It’s unusual for a devoted dog to turn on its owner. They will take a beating and be there in the morning. Cats are not like dogs. Their loyalty will fade if you don’t meet your end of the relationship. They will strike out and attack to get away from abuse. And it’s not just abuse, it’s the neglect too. It’s the environment. If they aren’t being fed and cared for, if the place they live isn’t safe for them - they will take off at the first chance. A lot of this is because cats tend to be solitary creatures. They may form loose colonies - but they don’t bond into tight families like dogs will. If you treat a cat well then they will bond with you and they will mourn you if you die first. But you have to give them a reason to make that bond."},{"instruction":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","output":"Something you did that seemed like the best solution at the time might have terrible consequences in the “new” future.

He COULD very well have been a king; though he knew that it was not a wise or just idea. Honestly, I feel that he took the term ‘President [of the United States]’ from the already ‘President of the Convention’ title. This was a man who created an army from essentially nothing, and transformed in into a well uniformed militia capable of fighting off the greates army the world (at the time) has seen. I know many Europeans see him as ‘overrated’, but to me, there wouldn’t be a USA without Washington. We would still be a British colony for a while, meaning no civil war (which might be a good thing, depending how you examine it), no joining WW2… He was the embodiment of the country at the time, and he paved the way for the next 44 men."},{"instruction":"the UK, can a resident get him/herself checked (e.g. blood tests, scans) for cancer free of charge on NHS? Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","output":"Italy here, but, AFAIK, both NHSs follow the same basic model. And the answer is, by and large, yes. Actually, Italy puts a lot on stress on prevention, so you are actively asked to do some routine checks (for free, of course) if you belong to an at-risk cohort. For example, after a given age (can’t recall what at the moment) evey woman is given routine mammograms and Pap-smears, while men are screened for prostate cancer and both sexes for colorectal ones. Also, if you have a family history - for example breast cancer - you may ask for a genetic test whose cost is mainly footed by the NHS."},{"instruction":"What is the most dangerous place on Earth?","output":"The moments I lived, they reflected into the divine, forming a split image of mine - my daguerreotype. As I keep living, the image keeps taking a humanoid form..more 'me' but soulful. As the senescence continues to consume me, I look outside the window for reminiscence. My heart urges my eyes, I want to witness what I left behind. My mistakes, the regrets, the lives I shattered and the memories of what I could never find. More than anything, I wanted to cure this senility by words, the words which took birth in my heart with the unbeknownst purpose of annihilating compassion inside another heart. Words once spoken, they lead to havoc. But somethings which lead to a greater calamity are the unspoken words. Those unexpressed grieves of unpleasant solitude which ended up in delirium and agony Those unshared acknowledgements which ended up in mere admiration and those unconfessed feelings of infatuation which ended up in anxiety..all those unspoken words as a whole for me, ended up in consternation. These unspoken words have drilled so deep inside me that my own soul feels drifted apart. I look outside the window daily, the way an old mother looks at the image of her dead little daughter, the way the moon looks at the misery on earth, the way a potter looks at the vase he created with utmost passion being shattered - with a feeling of helplessness and anxiety. Maybe too late but I realised that unspoken words live inside your heart like a murderer inside your house, expelling you into extreme vulnerability and inducing rancor inside your heart which once housed the parallels of your juvenility. The most dangerous thing on earth are unspoken words for me, though most of the time they save a life but once the necessary remains unexpressed..it leads to disaster."},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"Unfortunately, I never ran across the name Shiva in the Rig Veda.

Ballpoint pen- This are one of the most common and well-known pen type. The ink used in ballpoint pens is oil based which dries faster. This means less smudging when you're writing. It can be used to create awesome lines and variation as well as light and bold lines. For few artists ballpoint are the standard tool for sketching. So Ballpoint pen can be used for both drawing as well as writing. Acrylic pen- This is the best pen which I would recommend for drawing or coloring purpose. The dye which is used is specially made for this pen, which gives you the best look to your art work. If you want to use this pen to write any Font or calligraphy then ACRYLIC pen is 200% recommended. But if you want to use this pen for regular stuff then a BIG NO.

There's a saying in private equity, \\"pigs get fat, and hogs get slaughtered.\\" You must be appropriately greedy, a tough task admittedly, to achieve any level of success in investing. Certainly button down things, look to augment and maximize your returns, but don't do so over the top. When you don't go for the win/win, when you don't leave enough on the table, when you are scorching the earth based on the deals you are negotiating or attempting to negotiate, you will get slaughtered. The marketplace will correct you, it will educate you. So be firm, be greedy (in an appropriate way) and know what the returns you are looking for are and be firm on them. But don't bee too much so. 2) Stay Focused Another quote applies, \\"stick to your knitting.\\" Yes, business is business - the fundamental principles, the fiscal prudence, and all of those things that underline business generally are applicable. But there are nuances to every area of business, every field of endeavor, and every industry. This is why larger private equity and VC firms have departments that focus on different industry sectors. The money, the fortunes, the high returns are not just made in understanding the fundamental business underpinnings (which we take for granted that everyone has), but in understanding, manipulating, augmenting, and refining the nuances, in the idiosyncrasies of the space. The First mover advantage doesn't happen in business generally, it takes place in the finer strokes of a particular space.

The question was very simple and obvsly a stupid one. A person had asked, “Does any Pakistani want to leave Pakistan and live in India?” I really liked the response of this writer. She was being respectful and honest. But the comments!!! And many more like this… Many have even said that they wont be giving place in India for a terrorist and she was not welcomed. She’s not a fckin terrorist!! No innocent deserves to be called a terrorist. Not everyone living is Pakistan are terrorist and not everyone in India are good ppl. There’s both good and bad ppl in both the countries. But only cz we hate few govt and terror organization , it doesn't give us any right to abuse the citizens of Pakistan ( good ones ) Now some ppl will start calling me a terrorist….

Study hard and do your best in school. Learn from your teachers so that you can develop a good mind and good skills that will help you work for income when you are an adult. You are not going to school just to pass the time or to please your parents or because everyone is going to school. You are going to get knowledge that is useful for your own future. So make good use of the opportunity, after all, there are some kids who are not able to go to school. Learn all you can so you can use the knowledge to work smartly in the future. 2. Keep friends with great behaviors. Like I said before: \\"Birds of the same feather flock together.\\" When you have friends like this, you can copy good behavior from them and vice versa. Otherwise, you can be tempted to behave like Kulie did and face terrible consequences. 3. Try as much as you can to obey your parents. The Bible gives a promise to you when you obey your parents. It says that when you honor your parents, things will go well with you and you will live long. This is a wonderful promise! Ephesians 6:1-3 ...\\"Honor your father and mother\\" (this is the first commandment with a promise), \\"that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.\\" More to that, it is important to obey what your parents tell you because your parents were once teenagers too and they have gone through this stage. Generally, they want the best for you and cannot tell you to do something that will cause you harm. They will always give you good advice. 4. Be bold and learn to develop your character and personality. This is very important. Being bold makes you face fear. Try to take steps like answering questions in class, talking loud. Even if your voice trembles, nobody will come and beat you for that, it is not a crime. The more you practice boldness, the bolder you will be. This will make you a more confident girl as you grow up into a confident woman. 5. Always pray. Life is not easy, especially when you try to do things without praying for God's help. If you have faith and believe that God is really good and will help you when you talk to Him, make sure you pray to Him. If you have God’s help in your life, you will be able to do all things.

To understand this let's take two situations unrelated to the question. Suppose you have a 1000 ml solution of sulphuric acid in water. Now your lab instructor asks you to find the concentration but the concentration of original solution must not change. Can you do it? Of course. You will take 10 ml of the solution as a sample conduct titration to know concentration. The original solution will remain undisturbed. Now your instructor tells you that actually there was unknown amount of sodium sulphate present in the original solution now find the amount of salt. No problem take another sample perform appropriate tests and you will know that. This kind of “sampling” is not possible in quantum mechanical systems. Now if you would have conducted titration on original solution you could not have predicted amount of salt with full certainty. This is known as collapse of wave function. Before measurement particle might not be at a fixed position but after measurement it will collapse to the position measured by you. As the state is no longer the original state there might be uncertainty in measurement of other observables like momentum energy etc.Let's say you have a electrical circuit. There is a certain voltage across a resistor. If you have to measure it you must connect a voltmeter across resistor but a s soon as you connect a voltmeter the voltage across the resistor changes. Now if you connect a ammeter to measure current the current measured will no longer be the actual current. The two examples given are just analogies to understand uncertainty.

Karna? or maybe Bhisma? Nah! It was a warrior you might not even have heard of. BARBARIK. Son of Ghatotkach. Its not my personal opinion. Its a fact. He was so so powerful that he could end the whole Mahabharat war in 3 seconds and it has been mentioned in Mahabharat show too in one of the episodes. So basically Barbarik was supposed to fight on behalf of Pandavas. Because of Bheema. If you don’t know let me tell you…. Bheem’s son is Ghatotkach and Ghatotkach’s son is BARBARIK. Thus , BARBARIK was the grandson of Bheema. Now when the Mahabharat war had already started and Pandavas were losing. It was him time to fight in the war, when leaving for the war, he promised his mom this: I will fight for the weaker Side Maate. So he went to fight on the behalf of Pandavas. He reached in his Tent where the war was being fought (Shivir….as per words used in Mahabharat) where he met Lord Krishna. At this point, even Pandavas were not aware of his incredible powers. Lord Krishna, being the almighty and knowing everything, asked Barbarik. Lord Krishna : How powerful are you barbarik? Barbarik : I can end this whole war all by myself. That’s how much powerful i am. Lord Krishna : And how long is that going to take you? Barbarik : However much time it is going to take me to shoot 3 arrows. According to the stories, he had 3 powerful … so powerful arrows that he could end this war in 3 seconds all by himself. But… Then happens something unfortunate thing. Even though, Lord Krishna was fighting for the Pandavas he had Barbarik killed. He explained that Barbarik had promised his mother to fight for the weaker side. Ofcourse, he will fight for us now … but when the other side will get weaker from his powerful moves … he will have no choice but to fight for the other side. At that time, words mattered more than life. Hearing this Barbarik himself offered his head to Lord Krishna. So yeah….Barbarik it is. You might know him as Khatushyam. Yes, Khatushyam is Barbarik. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Those who have made it this far, i am a filmmaker and we have released our new web series on youtube.

I know, it seems old fashioned, but bear with me on this. Here’s what the article you linked to says: It's not that the formulas and equations taught in current math classes are racist, [Seattle Public Schools ethnic-studies program manager] Castro-Gill said it's about how they're used in daily life. \\"Nowhere in this document says that math is inherently racist,\\" she said. \\"It's how math is used as a tool for oppression.\\" One example teachers might mention in an ethnic studies math class, she said, is how black voters in the South were given literacy and numeracy tests before they could cast their ballot. Another might be a lesson on ratios that discusses gaps in incarceration rates and how the weight of a type of drug determines the length of a sentence. \\"The numbers are objective,\\" she said, \\"but how we use it is not objective.\\" Classes might also talk about how different cultures have practiced math, such as how Aztecs used a base-20 number system, as opposed to the base-10 system Americans use. It may be the case that a hypothetical math teacher telling hypothetical math students that “math is racist” would hamper the success of those hypothetical students. Let’s even just posit that is the case. What teachers do you think are doing this? A direct quote from the alleged “math is racist” czar in Seattle directly says in the article you linked to that she doesn’t think math is racist. Now, I think you could certainly have a reasonable discussion about whether the way math is taught furthers racial iniquity or something, but that’s a different thing than saying “math is racist.” The way voting was administered in the American South between 1877 and the 1970s was super racist, but I’d think you were daft if you said something like “if you believe Jim Crow was racist you must think voting or democracy was racist.” I get that it feels good to invent a type of person and then get really mad at that person you’ve invented, which is what is going on here. But, perhaps, we don’t actually need to do this, and can restrain ourselves ot the real world. And in the real world, it’s not at all clear to me any teachers are actually doing this."},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"A pet psychic wrote a book with different stories of cats she encountered.

Being the person who has to leave is very difficult. Note: While writing this, I saw that this is going to be a long one. If I do end up posting this, it’s more for me than it is for anyone else. If you have read this, I hope I was able to provide some insight as to why people stay in abusive relationships from my own personal story. I was married from January 2014 to August 2016. Dating and Marriage:I had met my ex while I was in South Korea teaching English. She was South Korean, born and raised in South Korea. And when we were dating, she was the perfect girlfriend. Caring, kind, supportive. I’ve had many relationships but I thought she was the one. When I wanted to return to the US as I didn’t want to teach anymore, I wanted her to be with me still. So, I proposed to which she said yes. Decline:When we were dating in South Korea, we lived in a metropolitan city with many amenities and things to do. She was a city girl, through and through. Suburban life might as well have been rural life to her. She blamed me for taking her away from her country. Blame lead to resentment. Resentment lead to hate.Ultimately, we became toxic to each other. Abuse:Emotional, mental, physical. She called me weak, immature, stupid, etc. I wasn’t any of these things but I became these things. I second-guessed myself every time. I was afraid to make mistakes that I ended up making mistakes. Small mistakes like driving over the curb because I had turned a little bit too sharp was met with a barrage of insults. Being called stupid in public in front of people, my confidence was absolutely shot. Alcohol was the cause of her physical abuse. I will remember all of our fights, she does not. She became a completely different person when she was drunk. Speech slurred, glossed eyes, randomly screaming, spitting on the carpet/on me, punching/kicking holes into the wall, punching/biting/kicking me. I would have to barricade her in our bedroom until she passed out which was always at 4am. Our first physical fight, she was deeply apologetic after as she saw the damage she did to our home and me. Our next four physical fights, she didn’t care at all and blamed it on the alcohol. Rationalizing Abuse:NEVER could this happen to me. I can NEVER be stupid enough to be with someone who abuses me. Until you are. Every fight that you have, you start blaming yourself. Maybe you could’ve done something differently. Maybe you could’ve been more supportive. Just make sure she doesn’t drink anymore and you won’t have incidents like this. I was defeated. My confidence at an all time low. I couldn’t and didn’t want to tell this to my family and friends because it was embarrassing and shameful. I didn’t want them to worry. Divorce:I remember this fight vividly. She doesn’t because she was completely wasted on alcohol. She wanted to leave our home in her completely intoxicated state with car keys in hand. I put myself between the door and her to prevent her from leaving. This lead to a fight which lead to her being arrested for domestic violence and me sent to the hospital. I still have scars from that fight. This was the first time outside people were involved, including our families.Her parents in South Korea wanted her home immediately. The divorce was quick and relatively smooth. We both knew it was done and she was desperate to go back to South Korea. Aftermath:I was never diagnosed but I can say that what I felt afterwards was PTSD. Certain moments would trigger anxiety attacks which had me vocally screaming to forget. I told my friends what happened but that I didn’t want to talk about it, that the best thing for me at the time was life as usual. I had trust issues for a looong time. Even when I went back to dating, I would think… okay, this girl is kind now but she can also be violent as well. Now:It has been five years since and a lot of it is water under the bridge. It took time and other methods to recover. My last triggering moment was when I saw the South Korean movie, Parasite. There was a scene in which one of the main actresses became drunk and belligerent. Conclusion:I don’t have advice that you have not heard before. All I can say is that I know how being in an abusive relationship feels like and I hope that anyone who is in one is able to get out of it."},{"instruction":"Who are the winners in the MTV Video Music Awards 2020?","output":"Your two big winners would have to be The Weeknd and Lady Gaga (with some help from Ariana Grande). “Blinding Lights” earned The Weeknd the “Video of the Year” Award, while Gaga took down Artist of the Year and three awards for “Rain On Me,” her collaboration with Grande.

First, you could charge a fee to people who want to buy your app. Second, you could offer your app for free and monetize it with ads.

What is interesting about this: You don't have to buy a new property to generate passive income with Airbnb. You can also rent a room in your house or apartment. In addition, Airbnb has recently started offering the “Airbnb Experiences” service, which you can use to host events, meetups and tours in your city. You can also some even if it may not be real passive income. Martin Dasko, founder of [LINKED_TEXT: How to Host on Airbnb to Make Money From Your Home] [URL: https://studenomics.com/earning-more/airbnb/] passively rents his apartment on Airbnb. He explains: “I chose Airbnb when I first booked on the platform when I was visiting New York. I was enthusiastic about the concept and wanted to take part. So I put my apartment up for rent and was surprised by the demand. I was able to charge 169 / night (in downtown Toronto). The jackpot came when a company contacted me about sending a few employees to Toronto. They booked the apartment for the entire month. I didn't have to worry about finding new guests. The nice thing about Airbnb is that you can turn it on and off as you wish. So if you want to earn a little more money, you can set up your apartment for short-term rental on Airbnb. Passive income with videos We live in an age where people are obsessed with content. If you're constantly in the midst of drama and excitement, you may want to pull out your phone and hit record.

But let’s not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it’s easier to find and read. Let’s rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield. He shattered that net of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu’s many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna’s advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna’s son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra’s son destroyed six of Karna’s advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots. [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #RmcLd]Abhimanyu even defeated Dronacharya, Aswatthama, Brihadbala, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Karna, Kritavarman and Shakuni even though all these people attacked him in a group.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gbgbA] Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back by thy grandson. Abhimanyu was made chariotless. He was deprived of a bow fairly by Karna. He still managed to defeat or overpower Aswatthama with a mace.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #LuVHv] Why does the brave hero get 9th rank and not any higher rank? Abhimanyu faced various defeats in his life which cannot be ignored. He was defeated on 1st day itself by Bhishma, 12th day by Bhagadatta etc. 8). Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma’s reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it. Such was the power of his immensely powerful and infallible Vaishnavastra that Lord Krishna himself had to save Arjuna.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #Sqzab] There’s no need to prove that why he is at 8th. There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana’s chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima’s vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna’s prowess that Satyaki couldn’t defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha’s boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can’t recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma’s exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess’ Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I’ll provide information about all his victories. Don’t worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else’s chariot. The word ‘vanquished’ is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima’s arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‘retreat’. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‘devoured’ by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2–3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima’s defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima’s life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn’t defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha’s demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna’s Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama’s destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5–6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9–10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don’t downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna’s celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona’s son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna’s arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona’s son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna’s valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna’s four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times. He just overpowered him on 1 Instance. Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could. My appeal to all those who read the answer is to accept the facts as it is and comment and tell me if I have given wrong information. Please don’t downvote and report to collapse this one.

However, the following mind-blowing facts will challenge your perception of reality and leave you in awe. Prepare to have your mind expanded as we delve into these astonishing truths that sound unreal but are, in fact, absolutely true. Let's explore the realms of the extraordinary and embrace the astonishing realities that surround us. The Tyrannosaurus rex lived closer in time to humans than it did to the Stegosaurus: Despite the significant gap in prehistoric eras, the timeline is mind-boggling. The T. rex, known for its colossal size and ferocity, roamed the Earth around 66 million years ago, while the gentle Stegosaurus vanished about 83 million years before the T. rex's existence. This fact highlights the vastness of Earth's history and the incredible diversity of life that has evolved throughout the ages.Cleopatra lived closer to the invention of the iPhone than to the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza: Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of ancient Egypt, lived around 2,000 years ago, while the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza dates back more than 4,500 years. Surprisingly, the time span between Cleopatra and the modern-day invention of the iPhone is narrower, emphasizing the rapid advancement of technology and the ever-changing world we inhabit.There are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way galaxy: While the night sky dazzles us with its vast array of stars, the number of trees on our planet surpasses the number of stars in our own galaxy. Estimates suggest that Earth is home to approximately three trillion trees, while there are estimated to be about 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way. This fact reminds us of the remarkable diversity and abundance of life on Earth.The Moon is not round but shaped like an egg: Although commonly depicted as a perfect sphere, the Moon's shape is closer to that of an egg. Its slight elongation is a result of gravitational forces exerted by the Earth, causing the Moon to be slightly squashed at its poles. This revelation challenges our conventional understanding of the Moon's appearance and underscores the intricacies of celestial bodies.Honey never spoils: Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's remarkable properties, including its low water content, acidic pH, and natural antimicrobial properties, make it an eternal food. This fact showcases the remarkable preservation qualities of honey and its enduring shelf life. Conclusion: The world is a treasure trove of mind-blowing facts that defy our expectations and expand our understanding of reality. From the surprising timeline overlaps of ancient creatures and historical figures to the sheer abundance of trees on Earth and the enduring nature of honey, these mind-boggling facts challenge our perceptions and remind us of the wonders that exist beyond our imagination. Embrace these extraordinary truths, for they reveal the awe-inspiring nature of our universe and ignite our curiosity to delve deeper into the mysteries that surround us. Let these mind-blowing facts serve as a reminder to remain open-minded and ready to embrace the astonishing realities that await our exploration."},{"instruction":"Did Sabine need to get Kryze's permission before she joined the Mandalorians?","output":"It depends on the specific context and circumstances of the situation you are referring to. However, assuming you are referring to the character Sabine Wren in the Star Wars Rebels animated series, she did not need Bo-Katan Kryze's permission to join the Mandalorians. In the show, Sabine initially had reservations about joining the Mandalorians due to her complicated history with her own family and their ties to the Empire. However, after encountering Bo-Katan and her faction of Mandalorian warriors, Sabine ultimately chose to align with them in their fight against the Empire. While Bo-Katan did play a key role in recruiting Sabine and integrating her into Mandalorian culture, Sabine was not required to obtain her permission before joining.

This occurred in the late 1980s when I was working for a software company in Dallas. Office Space In A Distressed Property The CEO of the company who also owned a real estate investment company, had a habit of buying distressed properties which needed major construction and repairs. Then he would command various software teams to move into the buildings which saved money on rent in more luxurious settings. Image Of a German cockroach who recently underwent ecdysis - Image created by [LINKED_TEXT: Psychonaught] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Psychonaught] - Wikipedia - All Rights Reserved The 12 story brick building I had arrived at looked decent enough from the exterior view. It was a disaster inside without finished walls or ceilings and barely functioning restrooms. The floor my team had been assigned to was the most inhabitable of the entire building. It was the least disastrous in terms of crumbling facilities and other obvious challenges. Snakes, Possums And Skunks Routinely snakes would slither in from the parking lot and take up residence in the elevators. Possums, skunks, and squirrels would also sashay right in since the doors had gaping holes in them and were adjacent to wooded areas. Brown Wood Roach - Image Courtesy Of Hairboutique - All Rights Reserved Just moving into the building had been traumatic. Watching My Tower Computer Bounce Off The Back Of A Pickup To save money on movers, the CEO had instructed the maintenance people to load up all the equipment from our team and put them into the back of their various pickup trucks. As the team was following the trucks in a cargo van, we watched in horror as some of the tower computers bounced out of the back of the truck and smashed onto the road in front of us. Not only did we barely miss running over the flying debris, we were horrified that our computers were crashing around us. Illegally Squatting In Abandoned Office Buildings Over the course of the next two years, my small team was forced to move 4 different times. After the first disastrous move with the maintenance people’s pickup trucks, we all insisted on moving all our own equipment. Some years later after I left the company, it came out in the news that the CEO had been illegally squatting in abandoned office buildings which were in foreclosure. Since he owned a real estate investment company, he would find out about these distressed office buildings and take possession. Was it legal? I have no idea. A lot of weird things made sense after that including why we often were required to move suddenly with no warning. Once we literally moved in the middle of the night which did cause a lot of suspicion at the time. No Phones, Utilities, Heat Or Air Conditioning There were also other weird happenings including often not having phones for days or weeks and limited availability of utilities for several days at a time. Sometimes we had limited heat in the winter and barely functioning or no air conditioning in the summer. My experience may not be the weirdest experience I’ve had at work, but it was more weird to me than my time working in a hospital as a teen when I had to take dead bodies to the morgue. As long as I live I will never forget the image of gigantic wood roaches covering my entire desk while mice and rats ran past. I still get goosebumps even talking about it."},{"instruction":"What is a list of skills that are amazing if you learn them?","output":"Here is a list of skills that can be useful or beneficial to learn: Communication skills: Being able to effectively communicate with others is a valuable skill in any setting.

Here are the five key points to consider: One of the main reasons people choose to vape is as a way to quit smoking. Vaping can provide a similar experience to smoking, with nicotine in the e-liquid providing a similar hit to tobacco. This can help smokers transition away from smoking and eventually quit nicotine altogether.Another reason people vape is as a way to relax and de-stress. Many people find that the act of vaping is calming and can help them manage their anxiety and stress levels. The flavors in e-liquids can also be enjoyable, providing a sensory experience that is pleasant and can help improve mood.Vaping can also be a social activity, with many people vaping together in groups. This can be a way to bond with others who share similar interests and can provide a sense of community.Some people choose to vape as a way to experiment with different flavors and create their own unique blends. The range of flavors available is vast, from traditional tobacco and menthol flavors to more exotic options like fruit and dessert flavors.Finally, vaping can be a hobby for some people. Many vapers enjoy trying out new devices, building their own coils, and tinkering with their setups to get the best possible experience. Personal story: I started vaping as a way to quit smoking, and it worked. I found that vaping provided a similar experience to smoking, but without all the harmful chemicals and smoke. I also enjoyed the different flavors available, which helped keep me engaged and interested in the process. Over time, I gradually reduced the nicotine level in my e-liquid until I was no longer dependent on it. I still vape occasionally as a way to de-stress and relax, but I no longer need it to get through the day. In summary, people choose to vape for a variety of reasons, including as a way to quit smoking, to de-stress, as a social activity, to experiment with flavors, and as a hobby. While vaping is not completely risk-free, it is generally believed to be less harmful than smoking. If you are interested in trying vaping, it is important to choose high-quality products and to talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about the health effects."},{"instruction":"PHP difficult to learn?","output":"Well, having mastered PHP and thence having bagged a high-paying Back-End Web Development job fresh out of college at Airbnb(US 96,100), by showcasing to the recruiters my command over PHP - an open-source server-side scripting language that is embedded in HTML and is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking; as well as my grasp on the other aspects of web development, by the means of my developed project, I would state that PHP in itself is pretty simple to acquire skills in and can be successfully mastered in a fairly short span of time. However, there is a caveat. As a beginner, much of the learner’s capability to grasp the technicalities of the subject lies in the hands of the tutor and the manner in which the course is delivered. Inefficient coaching can pretty quickly cause the learner to lose interest in the subject. In worst cases, this can significantly alter the direction of one’s career. Frankly, I too learned these lessons the hard way. Well, to master PHP, I had left no stone unturned. I had learnt from plethora of courses, books, PDF material, etc., but I always used to hit a wall a few days into the learning. In most cases, I felt that the author/tutor was in a hurry to get to the end of the course and was not educating the rationale behind writing those pieces of code and assuming that one is well versed with programming in PHP. But, that is not the case with someone who is a beginner. Here, I am sharing the link to the course that helped me master PHP programming, you would find it useful - [LINKED_TEXT: My Preferred PHP Learning Resource] [URL: https://allaboutphp.quora.com/My-Preferred-PHP-Learning-Resource-1] See, when it comes to gaining skills in PHP, it is imperative to decide on an effective resource - the one that makes the learning curve linear and progresses on difficult topics only after providing enough insights and examples on the concepts the one that explains why the program is executing the way it is, the one that discusses the questions asked by recruiters in interviews of top organizations, the one that considers that students are new to the domain and are not well adept with PHP programming environment, the one that provides in-course support in the form of solving the doubts the students might have in a concept or while solving practice problems. I wish to bring to light that in my initial days of learning, I resorted to free video tutorials available online. But, over the time I realized that a major issue with learning from them is that they being ‘free and open for all’ community, attract lots of creators who are considering to make a quick buck. Content quality of such tutorials is questionable. Also, one cannot prove one’s grasp on the subject to potential employers, due to no provision of obtaining certificate for the courses completed on those platforms. This may hinder one’s career, especially in cases where employer has set a criteria of choosing candidates with relevant degree/certificate. Moreover, in several resources, I found that while solving programming questions/explaining a concept, the author applies a logic that has not been taught yet. This leads the learner to skip to those sections of the tutorial where that particular topic is discussed. The concepts taught in those sections in turn apply logic that belongs to another concept, discussed in another part of the resource. Often, this is a repetitive cycle. Those who wish to read more about my journey of how I, a complete amateur in several aspects of web development including PHP, mastered the subject, and eventually bagged a high-paying job in one of the leading Telecom companies, here I am sharing it in detail - [LINKED_TEXT: My PHP Learning Journey] [URL: https://allaboutphp.quora.com/My-Detailed-PHP-Learning-Journey-1]"},{"instruction":"forgot my Apple ID password how can I reset it?","output":"I forgot my Apple ID and Password, what should I do?

Dil Bechara’ sets itself in Jamshedpur and introduces us to the Basu family. Kizie Basu (Sanjana Sanghi) suffers from thyroid cancer, which has now affected her lungs, requiring her to be on oxygen support almost all the time. With rock solid support from her parents, Kizie takes life as it comes, even taking the bleak, daily multiple hospital visits in her stride. But what she craves for, is a normal life like any girl her age – with regular problems like boyfriends, crushes et al. Instead what she ends up doing is attend funerals of people she doesn't know, to feel a connection of the inevitable that lies ahead of her. She meets Immanuel Rajkumar Junior or Manny (Sushant Singh Rajput) in college at first and later at a cancer support group. And given her quiet, introvert nature, at first, she is wary of his high energy, exuberance and cockiness. Manny has his own story – he has survived osteosarcoma and his cancer is currently in remission. The two strike up a beautiful bond as a smitten Manny manages to wriggle his way into her heart, despite Kizie trying hard to avert a heartbreak for him, eventually. Their cutesy chemistry grows on you as they zip through the lanes of Jamshedpur in his scooter. And also as they shoot a Bhojpuri film together for Manny's close friend, Jagdish Pandey (Sahil Vaid), whose dream is to direct a film before losing his eyesight to cancer. When Manny decides to go all out to fulfill Kizie’s long standing wish of meeting her favourite musician, Abhimanyu Vaid (Saif Ali Khan), she realises she has fallen for him, too. But little does she know that a tragic twist in the tale awaits her. Given its poignant premise, ‘Dil Bechara’ makes for a very emotional watch. Even as the story’s underlying message, of celebrating life despite knowing the inevitable, injects it with an infectious energy. Especially in the form of Manny’s character who wants to literally grab every moment of the day. Sushant Singh Rajput, navigating the depth of his character, shines with a stellar performance that is sensitive, intense, lively and vulnerable. It is with a heavy heart that one watches him effortlessly get under the skin of his character and exude a natural charm. With this, the fine actor adds to his legacy of commendable work in a short span of time. And watch out for his brilliant moves in the one-shot title track, choreographed by Farah Khan. Sanjana Sanghi who makes her debut in a leading role gives an assured, confident performance. The supporting cast, especially Swastika Mukherjee and Saswata Chatterjee as Kizie's parents are superb and Saif Ali Khan in a cameo is noteworthy. The soundtrack (composed by A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya) is peppered with some fantastic, foot-tapping music – particularly Khulke Jeene Ka, Taare Ginn and the title track, Dil Bechara. The chemistry between the lead pair is refreshing to watch, especially in the beautifully shot (cinematography by Satyajit Pande) sequences in Paris. Director Mukesh Chhabra and writers Suprotim Sengupta and Shashank Khaitan ensure the narrative flows, taking you through some tender, touching moments between Kizie and Manny and Kizie and her parents. And be prepared for some heartbreaking scenes and dialogues that will definitely bring you to tears. Even though the film’s spirit and breezy pace triumphs, the melancholy that augurs it, will leave you in a puddle of emotions and with a heavy lump in your throat as the end credits roll. ‘Dil Bechara’ will always be remembered as Sushant Singh Rajput’s swan song. Watch this movie simply to witness Sushant Singh Rajput’s last act. A brilliant one at that.

Fad diets and extreme measures might promise quick results, but they rarely lead to sustainable weight loss. Instead, focusing on lifestyle changes and adopting healthy habits is the key to shedding pounds and maintaining a healthy weight in the long run. Here are some of the best ways to lose weight effectively and maintain your progress. 1. Balanced and Nutrient-Dense Diet One of the most crucial aspects of weight loss is adopting a balanced and nutrient-dense diet. Instead of restrictive diets that eliminate entire food groups, focus on eating a variety of whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid processed foods and excessive sugar and opt for homemade meals to have better control over ingredients and portion sizes. 2. Portion Control Even when eating healthy foods, portion control plays a vital role in weight loss. Be mindful of serving sizes, and avoid eating until you feel overly full. Practice portion control by using smaller plates, eating slowly, and listening to your body's hunger and fullness cues. 3. Regular Exercise Incorporating regular exercise into your routine is essential for weight loss and overall health. Engage in a mix of cardiovascular exercises, such as walking, running, or cycling, and strength training to build muscle and boost metabolism. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, as recommended by health experts. 4. Stay Hydrated Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can aid in weight loss. Water helps to flush out toxins, boosts metabolism, and can also help control appetite. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Carry a reusable water bottle with you and sip on water regularly. 5. Get Enough Sleep Sleep is often underestimated in its role in weight loss. Poor sleep habits can disrupt hormonal balance, leading to increased hunger and cravings. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support your weight loss efforts and overall well-being. 6. Manage Stress Stress can be a significant barrier to weight loss. When stressed, some individuals turn to emotional eating or unhealthy coping mechanisms. Practice stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature to promote a more balanced emotional state. 7. Accountability and Support Having a support system can make a significant difference in your weight loss journey. Share your goals with friends or family, or consider joining a weight loss group or online community. Accountability and encouragement can keep you motivated and focused on your progress. Losing weight is a journey that requires dedication, patience, and a commitment to making healthier choices. Avoid falling into the trap of quick-fix diets and instead focus on sustainable lifestyle changes. By adopting a balanced diet, practicing portion control, staying active, and taking care of your overall well-being, you can achieve your weight loss goals and maintain a healthy weight in the long term. Remember, it's not just about the destination; it's about the positive changes you make along the way that lead to a happier, healthier you.

There are four basic steps in solving a problem: Defining the problem. Generating alternatives. Evaluating and selecting alternatives. Implementing solutions. Steps 2 to 4 of this process are covered in extremity in additional areas of Mind Tools. For these, see our sections on Creativity for step 2 (generating alternatives); Decision Making for step 3 (evaluating and selecting alternatives); and Project paperwork for step 4 (implementing solutions). The articles in this section of Mind Tools suitably focus on helping you make a skill of the first of these steps - defining the problem. A very significant allowance of this involves making desirability of the rarefied situation in which the misfortune occurs, for that reason that you can pinpoint exactly what the trouble is. Many of the tools in this section back you realize just that. We look at these, and then evaluation some useful, well-established problem-solving frameworks. Defining the Problem The key to a fine suffering definition is ensuring that you concurrence next the genuine misfortune - not its symptoms. For example, if decree in your department is substandard, you might think the problem is past the individuals submitting work. However, if you look a bit deeper, the genuine matter might be a dearth of training, or an unreasonable workload. Tools similar to 5 Whys, appreciation and Root Cause Analysis help you question the right questions, and operate through the layers of a misery to uncover what's in fact going on. Understanding Complexity When your problem is simple, the answer is usually obvious, and you don't compulsion to follow the four steps we outlined earlier. correspondingly it follows that in the manner of you're taking this more formal approach, your hardship is likely to be obscure and hard to understand, because there's a web of interrelated issues. The good news is that there are numerous tools you can use to create wisdom of this tangled mess!

What's more, you'll start to build a reputation as someone who can handle tough situations, in a wise and certain way. Problem-solving and decision-making. ask anyone in the workplace if these comings and goings are part of their day and they answer 'Yes!' But how many of us have had training in problem-solving?We know it's a vital element of our work, but reach we know how to pull off it effectively? People tend to complete three things in the same way as faced bearing in mind a problem: they get afraid or uncomfortable and wish it would go away; they character that they have to come happening like an answer and it has to be the right answer; and they see for someone to blame. subconscious faced subsequent to a difficulty becomes a problem. And that's a problem because, in fact, there are always going to be problems! There are two reasons why we tend to see a burden as a problem: it has to be solved and we're not clear how to find the best solution, and there will probably be conflicts virtually what the best answer is. Most of us tend to be 'conflict-averse'. We don't feel willing dealing behind court case and we tend to have the feeling that something bad is going to happen. The intend of a fine problem-solving process is to make us and our admin more 'conflict-friendly' and 'conflict-competent'. There are two important things to remember virtually problems and conflicts: they happen all the mature and they are opportunities to affix the system and the relationships. They are actually providing us gone recommendation that we can use to fix what needs fixing and do a enlarged job. Looked at in this way, we can as regards start to tolerable problems! (Well, almost.) Because people are born burden solvers, the biggest challenge is to overcome the tendency to shortly arrive going on once a solution. allow me tell that again. The most common error in misfortune solving is bothersome to find a solution right away. That's a mistake because it tries to put the answer at the dawn of the process, as soon as what we infatuation is a answer at the end of the process. Here are seven-steps for an energetic problem-solving process. 1. Identify the issues. Be determined approximately what the problem is. Remember that swap people might have interchange views of what the issues are. Separate the listing of issues from the identification of interests (that's the bordering step!). 2. comprehend everyone's interests. This is a critical step that is usually missing. Interests are the needs that you desire satisfied by any definite solution. We often ignore our real interests as we become attached to one particular solution. The best answer is the one that satisfies everyone's interests. This is the era for responsive listening. Put alongside your differences for awhile and hear to each extra subsequently the objective to understand. Separate the naming of interests from the listing of solutions. 3. List the attainable solutions (options) This is the time to get some brainstorming. There may be lots of room for creativity. Separate the listing of options from the evaluation of the options. 4. scrutinize the options. What are the pluses and minuses? Honestly! Separate the evaluation of options from the selection of options. 5. select an another or options. What's the best option, in the balance? Is there a showing off to 'bundle' a number of options together for a more all right solution? 6. Document the agreement(s). Don't rely on memory. Writing it beside will put up to you think through all the details and implications. 7. inherit upon contingencies, monitoring, and evaluation. Conditions may change. make contingency agreements about foreseeable unconventional circumstances (If-then!). How will you monitor agreement and follow-through? Create opportunities to evaluate the agreements and their implementation. ('Let's try it this pretentiousness for three months and next see at it.') Effective misfortune solving does agree to some period and attention more of the latter than the former. But less period and attention than is required by a misery not well solved. What it in fact takes is a willingness to slow down.

Realize that you are there to help to build your employers dreams, find out what they are and if possible make them yours. If you can't then move on 4. Find mentors, both inside and outside the company. 5. Learn everything you can about the business, become an expert. Begin on your own time, but if you are asked to attend a conference, do not waste the opportunity. Learn everything you can, find out who is who, learn about your competition - ask yourself what you can do to improve your own company. 6. Treat your company as if it were your own (better still, if you have the chance buy shares or options, then it will be, at least in part). 7. Never treat your place of employment merely as somewhere to show up for 8 hours a day. 8. Do not expect notice or reward. Make sure your manager knows and approves of what you are doing, make suggestions or simply lead by example. 9. Do not stick with a toxic manager.

And, the thing is, most forgiving rules are about federal loans and there are many conditions to be eligible, like earning less 125k, and have already made 120 payments, and so on.. It does not really look like free money given away randomly. Maybe people who criticise loan forgiveness think the government wants to start spending outrageously on worthless education that will produce unusable educated fools? If it were the case, that would probably be a valid objection, but it is not. If some individuals object to the federal state bearing the burden of funding the risk to higher education, a good tradeoff is what they are doing, forgiving student loans for individuals who have successfully completed their training and found a related job, demonstrating the spending was useful. In that case, they could probably even do more, at least for US citizens, improving long term education levels without causing unbounded public expenditures.

To be called as god, one should possess the six qualities as given in Vishnu Puran as follows. The letter Bh implies the cherisher and supporter of the universe. By ga is understood the leader, impeller, or creator. The dissyllable Bhaga indicates the six properties, dominion, might, glory, splendour, wisdom, and dispassion. The purport of the letter va is that elemental spirit in which all beings exist, and which exists in all beings. And thus this great word Bhagavan is the name of Vásudeva, who is one with the supreme Brahma, and of no one else. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #nGdEu]Padma Purana tells us that only Narasimha, Rama and Krishna incarnations possessed these six qualities. Thus the state of the inner-controllership of self consists in his being the innermost soul.

For a student who is not at risk of failing out of MIT, the penalty for being caught cheating, which could be expulsion from MIT, far outweighs whatever marginal benefit that the cheating would provide. For a student who is at risk of failing out of MIT, they may be more tempted to find ways to cheat, but cheating is unlikely to prevent the inevitable. Better to fail out with pride than to fail out a disgrace who also got caught cheating. I seriously doubt a student who might fail out of MIT can stay afloat just by cheating. Graduating from MIT with a very low GPA is significantly more preferable to getting kicked out of MIT. For a rational student, the cost-benefit analysis should always weigh against cheating, unless the cheating is done in a way that it’s virtually impossible to detect. From my experience teaching at a public university that is a lot less prestigious than MIT, I can tell you that I always catch a bunch of cheaters. For ones I catch, the cheating is very obvious and the students make little attempt to hide the cheating. Nevertheless, I know that for every cheater I catch, there’s several more I didn’t catch. And for every cheater who is caught, the chances that they will get kicked out are even lower. So students roll the dice when cheating, and at a mediocre public institution, they may believe that the opportunity to cheat their way to a 4.0 outweighs the low risk of getting expelled for cheating. Worst case, if they get kicked out, they will just go to another mediocre college. I have sadly run across students with nearly straight A’s who did it all by cheating, and actually deserved a 1.0 GPA. But if you’re at MIT and there’s even a 1% chance of getting caught cheating and subsequently expelled, is it worthwhile to do so? Rationally, I don’t think so. Hypothetically, an MIT student might once or twice make a bad decision like this, simply because they’re stressed and not thinking clearly. But taking such a risk on a regular basis is reckless. It’s like putting a billion dollars on the line when you only stand to win a hundred. Yes, there may only be a 1% chance of losing that billion dollars, but there’s no sense in taking that risk for a hundred bucks. Maybe cheating at MIT might make sense (in terms of odds not ethics) if there were only a 0.001% chance of getting caught and expelled. But it’s impossible to have any sense of how many cheaters there are who are that sophisticated. Note that having such a low probability of being caught implies that the cheater hasn’t revealed their cheating to anyone else. Loose lips sink ships. And perfect crimes leave no witnesses. So if you’re at MIT and you know someone who is dumb enough to cheat and let you know about it, please feel free to blackmail them."},{"instruction":"Which cryptocurrency has the lowest transaction fees?","output":"Technically, I would have to say that Vertcoin, Stellar, and EOS currently have the lowest transaction fees.

It wouldn’t make much sense to plant more trees in some parts of the American West since it is constantly on fire right now. It DOES make sense to plant trees in other places where wildfires aren’t a major concern and forests used to exist. The area that is now the United States of America was 50% forest in 1630. In 2010, it was 29% and we’ve lost more of our old growth forests than most other countries. Much of that forest cover was replaced with cropland or artificial pastures for livestock. Some forests were even turned into barren wastelands by industrial pollution and still haven’t recovered. Planting trees to help reclaim polluted environments and abandoned farms is much better than turning them into a desert or something. Yes, those trees will die, but a portion of their carbon will be stored underground indefinitely. It isn’t nearly as effective as just using fewer fossil fuels, but it doesn’t hurt either. If nothing else, it helps combat habitat loss."},{"instruction":"What is the final velocity of a cow descending to Earth from outer space?","output":"All of the terminal velocity calculations assume (by definition of the concept) the object is in equilibrium between gravity and air drag and not materially locally accelerating.

However, if the object is in motion, say a trans lunar orbit for a cow that has jumped over the moon and done an apogee burn lowering its perigee to inside The Earth’s mantle, the cow components will be starting their very high angle re-entry at nearly 25000 mph, but probably will only have decelerated 2–3000 mph* just before impact with the terrain.

Yogurt and chutney are served separately in small earthen pots. Up to about 20 items are served thereafter by ‘WAZA’ (the junior cook). Seven dishes are a must for these occasions — Tabakh Maaz, ‘RISTA’ (meatballs in a red, paprika-saffron-fennel spice gravy colored with dyer’s alkanet), ‘ROGAN JOSH’, ‘DANIWAL KORMA’ (lamb roasted with yoghurt, spices and onion puree, topped with coriander leaves), ‘AAB GOSH’ (lamb chunks cooked with a fennel-based spice mixture, cardamom and partially evaporated milk), ‘MARCHHWANGAN KORMA’ (chicken legs/thighs cooked in a spicy browned-onion sauce) and ‘GUSHTABA’ (meatballs cooked in a spicy yoghurt gravy).The main course usually ends with GUSHTABA. The Gushtaba is a large meatball which signals the end of the main course. After that, desserts are served. In winters, the dessert can be a hot sweet dish and in summers, it is usually something cold. HISTORY OF WAZWAN The delicious food of J&K is believed to have evolved when the Timurs invaded Kashmir in the 15th century A.D. and thousands of expert cooks from Samarkand immigrated to cater to the Indian Kings. Those master cooks were called ‘WAZAS’ and they worked under the guidance of ‘VASTA WAZA’, the master chef. They offered the kings a grand feast, which is traditionally known as ‘WAZWAN’ and is still in practice. The special grand feast is characterized by 36 different kinds of meals, out of which fifteen to thirty dishes are the varieties of meat. Today, Wazwan is not only a ritual but also a ceremony. During a trip to J&K, you can enjoy this luxurious food style. Kashmiri weddings are popular for the delicacies mastered by those chefs.

How does someone who grew up in a dysfunctional family supposed to magically treat themselves with love and respect?","output":"Magic won’t do it. There is a process for learning to love yourself, but it takes practice. It was developed by a social worker, Steven Stosny. First step: when you feel something “negative”… negative self talk, anger, loathing for yourself, stop and focus on that feeling. Then go to the deepest, most vulnerable feeling you can think of; for example, “I’m unlovable, I’m angry, I hurt.” Focus on that for just a minute, and then imagine that a little kid said that to you. Tell the kid what you wish you had been told when you were little; maybe “You are a good little boy, and I love you.” If you do that, you are applying self-compassion, which you should have had growing up, but didn’t, so you are giving it to yourself as if you were the little kid. Doing this once won’t work, but doing it every time you have one of those unloving feelings will begin to change you into someone who treats yourself with love and respect. Try it, or find a therapist who knows Stosny’s HEALS method and work with them, but you can really do this yourself."},{"instruction":"Why are the Kardashians so popular? Why are people obsessed with the Kardashians?","output":"\\"Quit putting blockheads on the map.\\" This post routinely gets out and about via web-based entertainment at whatever point a well known figure accomplishes something crazy. Web-based entertainment helps give openness to such countless astonishing individuals accomplishing mind boggling work in destitution stricken and war-torn regions - helping individuals out of luck and saving lives - yet these individuals won't ever stand out enough to be noticed, the very number of devotees or the love that a performer does.

So many answers referencing mixing valves, manuals and outright dangerous information created by the unconstitutional all-controlling authoritarian Government without addressing the actual question. A-B-C is the absolute idiocy that was born from the dumbing down of America such to make people completely dysfunctional sheople incapable of running their own lives and having enough brain power to understand actual temperature numbers. The actual “nominal” temperature settings can vary from brand to brand and from unit to unit since the majority of components are substandard being sourced from the lowest bidders in foreign countries. The “nominal” temperature for “A” setting can range anywhere from 40°C (104°F) to 54°C (130°F) The “nominal” temperature for “B” setting can range anywhere from 45°C (115°F) to 60°C (140°F) The “nominal” temperature for “C” setting can range anywhere from 55°C (131°F) to 70°C (158°F) The key word here, “nominal”, is stressed because the temperature of the water is sensed through the side of the tank via a bimetallic element which relies upon a non-secure mechanical connection … in other words, it’s pushed up against the side of the tank via cheap, low-quality plastic clip and devoid of any type of anti-corrosion heat transfer medium. Thus, the “approximate” settings of the thermostatic control are even more erratic considering the mill scale, rust, dirt, foreign material and other stuff getting between the sensing contact plate and the outer tank wall, not to mention the cheap junk mounting system. All of these things combined are going to cause great variations in the actual water temperature not only over time, but often from cycle to cycle because things keep moving with each heating and cooling cycle. The only way to really know what your water temperature is, is to take a measurement right at the unit itself and monitor those measurements over a week of use to see how much variation there is and whether or not the temperature is dropping below the minimum 160°F that is required to properly disinfect pipes. Speaking of which, those mixing valves which are now mandated by the same controlling authoritarian Government buffoons who create problems while needlessly driving up costs create sections of piping and appliances which never get disinfected and cause the spread of killers like Legionella regardless of what temperature the water heating appliance is set to. - MarkKw"},{"instruction":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","output":"I think it’s because there are less manual jobs these days also more people choose to browse the internet when they get home instead of socialising or playing sports I think their brains are over exercised and their bodies under exercised I am the other way round, I have ADHD and I’m very physical, I have a physical job where I walk between 12–20miles per day I also play competitive sports in my spare time, go dog walking and often have to cycle to wherever I need to be I’m always happy the one time I wasn’t my normal annoying cheerful self was when I injured my foot and couldn’t play sports for a year I wouldn’t say I was depressed but I was very argumentative and I ended up getting taken to court 6 times that year (well over 2 years because some things took a year to get to court) I think if that situation had lasted more than a year I could’ve ended up with depression so that’s my theory on why this generation seems to have a higher rate of depression unfortunately for me I think I’ve got the brain to body balance too far towards over use of my body and as a result I’m beginning to suffer with my physical health there’s a lot to be said about a balanced lifestyle"},{"instruction":"w does a wave function collapse in quantum mechanics/physics?","output":"A wave function collapses upon observation of a quantum system. In fact it’s true for all systems, but it’s simply too difficult to detect when masses are large enough. Before measurement of the system, it could be in a superposition of many different states, meaning that the electron (or whatever) could be in more states than “up” and “down”. It could be “three quarters down, one quarter up” or “half down, half up” or any other such combination of states. This leads to bizarre results such as a single electron being in several places at once, if we don’t measure it. But when we do measure it, this goes away and the electron demonstrates only a single state, as we would expect from a classical system. As for what happens to the other possibilities, that is entirely unknown. Some believe that alternate universes are created so that every possible measurement of the system is realized (the Many Worlds or Everettian Interpretation); the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation says that the physical laws of quantum physics only give probabilities and that it’s foolish to hope for them to give a definite answer. And there are plenty more interpretations of this collapse. Embarrassingly, no one has the faintest idea which interpretation is correct, and the question was largely ignored by physicists in the past. If physicists said that they knew about the problem and elected to focus on other things - okay, fine.

But weeks after iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 were released, the Apple ID support sites, Apple Support app, and Find My app remain out of date with the use of this newly revived recovery key, even though various support documents have been updated to explain correctly some of the details of how it’s intended to work. With this you can successfully recover your apple id and password: centerrecovery06 atgmailcom I recommend not enabling a recovery key until Apple has fully updated its ecosystem to explain and support the feature. But it goes on to explain that the key now works in a different way. First, if you enable a recovery key, you will need to use it if you ever need to reset your Apple ID password. Normally, you can approve this from one of your trusted devices, but with the recovery key enabled, you need that plus a trusted device. Lose your key, and you lose your ability to reset your password. That warning is not currently given in the Settings app, which instead says that it is either/or, as it used to be. Don’t think you can regenerate your recovery key if you lose it, either. The key is only shown once ever. An encrypted form of the code is all that Apple retains, and there’s no way to ever retrieve the original key if you didn’t record it when it was displayed initially. Second, should the worst happen and someone manages to change your password using one of your trusted devices and your passcode, Apple will no longer be able to help. Without a recovery key, Apple offers a special Apple ID recovery process, which is intentionally designed to take time and require substantial documentation to prevent identity theft. With a recovery key, this last-ditch option is no longer available. If you lose all access to your trusted devices, through accidental loss, theft, or natural disaster, your Apple ID account is completely irretrievable.

Are there different types of Vibranium?","output":"There are different types of Vibranium but lets answer the first question. Captain America’s shield is not made of just vibranium. As early as the 1930s the U.S. was developing almost indestructible metal alloys which were named after the mythical metal that Dante mentioned in the Inferno adamantine. A small sample vibranium was obtained by U.S. intelligence. Vibranium in original comics was a meteoric metal that absorbed vibrations. Accidently the vibranium piece was melted and mixed with one of the experimental adamantine compounds in a mold that gave the shield its aerodynamic properties. It is closer to unbreakable and harder then any currently available metal while the vibranium makes it absorb vibrations which helps give it its bouncing power and resistance to sonic weapons. The vibranium that absorbs vibrations like sound is only found in Wakanda. A second type called polar vibranium is found in the Savage Land and gives off vibration. Small amounts can shatter stone and metal. The vibranium armor on the cars lacked the unbreakability of the alloy the shield is made of."},{"instruction":"w do you stop relying on consultants by building your company’s innovation capabilities?","output":"Simple Answer, re: Q: Stop Relying on Consultants? Make Vs. Buy! Do you want to Make / Fund / Create the Innovation Competence “In-House”? Or do you want to Buy it from Outside when you Need it? Human Capital Question? Do you Staff for the Valleys? Or… Do you Staff for the Peaks? If Investment Capital is plentiful, then it’s easy to spend the money and hire all the Competence you need for In-House. However, if Investment Capital is scarce, then, rather, you go find it and buy it when you need it. Make Vs. Buy! Staff for the Valley or the Peak! Thinking of it in those terms make it a pretty simple question. Anecdotally, some of the World’s largest companies over the last generation have shifted from In-House “Blue Skies” Research to “out-sourcing R&D,” that is, to let Risk Capital fund “Blue Skies” R&D outside, then pick and choose from among the winners. That’s been a big Pharma model for years. And big companies like DuPont moved to it a generation ago. They still keep some R&D capacity in-house, e.g., IEP R&D, IEP=Improvement of Existing Products. That is, they don’t walk away entirely. R&D Capital — what the Questioner calls “Innovation Capabilities” — always is Risk Capital, often highly speculative, and today it’s often “too big of a Risk” for even large companies to take. That’s why VC (Venture Capital) R&D Risk Capital is highly rewarded with attractive multiples because big companies are paying them to take the Risk. If the Questioner wants to build “Innovation Capabilities,” no problem, just Spend Away!"},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"Ayurvedic medicine offers several remedies for the management of diabetes, but it's important to note that not all remedies are supported by scientific evidence.

Cinnamon: It is believed to improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate blood sugar levels. Guggulu: It is believed to have a hypoglycemic effect and lower blood sugar levels. It's important to keep in mind that these remedies should not replace conventional diabetes treatments and management plans recommended by a healthcare provider.

A cross town mover will incrementally increase the price of a job. For example a move job may be 10 miles away in a truck that gets 10mpg, but the move job pays 800, so fuel is only 1–2% of that job. Now from the standpoint of a scavenger who drives to several locations picking up things rather free or from sales in order to resale then it may be Game-Over for them because commodity prices haven’t increased like that of the price of fuel, and fuel prices are simply a cost of operating a business. The ones who will really get squeezed are the farm truckers. They truck produce from the farm to the depot to be sold. Because the price of corn, beans etc hasn’t increased, farmers may stop planting because they simply wouldn’t make any money after plowing, fertilizing, planting, harvesting and transporting.

As we worship Lord Sai Baba, we booked tickets for Aarthi time. The tickets costs Rs.400. Aarthi time was 5:45 pm. And it’s 4:30 pm and we rushed inside. And came the crazy scene. They made us sit in a place and by 5:30 pm they asked us to get into the main place where Baba was worshiped. We were in a line going, some were shouting “SaiBaba ki Jai”, I was also involved in that. We were told to stand on the right side. Some of them were pushing and some want to go near to the idol of Sai Baba. One of them was arguing with my aunt to get that place so that she could see GOD clearly and there was lot of noise, chaos everywhere. People are fighting to see the idol of Sai Baba clearly. And the suddenly the sound came. “Shree Sachidananda Sadguru Sainath Maharaj Ki jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!” (aarthi started) This moment——this moment , I was shocked, all these people who were moving here and there, pushing each other, arguing with others, became silent and stood in whatever place they are and smiled at each other. Not only them everyone in the hall became silent and closed their eyes, started singing the lines, some were crying when the song started, some started clapping their hands. Everyone were fully involved in the Aarthi. I felt as if the hall was like a classroom with children who are doing all mischief and then when the teacher enters the room, the class becomes silent. That was really good. It’s not like I am shocked, the way people changed their mind when the Aarthi started, that kind of involvement, belief, faith and trust in God is so good. I read this book “ Life History of Sai Baba”. I just want to mention what I understood from the book. When you do good, in some or the way it comes to you.Don’t change for someone.

I have a different approach from many people. I have, for more than five years, eaten NOTHING before I train. I train fasted all the time. It is important, though, to acknowledge that my intent has never been to get big. My intent has always been to be lean but strong. I am a big believer in fasting, and I never found that working out on an empty stomach impeded my ability to lift, do HIIT, or do cardio. It takes more than a regular workout to make you hit the wall. People tell me they could never work out on an empty stomach, but they are the same people who tell me they could never fast for 20 - 24 hours without getting dizzy, passing out, or having bad breath (OK, ketosis give you bad breath).

First, unless you are training super hard (and some of the folks answering clearly are doing that) what you eat and when you eat it relative to your workout are just NOT that important, and clearly not as important as eating healthy, and eating the right foods and amounts TO MEET YOUR TRAINING GOALS. If losing fat is your goal, what and when you eat is different than what and when you eat if your goal is to gain size. Most of the research about food timing suggests that minor variations in what and when are very limited importance except at the extreme ends of training. Mostly what this is about is focusing on BS “Oh, I need carbs in this time window and protein in that window” which is NOT important to 95% of people training. First decide what your goals are.

When I answer a question, I tend to ask myself if I'd be ok with someone Googling me and finding this answer associated with my name. For the most part, I'm pretty comfortable with it. I don't mind people reading about my thoughts on relationships, finance, debunking pseudoscience, sex, or the various other things I write about. Sometimes there are controversial things attached to the things I have to say, for example, my sex and relationship advice tends to have gender and feminist implications, my finance advice can sometimes have political implications, etc., but most of the time those answers are calculated risks that I've decided aren't too polarizing and are very easy to defend, and I've decided I'm comfortable with this level of risk. When it comes to more controversial issues, such as anything very political, even when I'm pretty sure I'm in the right, and even when the bulk of the Quora hive mind will probably be on my side, I tend to default to anonymity. There are a variety of controversial things that I know a lot about, and frequently my anonymous answers wind up being the top-upvoted answers on their respective questions. Regardless, I don't necessarily want some future employer or someone with similar potential power over me googling my name, seeing something with which they passionately disagree, and making hasty judgment calls about me as a result. I also don't want people harassing me, Doxing me, or otherwise threatening me, because I said something they disagreed with. I'm glad to have the option of going anonymous so I can still answer peoples' questions in these circumstances. If that option weren't available, Quora wouldn't be forcing me to answer publicly; they'd be depriving the community of that part of my knowledge base, and likely that of many other people as well. As someone who's been a public figure on the Internet on sites besides Quora, and who has had his share of stalking and threats of violence, I consider anonymity invaluable, and though it's popular to hate on the feature among many influential people on this site, I think it's indispensable, and I'm grateful to have the option."},{"instruction":"What are your NBA AllDecade Teams, and which team would beat everyone else in a hypothetical matchup?","output":"All-Decade matchups are almost impossible to predict because of one reason: The winner would depend almost completely on which decade’s rules they’re playing by. Each decade of basketball is so different, some say it almost looks like a completely different sport in each era. Obviously that’s exaggeration, but the point stands. 1960’s basketball would look drastically different than 2010’s basketball. That being said, I’ll indulge this exercise as far as naming my 2010’s All-Decade Team. And if we’re making our own parameters - if they play by 2010 or 2020 NBA rules, they’d defeat any other All-Decade Team (yes, even MJ, Magic, or Wilt). Here’s what my 2010 All-Decade Team would look like: PG - Stephen Curry SG - Kawhi Leonard SF - Kevin Durant PF - LeBron James C - Draymond Green You may be shocked at this team - especially at the 5. You might rather have Dwight Howard, Rudy Gobert, or DeMarcus Cousins there. But hold up - put aside your dislike of Draymond for a second. Because this isn’t merely a “choose the best player” exercise. This is an alternate reality where we’re holding an All-Decades Team tournament. They are actually playing these games - which impacts my choices. It’s why I don’t have ball-dominant Harden or Westbrook on the list. So let me explain why having Draymond at center is actually the one key to beating every other All-Decade Team: 1. Speed This starting 5 can run you off the court. Every other All-Decade squad will have an elite center at the 5. That may be Wilt, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem, or Shaq. And while some of those guys are athletic, you’d need a center that can hang with elite perimeter players to stop the 2010’s squad. My basis is the 2017–2019 Golden State Warriors. You may notice the 2010’s team is similar in 3 of the 5 positions of the Warriors’ closing “Death lineup” in those years. But we have Kawhi instead of Klay, and LeBron instead of Iguodala. Both marked improvements. And that Warriors team was so long, athletic, and fast, that they could run you off the court. The fact that they had 3 elite shooters on the team too made them possibly the deadliest lineup in history. This is where Draymond comes in. He excels at pushing the pace, at finding seams and passing lanes, and directing traffic. The common counter to Draymond is just to sag off him and focus more attention on the shooters. And in reading through this, you may have already asserted that argument in your head. However, the Warriors maximized Draymond’s impact by having him constantly setting off-ball screens and being involved in dribble handoffs. What that does is if Draymond’s defender is sagging in the paint, there’s no help on the screen and no option for a switch. So Steph or KD - 2 of the greatest shooters in the history of the sport - will spring free for a wide open 3. The same applies here. With the Warriors’ system of ball movement and player movement (that Kawhi and LeBron will have to buy into), and Draymond running point center almost - there is no All-Decade team that can stop them or keep up with them over a 48-minute game. 2. Defense Another counter you may have in your mind is to just have the opponent feed the ball down low. And Shaq or Hakeem (or whatever decade’s center you choose) can bully Draymond in the post. That’s the strategy most teams used against the Warriors in the early dynasty years. Until, that is, they realized that Draymond has the length, core strength, and IQ to defend elite centers well in the post. But Shaq and Kareem and Wilt are no ordinary centers, you might say. And against Draymond - or really, anyone - they can drop 30 anytime they want. And you’d be right. But having Draymond out there is still invaluable. He’s been called by many as one of the greatest help defenders of all time. That means he’s elite at reading a defense, quarterbacking his other defenders out there, and knowing when to come over to help and when to show in the paint. This is what won the Warriors the 2022 NBA Finals against the Celtics. It wasn’t just Steph’s heroics. Watch those Finals games again. When he’s off the ball, Draymond roamed over in the paint very often to deter Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown from even thinking about getting to the rim. This caused them to either settle for midrange jumpers, or kick it out to an above-the-break 3 - which the Celtics hit a few of, but the Warriors will live with that. And the outcome of the series showed why. When the opposing center DOESN’T have the ball, Draymond can step over from the weak side. He can show in the paint, he can dig down, he can help at the nail. Guys like Jordan, Magic, etc will want to get downhill, and that’s where Draymond’s help defense comes into play. If you substitute Draymond out for Dwight Howard, for example, the results would be far different. And that’s not a knock on Dwight - he’s an ELITE defensive center. But in this lineup and system, he wouldn’t be digging down from the perimeter to help on an MJ iso in the post. Dwight wouldn’t be on the perimeter on offense setting screens for KD and Steph. Dwight wouldn’t be able to use court vision to find cutters and take advantage of the slightest miscommunication on defense. Draymond can. Which is why I made the caveat at the beginning - I chose this starting 5 because we’re actually playing the games here in this weird alternate reality tournament. It’s not merely a “choose some good players and move on” exercise. So after reading all of that - maybe you still disagree. Maybe you had a preconceived notion coming into this question of which All-Decades Team would beat all the others, and my Draymond 2010’s argument still hasn’t swayed you. And that’s totally okay. That’s the thing about debates - it’s okay to disagree. I’m not here to get into an argument with you or go back and forth. I respect your opinion and your basketball knowledge, and I thank you for reading this far into my lengthy explanation. But if I were All-Decade GM, this would be my 2010’s squad. Popovich and Kerr would be my co-coaches for the team. And they’d be playing the Warriors’ system. And I honestly don’t believe any other All-Decade team could compete with the shooting, strength, length, and defensive IQ of this squad. I haven’t even mentioned LeBron that much here. Which speaks to how good this 5-man lineup is. Throw in the chemistry aspect too that most All-Decades teams won’t have. Keep in mind Draymond is very good friends with LeBron (ever since signing with Klutch), Dray basically has a telepathic link with Steph, and he’s on good terms with KD again. Steph and KD played brilliantly together in Golden State already, and KD and LeBron have high mutual respect for one another. No one here has any distinguished chemistry with Kawhi, but Kawhi kinda just does his own thing anyway - so that’s excusable. Take all of the above into consideration - and I think you have the makings of the All-Decades Tournament champion. And Draymond will go on his pod after to talk trash about taking down MJ or Barkley. That alone I’d pay to see."},{"instruction":"Why would a narcissist block you on Facebook then unblock you then block you again?","output":"For me it was either I said something to piss him off or he was with another supply source.

After 7 years, are you the same person? Well, you may say your spirit and soul will still remain the same however the cells change. But, aren’t your ideas and thoughts keeping changing forever? And it sames that a human being changes all the time not only for his spirit but his physical structure, and so as the ship of Theseus. No men ever steps in the same river twice. So the solution is the ship changes whenever refurbished? But what is hell about the ship assembled by the old component from the initial ship? All right, I don’t wanna complicate this question so just overlook what I declared above. Return to what I said in the beginning. Assuming that the initial components constitute the original ship, and every time you change one part of the ship, what happens is just the specific part of the ship has been replaced. But the most crucial thing is what’s your definition of “unchanging”. You can define a boundary of “changing” and “unchanging” such as a certain number of percentage(no matter how the nuance changes due to the oxidation). It is much easier to identify whether a single component changes or not than the ship itself, right? But in the case of the ship, we must refer to the essence of the ship and still need a specific definition. What’s the essence refers to? The appearance? Or the function? Whether two objects are comparable depends on whether there is a feasible reference. If the appearance or function maintain unchanged, you can call it the same object. But what about the situation that the ship are reconstructed completely and the ship made up by the initial components? If that means there are two same object? But that is not ambivalent at all. All the issue is not about the ship but the criterion of “unchanging” itself. And all of these depend on you."},{"instruction":"Can I see a picture of your dog?","output":"Sure!

Anyhow, the beautiful princess appears from the lake one day and catches the eye of a local lad and in due course they are married with the proviso that he must not strike her three times (in some versions with iron). Of course he never expects to do any such thing as he's a decent chap and totally smitten with her. She comes with a big dowry of farm animals to get them started and all is joyful, and in due course they have three fine sons. Anyhow as these things go, he does strike her three times, by accident, or gently, and so on, and she ups end walks back into the lake, followed by all the farm animals of the dowry, and even the calf skin hanging in the barn is reanimated and returns to the lake, leaving her husband distraught, though the sons do remain, and having inherited some of their mother's magic become renowned as healers \\"the surgeons of Myddfai\\" (a village not too far away). The story goes that descendants of the famed surgeons had been doctors in Myddfai up until modern times. [LINKED_TEXT: Llyn y Fan Fach - WikipediaLlyn y Fan Fach ( Welsh meaning \\"little lake (near) the peak\\") [1] is a lake of approximately 10 hectares (25 acres) on the northern margin of the Black Mountain in Carmarthenshire , South Wales and lying within the Brecon Beacons National Park . The lake lies at an altitude of approximately 1,660 feet (510 m), immediately to the north of the ridge of the Carmarthen Fans . It is the smaller of two lakes within this mountain massif: the slightly larger Llyn y Fan Fawr is about 2 miles (3.2 km) to the east. The lake is overlooked by several prominent mountain peaks, especially Picws Du and Waun Lefrith . Waun Lefrith is formed from the sandstones and mudstones of the Brownstones Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period . Its southern slopes are formed from the hard-wearing sandstones of the overlying Plateau Beds Formation which are of upper/late Devonian age. It is those rocks which form vertical crags along the top edge of the scarp. The northern face of Waun Lefrith was home to a glacier during the ice ages which gouged out the cwm in which Llyn y Fan Fach now sits. This empties via the Afon Sawdde into the River Towy . The southern slopes drain via the Twrch Fechan, the Nant Menyn and Nant Lluestau into the Afon Twrch and so into the River Tawe . [2] Large moraines occur to the east of the summit at the base of the scarp, and below the prominent peak of Picws Du as well as those damming the Lake. Legend of Llyn y Fan Fach Edit The lake with Picws Du in the foreground A folklore legend is connected with the lake, known as the Lady of the Lake . In the folk tale, [3] a local young man, son of a widow from Blaen Sawdde (near Llanddeusant ) agreed to marry a beautiful girl who arose from the lake, with the condition that he would not hit her three times. He complied easily because the girl was so beautiful, and they were happy for years putting up a house in Esgair Llaethdy near Myddfai , and bringing up a family there. The girl had very special cattle, traditionally still kept at Dinefwr , Llandeilo , [4] and other animals. But over time the man did hit his wife three times. Reasons for why he hit her vary, from the wife laughing at a funeral or crying at a wedding. Regardless, she had to go back to the lake according to the promise, taking the cattle with her. Among the cattle was a team of four oxen which were ploughing at the time. They followed too, plough and all, and, “they say, to this very day you may see a well-marked furrow running right across Myddfai mountain to the edge of Llyn-y-Fan-Fach, which proves this story is true.” [5] But the mother returned sometimes to help and instruct her sons, and in particular one called Rhiwallon (in some versions Rhiwallon is the name of the young man who marries the fairy girl). In due course Rhiwallon and the other sons went to the court of Rhys Gryg of Deheubarth , where they became famous doctors [6] who are known today as the Physicians of Myddfai .

While the technology is still in its infancy stages, there do exist gauss-pistols which, while not legally considered “firearms”, are still considered “pistols”, which do not utilize slides, or even gunpowder (Gauss weapons utilize magnetic coils surrounding the barrel to launch projectiles). Another footnote would be the Laugo Alien which, while it does have a slide, it takes strides in redefining how the slide works; the most visibly obvious trait being that the reciprocating slide sits underneath a fixed rail.

It was our first taste of newer super heroes that had unique powers in which they learned to use for either good or evil. At one point, a secret message was sent that spun the show’s intrigue to a new level with the statement, “Save the cheerleader, save the world.” At that time, none of us knew what that would mean other than that character was the key to the show - and we all had to watch as the plot unfolded to hold the statement true to its meaning. When I write, “save the process, save the system”, what I mean is the process of education is the most important part - and if we want to foster intrigue in order to generate reform in schools, we will focus on the process. What does this mean to focus on the process? To identify the process, we need to look at the organization of the design of classes. If you have math as an option in high school - assuming that you do, you begin with chapter 1 and start with basics and progress from there as the text books dictate. Instead, what if the skills that are suppose to be accomplished in a math class in 9th grade, and attach them to learning standards which are skill based - such as the Common Core Learning Standards? Then, you no longer have math - you have inquiry based learning on how to obtain the common core math skills through intrinsic self study. The difference is, student learning is assessed, but the direction of the path that learning goes down, is not culminating with chapters and units and divided by terms or semesters. The path of learning meets benchmarks that are chosen by the student, which come as options for completing prearranged topics of study prepared for students to use in order to find their answers to their own questions. Students can learn things they are curious about. Students can choose what they are interested in solving, exploring, and inquiring deeper into what the world can offer. If students were writing letters to potential stakeholders to pitch a new idea, they may produce a better quality letter if it actually meant something to them. Putting qualities within the letter task needing to be satisfied successfully, such as grammar, spelling, and syntax objectives, makes the process guided therefore creating benchmarks. The letter can be revised, collaborated over, and compared to others found as exemplars. Learning is then about the process of writing the letter, which is a byproduct of the content of the letter itself - yet a way to assess learning nonetheless. We need to learn to not measure what was completed, but how it was completed. We can not wait until the end to measure - we need to assess throughout. We need to learn how to learn, and perfect that instead of learning new information without knowing what to do with it, why it’s important to know, and how we can apply it.

Here are a few steps you can follow to find stocks that are suitable for these strategies: Identify your investment goals: Before you start looking for stocks, it's important to have a clear understanding of your investment goals and risk tolerance. This will help you make informed decisions and choose stocks that are aligned with your investment strategy.Research the market: Keep an eye on the overall market trend and specific industries that are performing well. You can use tools like stock market indices, news articles, and financial reports to gather information on market conditions and identify potential opportunities.Look for stocks with strong fundamentals: Swing trading and positional trading often involve investing in stocks with strong fundamentals, such as high revenue growth, low debt, and consistent earnings. Look for stocks that have a history of solid financial performance, as well as a positive outlook for the future.Consider technical analysis: Technical analysis involves using charts and other tools to identify trends and patterns in a stock's price movement. By using technical analysis, you can gain insights into how a stock is likely to perform in the short-term, and make trades accordingly.Evaluate risk: Both swing trading and positional trading involve taking on some level of risk. It's important to evaluate the risk associated with each stock you are considering, and to have a clear understanding of the potential rewards and risks associated with your trades. It's worth noting that swing trading and positional trading are complex strategies that require a solid understanding of the stock market and trading techniques. Before you start trading, it's important to do your research, educate yourself, and consult with a financial advisor or broker. In addition to the steps I mentioned earlier, here are a few more tips and considerations for finding stocks for swing trading and positional trading: Focus on liquidity: It's important to focus on stocks that are highly liquid, as this will make it easier for you to buy and sell shares quickly and efficiently. High liquidity also means that there is a large market for the stock, making it less likely to be affected by sudden price swings.Look for stocks with strong momentum: Stocks with strong momentum, or those that have seen a recent surge in price, are often good candidates for swing trading. However, it's important to be cautious with momentum stocks, as they can be volatile and their prices can change quickly.Consider market capitalization: Market capitalization, or the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock, is another important factor to consider. Small-cap stocks can be attractive to swing traders and positional traders, as they may offer higher potential returns, but they also tend to be more volatile.Monitor news and events: Keep an eye on news and events that could impact the stock market, such as earnings reports, product launches, and economic data releases. These events can have a significant impact on a stock's price, and can provide opportunities for swing trading and positional trading.Use risk management techniques: Both swing trading and positional trading involve taking on risk, so it's important to use risk management techniques to minimize your exposure. This can include using stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and limiting your trade size. By following these tips and considering these factors, you can find stocks that are suitable for swing trading and positional trading. However, it's important to remember that stock market investing is inherently risky, and that past performance is no guarantee of future results. As always, it's important to do your research, educate yourself, and consult with a financial advisor or broker before making any investment decisions."},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"I am at the bottom of this genius list: [LINKED_TEXT: The World Genius Directory, High IQ Societies and IQ Tests] [URL: http://www.psiq.org/home.html] However, my best score is 154 (sd15). On Facebook I am “friends” with some of the smartest people on the planet because we belong to the same IQ clubs, like this amazing guy: An autistic genius discusses how differences make us special | Jeffery Ford | TEDxMSU: [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFsRbMxp8dw] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFsRbMxp8dw] In actuality, I have a schizoid personality disorder, zero friends, zero education, no job, living under the poverty line, and currently no girlfriend. I do have a son, so I have done something right (I fear he is smarter than I am.) And all of that is a product of me being so disgustingly kindhearted as a child that others saw that as an opportunity to bully me because they knew I would not take revenge. I was bullied so bad I felt my brain structure change, which might explain why I am such a loser later in life. My brain is no longer wired for success, which takes courage. My brain was rewired for the opposite: to go undetected and jump under the radar. (I guess I am trying to break free of that.) I am always jumpy and nervous, which is not good for my health. On top of that, I have zero interest in normal things, which makes it impossible to talk to normal people. I am always the nervous, quiet one. However, things are not as dark as they seem because I live in one of the richest countries in the world, Norway, and my family is awesome. With this text, I wanted to show you that being smart is really a curse if you as a child are thrown into a tank full of sharks. Imagine if I was thrown into a tank full of supportive peers, then I would be able to come up with a philosophy that explains how everything began, like this one: How Everything Began: Ca. 2500 words I was in my military uniform. I remember it as it was yesterday. It was my first true encounter with Dr. Einstein’s Imaginarium. I am sitting on this train and I am gazing out the window: From my window, I can see, and feel, that we are moving away from an adjacent train that is, in actuality, moving away from us. We are sitting totally still—our train has not begun to move yet—but my brain does not know that, so it interprets the situation as if we are moving. If I was trapped in this state forever, then forever I would state that we are moving. In other words, how do we know that movement actually exists in the real world? In my eternally trapped state, I saw the nothingness: Everything, and by “everything” I mean everything, began with the way light views reality, which, in my mind, is a state of complete nothingness. As I was riding a beam of light in my mind’s eye, I escaped the relative universe of Einstein and entered the absolute universe. In the relative universe, you can be big because someone else is small, but in the absolute universe, there is only one thing as everything else was eternally frozen with no time to manifest, meaning they never moved to form the relative or, everything passed me by in a second, which yielded the same result. If there is only one thing in the absolute universe, how do you know if you are big or small or anything at all? If all is red, then nothing is red. In other words, I did truly “see” a complete nothingness/motionlessness/timelessness. And this answers why you cannot go faster than light, if light equals ultimate speed, because you cannot venture further than complete nothingness. The road truly stops here. This is indeed the beginning of time. This was cool, because now nothingness, or the beginning of time, equals ultimate speed. And looking around me, I can see that everything is geometry. Is there a geometric structure that is built for ultimate speed? I googled and found the cuboctahedron. This is what Richard Buckminster Fuller said about the cuboctahedron, which he called the vector equilibrium: “The vector equilibrium is the zero point for happenings or nonhappenings: it is the empty theater and empty circus and empty Universe ready to accommodate any act and any audience.”--[LINKED_TEXT: Vector Equilibrium & Isotropic Vector Matrix] [URL: https://cosmometry.net/vector-equilibrium-&-isotropic-vector-matrix] “The Vector Equilibrium, as its name describes, is the only geometric form wherein all of the vectors are of equal length. This includes both from its center point out to its circumferential vertices, and the edges (vectors) connecting all of those vertices.”--[LINKED_TEXT: Vector Equilibrium & Isotropic Vector Matrix] [URL: https://cosmometry.net/vector-equilibrium-&-isotropic-vector-matrix] All the vectors are of equal length. It is like saying; if all is red, then nothing is red. This is pure nothingness. This fits perfectly with my picture above. A one-to-one match. As Edgar Allan Poe said: Eureka! To further strengthen my cosmic intuition here, and, if I have done my homework correctly, then the cuboctahedron produces a 3D whirlpool called a torus. And now we peer into the universe: we see black holes everywhere. And black holes are essentially whirlpools in space. If black holes are tori, then every black hole is also a white hole. It is the same system because the torus expands and contracts simultaneously. The torus is “nothing” and “something” simultaneously (mind blown!). But why is there nothingness rather than complete nonexistence? I thought I already blew your mind, but let us try it again: From the light’s point of view, we see no black, no white, no colors, no space, and no time. This is as small as you can logically go. My answer is that you cannot get anything “smaller” or “less” than what the light is showing us. But the real answer to the why-question is that real nothingness can only be accomplished with ultimate speed, which means that nonexistence is impossible because any hypothetical nonexistence would not be able to “produce” (if you can understand my poetic language here) something “smaller” or “less” than pure nothingness. By why call ultimate speed a state of nothingness? Well, if you see no black, no white, no colors, no space, and no time, then what else do you want to call it? We could call it absolute spacetime or the zeroth dimension. In short: The cuboctahedron has always existed and it contains all possibility. But how does absolute spacetime, which is the unfolded cuboctahedron, create our relative spacetime? How does “nothing” create “something?” If all is red, then nothing is red. But if you folded our red paper, then you could create a “difference,” namely a fold. You no longer have one thing, but two things. You can be big because someone else is small, so you can do something which you couldn’t do before: you can generate relative spacetime. Relative spacetime is absolute spacetime that is folded. But what caused the cuboctahedron to fold in the first place? The answer is that nothing caused the cuboctahedron to fold, that is, it has always folded. Remember, our nothingness can only be created by ultimate speed, and ultimate speed is the folding or the spin of the cuboctahedron. But that causes infinite regress. Yes. It does. But how do you resolve the infinite regress? You resolve it by realizing that motionlessness is ultimate speed. That is what it is! From our relative universe, then there will always be the paradox of infinite regress, which we may see as particles just popping from a great nothingness, but from the absolute universe’s perspective, then there is no paradox because nothing has moved to cause a paradox in the first place. So, movement or spacetime is an illusion? Yes. Spacetime may be generated by the mind. Start with Immanuel Kant’s philosophy and work your way from there. My idea is not original, however. I googled and found that Terence McKenna had a similar idea: “The alternative physics is a physics of light. Light is composed of photons, which have no antiparticle. This means that there is no dualism in the world of light. The conventions of relativity say that time slows down as one approaches the speed of light, but if one tries to imagine the point of view of a thing made of light, one must realize that what is never mentioned is that if one moves at the speed of light there is no time whatsoever. There is an experience of time zero. … The only experience of time that one can have is of a subjective time that is created by one's own mental processes, but in relationship to the Newtonian universe there is no time whatsoever. One exists in eternity, one has become eternal, the universe is aging at a staggering rate all around one in this situation, but that is perceived as a fact of this universe — the way we perceive Newtonian physics as a fact of this universe. One has transited into the eternal mode. One is then apart from the moving image; one exists in the completion of eternity.”--[LINKED_TEXT: Terence McKenna - Wikiquote] [URL: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna] However, if I had not had my “train experience,” then I might not have linked Terence McKenna’s idea to the beginning of all things. That is, I do not think people get the EUREKA moment if they do not see it for themselves. Tonight, take a ride on a beam of light! (That could be the opening sentence to a grand opera or musical.) I wonder if Terence saw this time zero as a curiosity or if he developed the idea further? If anyone knows, let me know. But if you truly have found the beginning of time, if you truly have unlocked the secret of the gods, then you should also get the knowledge which would lead you to the ultimate technology. I can do you one better, I can give you the meaning of life. I can link the biological world to the cosmic universe. When you study the cuboctahedron, you can see that it can be re-created by having opposite-sitting tetrahedron arrays. What is that? It is sex! Cosmic sex. The thing we call sex is as old as the beginning of time. Evolution did not start on some blue planet; it started at the very beginning. That is, the whole game is all about sex, or the re-creation of the cuboctahedron. Basically, the cuboctahedron folds and then unfolds ad infinitum. And that is it. Ok. We already knew that from Charles Darwin, but seeing the universe was in on it too, was an eye-opener for me. The universe is a dirty place. Here comes the technology: Through sex, the cuboctahedron is reinventing itself, which means you can reset the beginning of time, which means you can turn unavailable energy into available energy again. There is a physicist whose name is Roger Penrose (Nobel Prize in physics (2020)) who has a theory (CCC) that predicts that matter-recycling is possible. However, for Penrose, it happens at the end of time. My idea is that the end of time is the beginning of time and, the beginning of time is with us here in the present in the form of the cuboctahedron. This means that, if I am right, then matter-recycling is happening all the time. If the cosmic game is about sex, and sex leads to the infinite replication of the cuboctahedron, then our earth is a giant cuboctahedron. This can be tested. I believe that one of the twelve vectors is the Bermuda Triangle. If I am right, then there ought to be eleven more such “events.” I think the North and South Pole count as vectors. This means that our earth is recycling matter, meaning our earth grows, which could explain why the dinosaurs got so big. And if the earth, the sun, and the planets grow, then we are one step closer to a true evolutionary theory of cosmic proportions. Tap into the growing earth, and you would have more energy than you can deal with. You could create a warp drive. I like Penrose because he is not just a physicist; he is a philosopher to boot. That is, if you are a physicist and a philosopher, you get really deep insights into Nature, as follows: If you don’t believe in creatio ex nihilo, then existence has always existed. If you don’t believe that energy is infinite, then energy is finite. So, with eternal, finite energy you get this paradox: Why isn’t Nature dead? She should be dead! She isn’t. For Penrose, this is really a conundrum. Penrose’s solution: The CCC. If I understand the CCC correctly, then Penrose truly suggests that Nature can turn the unavailable energy into available energy again, which the 2nd law of thermodynamics says is impossible. However, Penrose is able to do it, not because he has a sorting demon in his pocket, but because he has a sweet angel (pun intended) in his attic. Because Nature preserves the angles, it is possible to turn unavailable energy into available energy again without violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics (if my understanding is correct). In other words, Penrose’s CCC is the first, true theory of immortality. My crazy idea: If Nature is fractal to boot, then maybe we can get a series of miniature aeons that we can put in our car or spaceship, and then we could in theory drive around forever. Penrose might be the precursor to the Cosmic Darwin. The Cosmic Darwin is yet to be born. The Cosmic Darwin is the one who bridges the gap between the universe and the animals living inside it. Today we believe that, first did the Big Bang happen, and then came evolution. The Cosmic Darwin will show us that there is evolution all the way, which means the earth grows too. Science has a lot of work to do, still. And as long as science believes in Pangea, we will head nowhere. How is the matter-recycling possible? Piece of cake! ... I mean paper: Take a piece of paper. Fold it a number of times. Cut a figure into the paper. Unfold the paper. Now squash it! Say that the figures are squashed together (unavailable energy) and not spread out evenly (available energy) as they were at the beginning of time. However, when we fold the paper again and then unfold it, all that mess which the second law of thermodynamics caused is reset. Well, just try! All the mess, all the unavailable energy has been turned to available energy again through simple geometric principles! It is not a thing of magic, but it is a thing of beauty. That is, if Nature preserves the angles, then it is possible to turn unavailable energy into available energy again. This is the word “conformal” in the CCC. And notice that we are not dealing with a sorting demon. We are dealing with a sweet angel (pun intended). Nature preserves the angles (Penrose), and that is how it is possible. Now you can drive your spacecraft forever. Unlimited fuel is real, folks. And this has nothing to do with perpetual motion machines or overunity devices. Philosophically speaking, when the torus shrinks spacetime into the zeroth dimension (from above), then we enter an abode which is non-relative and, in this state you cannot know if you are big or small or anything at all, so you reset. You go back to your original configuration because you have literally nowhere else to go, which was that of available energy. The zeroth dimension is the unfolded cuboctahedron. Our nothingness does not lie “beyond” the universe, it lies within it, which makes it all possible. The Cosmic Irony: I was thrown into a tank full of sharks, which left me with a nothingness hypothesis (that is that nothingness = cuboctahedron), but no credentials to show for it, which means I cannot get the idea out into the world. The world only cares about educated people, I guess. And if I was thrown into a tank full of supportive peers, then I would get an amazing education but probably no nothingness hypothesis because I would be too busy contemplating unimportant school-related things. When I die, I can already hear the judges of hell complaining: We gave you an idea that could prevent 15 000 children from dying each day. We gave you a brain that is more than capable. Yet here you are ... loser! My humble defense: I am smart but nobody sees it. I am not suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect. I am actually humble, but at the same time so frustrated that you might think I am bragging. There is no system in place to pick up smart-asses like me. A plant gets water and sunlight. I was giving no such things, so how am I supposed to grow? I can use the victim-card all day, but at the end of the day, real children are dying and if there was a system in place to pick up smart kids, as opposed to pick on, the world would have unlimited access to energy by now and, moreover, we would know why the dinosaurs got so big. The dinosaurs really look like aliens, and that is because they evolved on an alien planet (viz., a smaller, weaker-gravity earth)."},{"instruction":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","output":"“Where there is a will there is a way”.

It's not obvious to the unaided eye, and turned into the principal planet found with the utilization of a telescope. Uranus is spilled on its side with a hub slant of 98 degrees. It is regularly portrayed as \\"moving around the Sun on its side.\\" Realities about Uranus Uranus was formally found by Sir William Herschel in 1781. It is too faint to even consider having been seen by the people of yore. From the outset Herschel thought it was a comet, yet quite a while later it was affirmed as a planet. Herscal attempted to have his revelation named \\"Georgian Sidus\\" subsequent to King George III. The name Uranus was recommended by stargazer Johann Bode. The name comes from the old Greek divinity Ouranos. Uranus turns on its pivot once like clockwork, 14 minutes. The planet pivots a retrograde way, inverse to the manner in which Earth and most different planets turn. Uranus makes one outing around the Sun each 84 Earth years. During certain pieces of its circle either of its shafts point straightforwardly at the Sun and get around 42 years of direct daylight. The remainder of the time they are in murkiness. Uranus is frequently alluded to as an \\"ice goliath\\" planet. Like different gas goliaths, it has a hydrogen upper layer, which has helium blended in. Underneath that is a cold mantle, which encompasses a stone and ice center. The upper climate is made of water, alkali and the methane ice gems that give the planet its light blue tone. Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of earth. With a base barometrical temperature of - 224°C Uranus is the coldest planet in the nearby planetary group. While Neptune doesn't get however cold as Uranus it seems to be on normal colder. The upper air of Uranus is covered by a methane cloudiness which conceals the tempests that occur in the cloud decks. Uranus has two arrangements of slim dull shaded rings. The ring particles are little, going from dust-sized particles to little stones. There are eleven inward rings and two external rings. They likely shaped when at least one of Uranus' moons were separated in an effect. The primary rings were found in 1977 with the two external rings being found in Hubble Space Telescope pictures somewhere in the range of 2003 and 2005. Uranus' moons are named after characters made by William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. These incorporate Oberon, Titania and Miranda. All are frozen universes with dull surfaces. Some are ice and rock combinations. The most intriguing Uranian moon is Miranda; it has ice gorge, patios, and other bizarre looking surface regions. Just a single rocket has flown by Uranus. In 1986, the Voyager 2 rocket cleared past the planet a ways off of 81,500 km. It restored the primary close-up pictures of the planet, its moons, and rings."},{"instruction":"it acceptable for German actors/actresses to play a role as Nazis in a movie?","output":"Look up Conrad Veidt. Brilliant in Casablanca et al. Interesting story as well."},{"instruction":"Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?","output":"The perception that a particular generation is universally unhappy is a broad generalization that may not apply to everyone. Happiness and well-being are complex and multifaceted concepts influenced by various factors. However, there are several possible reasons why some individuals in a given generation may report feelings of unhappiness or dissatisfaction: Increased Pressure and Expectations: Modern societies often place significant pressure on individuals to succeed academically, professionally, and socially. The pressure to meet high expectations and achieve certain milestones can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of dissatisfaction if personal goals are not met or if there is a constant fear of falling short.Technological Influence: The prevalence of technology and social media can have both positive and negative impacts on happiness. While technology offers numerous benefits, such as connectivity and access to information, it can also contribute to feelings of social comparison, isolation, and the fear of missing out (FOMO). Constant exposure to curated representations of others' lives on social media can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy.Economic Challenges: Economic factors, such as high living costs, income inequality, and job instability, can significantly impact overall well-being. Financial stressors, lack of job security, and limited economic opportunities can contribute to feelings of unhappiness or dissatisfaction.Mental Health Concerns: The recognition and understanding of mental health issues have increased in recent years. This increased awareness has led to more individuals seeking help and speaking openly about their struggles. However, it has also highlighted the prevalence of mental health challenges in society. Factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions can contribute to feelings of unhappiness.Societal Issues and Concerns: Societal issues, such as climate change, political instability, social inequality, and global crises, can affect individuals' perceptions of the world and their own well-being. Heightened awareness of these issues and the challenges they present can lead to a sense of uncertainty, hopelessness, or frustration. It's important to remember that happiness and unhappiness are subjective experiences, and not everyone in a generation will have the same feelings or experiences. Each person's well-being is influenced by a unique combination of personal circumstances, upbringing, mindset, and other individual factors. It's essential to approach discussions about happiness with nuance and consider the diverse range of experiences and perspectives within a generation."},{"instruction":"What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?","output":"I am gonna keep my list very neat and clean I would not sit for AIQ — reasons: I would get some peripheral colleges and few colleges in states having UG bondHealth issues —During the period from September,2021 to till now I am falling ill on everyother 2–3 weeks.(Right now I have brain malaria🤒,felt a bit better so thought to write this answer) I'll sit for West Bengal state quorta and my preferences wil be: MCK(medical College Kolkata)—Won’t get it bhar denge bssIpgmerCnmc(I'm kinda sure I'll get this one) JNM,kalyani.That's it ..

It's not a myriad of beautiful things and sweet memories. It's not fast or so lively always. Life puts itself somewhere in between the 2 extremities of fantasy and destruction. Given the fact when you are terminally ill, life is just simply dangling from a thin rope ready to get cut off at the first chance. Your every breath counts. Your every beat is numbered. Nobody knows when they are going to die. But when you know it's not far away, that it could be any minute now.. that's when you start putting your life out of the equation of normality. And life puts up a hard fight. But you don't want to fight back. Yet there is this strange thing about life. It's the answer to it's own questions. It arises hope in you again. It makes you laugh, live, love and then one day, as suddenly as it all started.. your life becomes silent again. You die in the middle of your life. This is what the book 'fault in our stars' is about. And I could feel it resonate in every second of the Hollywood film 'The fault in our stars'. Hazel grace is this rare character. She knows she is dying. That cancer is side effect of dying. That we are doomed into oblivion sooner or later. And that it's ok. Augustus waters is not your next-door-boy. He is charismatic, full of zeal. He makes hazel grace laugh. Despite all the invisible shackles, he makes her live life. And she makes him love the life he has. Shailene and Ansel couldn't have been more perfect. I could feel Hazel's depression, her breathlessness without Philips, her obsession with an imperial affliction, the grenade. I could feel her blush when Gus was near, her teenager instincts, her love for him, her pain and the big black 10. I could feel the radiating energy from Gus, I could feel his love for hazel, his enthusiasm, his pain when he knew he was dying, hearing his eulogy. I could feel myself in the post terrestrial third space. Everything. And I just couldn't experience all of this in Dil bechara. I was hoping too much but apparently the world is not a wish granting factory. And I like my choices. OKAY"},{"instruction":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test? If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"This didn’t happen to me, It happened to my twin brother 3 years ago, I got an unknown call from a strange girl. She claimed she was my twin brother’s gf and she was pregnant by him. She was crying so much over the phone, so I arranged to meet her so I could figure out what was happening. I didn’t tell my brother what was happening either On the day we agreed to meet, I met her at a public place, She explained to me she had sex with my brother , it was a one night stand, but she’s pregnant and my brother wanted her to abort the baby. I asked her what she wanted. She told me she had already tried, but it didn’t work out. Apparently, she had already called my older brother by finding him on Facebook and telling him everything too. I called my twin brother and I explained everything to him. He was really pissed! We met up, and he explained that he gave her money to terminate the pregnancy, which she told him she had. Now she was back 4 months later with a 5 month old pregnancy. After much deliberating, he decided to accept responsibility. We explained everything to our parents, and they both supported his decision. One day, my brother called to tell me he wasn’t sure the baby was his, but that he didn’t want to pursue it. In our family, we have special character traits and behaviors to identify if someone is our blood, so I told him I believed him, but we would have to wait until the baby was born Some months later, the baby arrived, we were all happy. We had an elaborate christening, everyone had forgotten about the saga surrounding the baby and had moved on. The mother of the baby was the devil incarnate! She was mean and manipulative, and was extorting my brother for money using the baby as a weapon. It was a really bad situation. My brother got custody of the baby later, because the environment the mother was living in was bad for the child’s health. As the baby was growing up, I noticed she looked nothing like any of us. She was the perfect image of her mother. She had bow legs, bigger gums and a large abdomen which are things we don’t have in our family. I reminded my brother about his suspicions about the pregnancy, and what he had told me before and advised him that the baby wasn’t his. He accused me of wanting to ruin his relationship with the baby, and I couldn’t believe he said that to me so I left it like that, and never mentioned anything about it again One day, he phoned me to tell me that he had something to show me. I went over to his house, and he pulled out a DNA test result which proved that he wasn’t the father. He was looking really devastated. I told him things would be fine. I called my parents to inform them, and my dad told us we had to return the child to its mother as it is a taboo in our culture to raise a bastard in your home. We called the family of the girl and explained things to them, and we went to take the baby back to them. We went through every legal procedure, and documented everything that had happened. Needless to say, she still couldn’t explain who the baby’s biological father could be. I do miss the baby a lot. I still see her as part of our family, even if she wasn’t biologically ours. She isn’t having the best of care with her family now and it hurts me so much. I had grown so fond of her and I’m still trying to talk my dad into adopting her. I’m hoping he will see reason and allow us to do that. In my heart, she’s still ours Edit one: Wow, almost 1k upvotes. Thanks so much everyone for the kind words and support. However, to those who condemn some of our actions, I quite understand and appreciate your criticism. We all are here to learn, and I have learned a lot.

Sometimes links are used to validate a statement made in your blog and sometimes they are used for directing traffic or potential customers from one place to another. But, as the owner of a small business, you should know where to put the nofollow tag on links of different sources before using them in your content or website. Below, one of the top [LINKED_TEXT: Digital marketing companies Maryland] [URL: https://auxiliumtechnology.com/] explains where to use the tag and where not to. Links to Follow Anything connected internally should never have nofollow on them. Internal linking is done to make the pages more visible and get more traffic on the website. So even if a visitor is reading the blog page, a link to an internal page will not hurt the overall website traffic. Sometimes you should also use links without a nofollow tag to validate your content from a high-quality source. Not To Follow Links Logically, links are used more for search engines and less for visitors. Though you should always prove a statement since people now don’t trust everything written by a picture on the internet. But at the same time, you should also keep in my mind whether to make it count as a vote for that site on search engines or not. You can put nofollow on third-party links that provide a similar service or a company with a low-quality reputation on the search engines."},{"instruction":"Which paper is used for origami?","output":"I would recommend 80g per square meter paper type, which is the best paper for Origami, but you can use basically any type of paper.

She was popular at school because she was good at academics, captain of the school's basketball team, and brave(a little rude, just a little). We were in the same class from sixth, but I never once did talk to her(obviously). It was a warm afternoon, and we were heading back home just as the last bell rang. That day I had to keep my lunch basket on the previous rack, so I went to fetch it. So as I completely bent down to take it, she grabbed his ball on the same shelf.

At that time, I had job offers from reputed companies in Bangalore and Mumbai with attractive pay scale. Finally after discussing with friends and family, I decided to choose EY. Today, i can proudly say that i made the right decision. Yes, the journey at EY has been amazing and filled with learnings. How is it amazing? Well, there are countless factors that i would like to share with you but i will summarise in few points. Professional growth: If I compare my knowledge with the time I joined EY, there is a huge improvement. Both in terms of technical and functional knowledge, I have learned a lot. Because you get to work on really challenging and innovative projects, you have to continuously improve your technical skills. Also most of the times you will have to engage with foreign clients which will improve your business communication skills to next level. If a company is helping you improve your technical as well as functional skills, I can’t ask for anything better. Tons of job offer from other companies: There was a time when I graduated from college and i was hunting for jobs all day and night. I used to send lot of requests to HRs and recruiters for job interview. Now time has completely changed, I receive linkedIn requests and many other Job portal requests at least 1-2 companies every week. I try to politely say no to all the recruiters. It is all because of EY brand. If you are passionate about career, make your best efforts to get into EY. Due to high competition, you might need to put little extra effort but I can guarantee that it will be worth your time.

Having travelled all over the world and lived in diverse places, in my experience, there are 'picky' eaters everywhere. It is a matter of shades of meaning, as Yves points out so well. I might also say that many picky eaters are children, again from my own experience and observations. Being brought up in a very traditional Māori home and environment, the absolute worst thing which was always avoided was wasting food. The notion of the sins of 'moumou kai' is inbuilt into our social and cultural DNA. We therefore learned to try and eat everything. If we didn't like anything (and I have to say there was nothing I ever really hated) we simply didn't eat it or have it served on a plate. This was not so much a matter of parental indulgence as an avoidance of 'moumou kai' so again, this principle of not allowing 'moumou kai' kicked in in a very pragmatic way. Why serve something which would be essentially wasted and in breach of cultural laws? It seems a very practical approach today even. So, I will try everything and anything today, as an adult. As a child, I was lactose and milk intolerant and also not able easily to digest fatty things. I cannot eat milk or cream and overtly fatty things, however, I love traditional things like smoked 'tuna' (eel); 'kanga wai' (fermented corn); 'kumara' (sweet potato); 'taro' and various 'kaimoana' (seafoods) and on the other side of the equation am a gourmet chef. In different places I have eaten insects, cat, dog, fermented fish and so on. Our 'tūpuna' (ancestors) ate 'huhu' (a grub which tastes like chicken or pork) and many other things, grown and gathered; caught and prepared. They were healthy. Today, we eat a lot of vegetarian food - 95% - and eat little fat other than virgin olive oil and coconut oil. I am not a big fan of meat and concerns about fish and seafood being polluted and contaminated are also there. We eat organic and grow much of our own fruit and vegetables.

They send out the BVL before they start to process your application. The BVL is just IRCC telling you they have received your biometrics and they will keep your biometrics on file for 10 years. You do not have to submit biometrics again for any visa or permit applications during the biometrics validity period. Once you have submitted your biometrics then IRCC will begin to process your study permit application. It starts with an eligibility check. If your application passes the eligibility check IRCC will ask you to submit your medical exam and they will begin your background check. All of the documents and information in your study permit application will be verified during the background check. At the same time your completed medical exam will be sent to a CIC medical officer for review. Once those are complete you will receive a decision letter telling you if your application was approved or denied. The average processing time for a study permit application is 7 weeks. If you are from a country with slow or uncooperative government agencies or financial institutions it may take longer."},{"instruction":"US is threatening to downgrade ties with India over its planned purchase of S400 missiles from Russia.

Although the S400 has seen field usage throughout Syria the patriot missiles have been battle tested during the Iraq invasion. The Americans have the THAAD Missile system which is predominantly used by South Korea against the DPRk as a deterrent. Overall S400 seems a better option for India considering 50%plus of our weapons are imported.

Broadly, you should have 60 to 80 lumens per square foot for a kitchen (more than for most any other room). Multiply that by the area of the kitchen (e.g. 70 lumens/ sq ft x 200 sq feet = 14,000 lumens). If you’re using 4-foot fluorescent tubes, like these: look at the specifications and see that they are 2850 lumens per tube, so 14,000 / 2850 = 5 tubes. A single 6-tube fixture would meet the lumens per square foot goal, but a single fixture casts more shadows than two or three smaller fixtures. 6 tubes at 32 watts each = 192 watts total (for a kitchen of that size), but it would take about 5 times more wattage for incandescent fixtures due to their lower energy efficiency, in lumens per watt. In summary, focus on lumens (amount of light), not watts (energy consumed to make those lumens)."},{"instruction":"Sometimes when I'm on a WhatsApp call, the app suddenly says call on hold.

In physics, string theory represents a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. For example, take a piece of wood. Inside it you would find millions of atoms bonded together. Inside every atom there is a nucleus. The atomic nucleus consists of nucleons—protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are made of quarks. The string theory states that inside quarks there are strings which vibrate at different frequencies causing the property of the substance. Now how does this unify all the laws?] In physics we got 4 fundamental laws that underpin the universe: gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. Gravity is described by Einstein's beautiful mathematics of curved space and time. But the other three forces are written in the language of quantum mechanics. And these two methods are completely incompatible. Presently the string theory says: Various vibrations of this stringy stuff correspond to each of the fundamental particles producing the properties of gravity, light and other elementary substances and laws. But the mathematics of string theory is a little strange, and in placing the pieces together, physicists needed to add more and more dimensions of space to make their theories work, many more than the three we experience in our everyday lives. For the string theory to work, we don't merely need to put four dimensions but 11 dimensions! The very idea of extra dimensions dates back to the 19s when a German mathematician named Theodore Kalua suggested a very bold and in some ways very bizarre idea. He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of that is in addition to left-right back-forth and up-down. Kaluza was a man of theory. He could even risk his life for theories but we as practical minded people might ask if there are extra dimensions then where are they? We can't perceive them. it's a possibility that the dimensions might come in two varieties. There might be big easy to see dimensions but there might also be tiny curled up dimensions curled up so small even though they're all around us that we don't see them. Let's consider an example of a wire hung a hundred metres apart from you. From our naked eyes we would assume and consider the wire as 2 dimensional. But let's say there are ants on the wire, they could move in any direction and for them those wires would be 3 dimensional. Therefore it is a possibility that the extra dimensions are extremely small for our naked eyes to observe. Some physicists feel that the theorists on the string theory bandwagon are heading down a dead-end path in the search for ultimate physics, and others feel it's very promising. In fact, we absolutely don't know. We don't know if any of our ideas are truly inching a way towards the ultimate theory, or if a completely alternative approach is required. In fact, we simply don't know if a grand unified theory barely exists. But this will not stop physicists from pursuing their search."},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"\\"Sharp\\" is a poor choice of words.
