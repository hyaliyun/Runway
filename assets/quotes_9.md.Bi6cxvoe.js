User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece. John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film. Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same. Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the \\"clown\\" mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times!  Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  Which friend didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase?  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","output":"Andy is the friend who didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. Let's delve a bit deeper into this. HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme which plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of cholesterol in our bodies. In individuals with high cholesterol, the inhibition of this enzyme can play a crucial role in reducing cholesterol levels. Drugs that achieve this are called statins. Statins are a commonly prescribed medication to treat high cholesterol. They work by blocking the action of the liver enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, thereby reducing the production of cholesterol. When less cholesterol is produced, the level of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or 'bad' cholesterol is reduced, which in turn reduces the risk of developing heart diseases which are associated with high cholesterol levels. In the story you've provided, though both friends have high levels of cholesterol, only Ben sought medical help and was consequently prescribed cholesterol medication - likely in the form of a statin given the common use of these drugs. As such, he would be the one who took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. On the other hand, Andy, due to his carelessness, did not go to the doctor and therefore did not receive any such medication. Hence, he did not take a drug that would alter his HMG-CoA reductase levels. It's also worth noting that while statins are often effective, they function differently depending on individual genetic makeups due to the field of pharmacogenomics. This branch of knowledge explores the impact of individual genetic variations on drug response, which is why statins might considerably lower cholesterol in some people, have a moderate effect in others, or not be significantly effective in certain individuals. However, thanks to the diverse range of statins available, doctors can generally find an effective medication or combination for each individual. Therefore, it is crucial to seek medical advice when dealing with high cholesterol, like Ben did, rather than ignoring the problem as Andy has."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rajat Gupta, 63, denied illegally leaking boardroom secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, a former hedge fund manager now serving 11 years in prison. The jury acquitted Gupta, a former managing partner of consulting giant McKinsey & Co, of two other charges. Gupta could face up to 20 years in jail when he is sentenced on 18 October. Prosecutors said that, in secret recordings of conversations with Rajaratnam, Gupta shared corporate secrets as though \\"he was talking about what happened at a Yankee game yesterday\\". But defence lawyers told the jury that the use of phone records and FBI wiretaps only created the illusion of illegal business activities. \\"That is a gambit that can bamboozle people into thinking something was proven when it wasn't,\\" defence lawyer Gary Naftalis said. The trial focused on a phone call made to Rajaratnam on 23 September 2008, minutes after Gupta had listened to a private conference call discussing a 5bn (√Ç¬£3.2bn) investment in Goldman Sachs by Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway. The deal would be made public after stock markets closed that day. According to phone records, Rajaratnam bought 40m in Goldman Sachs stock moments after the phone call, earning nearly 1m. Gupta, who was born in India and educated at Harvard, becomes the most prominent corporate figure to be convicted in a sweeping probe into insider trading.

The key piece of evidence was a covertly recorded phone call made to Rajaratnam, following a private conference regarding Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway investing 5 billion dollars into Goldman Sachs. Directly after the call, Rajaratnam purchased a substantial amount of Goldman Sachs stock and made a large profit. Though Gupta's defense argued that the evidence merely created an illusion of illicit activity, the conviction holds meaningful implications concerning insider trading.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more clean clear air happens, how will it affect forming more crystals in the remains.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the steps in the fossilization process and consider the potential effects of the perturbation (more clean clear air) on each step. 1. An organism dies: The death of an organism is not directly affected by the increased presence of clean clear air.  2. Water seeps into the remains: Clean clear air might indirectly influence this step. With cleaner air, the environmental conditions may change slightly, potentially affecting water sources, precipitation, and patterns. However, this would be an indirect effect, and the process of water seeping into remains would not fundamentally change. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: Clean clear air does not directly impact the minerals dissolved in water forming crystals. The chemical process of minerals being deposited in the remains and forming crystals is not affected by the air composition. 4. Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden: Similarly, the hardening of the remains due to crystalized minerals is a chemical process not directly affected by the presence of clean clear air. The perturbation does not play a role in this step of the process. 5. The minerals form a fossil: Ultimately, the formation of a fossil is not directly influenced by the presence of clean clear air. Indirectly, the perturbation might slightly affect water and environmental conditions, but it would not significantly alter the process of fossil formation. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more clean clear air does not have a direct effect on the fossil formation process. Any indirect effects would be minimal and would not significantly change the course of the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article using the following points: Defense attorneys are expected to present oral arguments Tuesday. Edgar Tamayo Arias is scheduled to be executed in Texas on Wednesday. Mexico's government says the execution would violate international law. Tamayo was convicted in the 1994 killing of a Houston police officer. Article:","output":"Title: Execution of Edgar Tamayo Arias: A Controversial Case Involving International Law Introduction:  On Tuesday, defense attorneys are expected to present oral arguments in a last-ditch effort to halt the execution of Edgar Tamayo Arias. Arias, who is scheduled to be executed in Texas on Wednesday, was convicted for the 1994 killing of a Houston police officer. The impending execution has garnered international attention, as Mexico's government claims that it would violate international law. Step 1: Presenting defense attorneys' oral arguments Defense attorneys, making their case on Tuesday, are likely to emphasize the international law aspect of the case and argue that executing Tamayo would infringe upon his rights as a foreign national. Additionally, the defense may bring up any issues related to the legal process in the United States, such as potential violations of due process and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Step 2: Discussing Edgar Tamayo Arias's scheduled execution If the defense's arguments are not successful in court, Tamayo Arias faces execution on Wednesday, following the standard legal processes in Texas. His execution could lead to strained relations between the United States and Mexico, as Mexico's government has expressed their opposition to the execution on the grounds that it violates international law. Step 3: Explaining Mexico's government stance on the issue Mexico's government has taken a strong stand against the execution, arguing that it would violate international law, specifically the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR). Under VCCR, foreign nationals who are arrested or detained are entitled to contact their consulate for assistance. In Tamayo's case, the Mexican government asserts that he was never informed of his consular rights, which could have significantly impacted his trial and sentencing. Step 4: Addressing potential repercussions of execution If the execution proceeds as scheduled, it may have serious implications not only for U.S.-Mexico relations, but also for other foreign nationals facing criminal proceedings in the United States. The United States has a responsibility to comply with international treaties, and the execution of Tamayo Arias, under these circumstances, could undermine that commitment. Conclusion:  The case of Edgar Tamayo Arias highlights the intricate intersection of domestic criminal proceedings and international law. With the defense attorneys set to present their oral arguments on Tuesday, the future of Arias remains uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, this case serves as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance in ensuring that the rights of foreign nationals are upheld in the United States and that international obligations are respected."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As they engage in an action-packed game of cat and mouse, both Mukesh's past and Om's true intentions are slowly unraveled. Throughout the rollercoaster of emotions and suspense, Mukesh ultimately learns the truth about Om - that Om is the manifestation of his guilt, created by his subconscious.

Question: What newspaper does Ellsworth Toohey write for? Movie title: The Fountainhead Movie plot: Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) has just left university. He is told off by the dean (Paul Stanton), as he does not want to know anything about history or how buildings were built in the past; he is only interested in the modern possibilities of building. That forces the dean to take the matter on his own hands and expel him. But Roark has already decided that he wants to work for only one person: Henry Cameron (Henry Hull). Even Peter Keating (Ken Smith), his fellow student and good friend, advises him not to follow that career path, as Cameron was a renown architect thirty years before, but these days he is a finished man. Howard does not listen. He is admitted by Cameron because of the project he has designed, although Cameron himself tells him that he will be finished like him in a few years. Cameron recognises Roark's talents and hires him.Some years later, Cameron is making a scene of himself at the train station. He's drunk and buying copies of the yellow-press newspaper The Banner just to tear its pages away. The newsboy (Bob Alden) does not know what to do about it. A police officer (Paul Newlan) appears and is about to arrest him. Roark kindly takes him to their office. Cameron is a broken man: back at the office, he picks up a t-square and thrusts it into a window pane; then, he has a fit and passes out on the floor. Roark goes with him to hospital in an ambulance.

Given the following context:  Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at Downtown Recorders in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of 40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, Surfer Rosa. Along with Norton, two assistant recording engineers and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with \\"nearly a song a day\\" being recorded.Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to Carriage House Studios, a residential studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as mixing engineer, whom he had worked with at Fort Apache Studios. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including overdubbed guitars on \\"Debaser\\" and double tracking vocals on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being \\"There Goes My Gun\\" which was originally intended as a much faster H√ºsker D√º-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of Buddy Holly's Greatest Hits, in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, \\"If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ...\\" In a  Rolling Stone interview, Francis later recalled that \\"this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy\\". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including gated reverb to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the artist who's greatest hits album did the lead singer of the band that tried to \\"remain somewhat grungy\\" give to the man that added layers of guitars to songs?","output":"The full name of the artist is Charles Hardin Holley, better known as Buddy Holly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (I) Ants are apt to avoid water. Placing the legs of the picnic table in buckets holding water will allow you to eat peacefully without ants crawling up onto the table top. Also sprinkle the area with cinnamon or cayenne pepper as a no fuss deterrent.; (II) Ants are not keen on water. Place the legs of the picnic table on sheets of paper, which will allow you to eat peacefully without ants crawling up onto the table top. Also sprinkle the area with cinnamon or cayenne pepper as a no fuss deterrent.;","output":"(I) Ants are apt to avoid water. Placing the legs of the picnic table in buckets holding water will allow you to eat peacefully without ants crawling up onto the table top. Also sprinkle the area with cinnamon or cayenne pepper as a no fuss deterrent. Option (I) is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because placing the legs of the picnic table in buckets of water creates a physical barrier that ants cannot cross. Ants are generally not good at swimming or crossing water, so this method effectively deters them. On the other hand, Option (II) suggests placing the table legs on sheets of paper, which does not create an effective barrier for ants. They can easily walk over or crawl under the paper. In addition, both options mention using cinnamon or cayenne pepper as a deterrent, which can be effective because ants do not like the strong odors of these spices. However, the primary method of deterrence in option (I) is more effective than that in option (II)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: I heard that Jesse told Robin's parents about it because he saw the robbers and it was the right thing to do.  And I was wondering How would you describe Jesse? Choose from: - indifferent. - proud. - bored. Answer:","output":"Based on the situation you presented, Jesse would best be described as proud. Jesse is clearly an individual who takes pride in his actions, particularly in those that contribute positively to the welfare and safety of others. Seeing the robbers and making the decision to inform Robin's parents shows his proactive nature and willingness to involve himself in difficult situations for the good of others. When defining someone as proud, it's essential to note that it doesn't only imply personal pride over achievements but can also signify taking pride in contributing to the community and doing what's morally and ethically right. Jesse‚Äôs actions demonstrate his moral compass, which guides his choices and behaviors. The act of telling Robin's parents about the robbers, even though it may involve certain risks, indicates a significant level of courage and determination to do what is right, a typical attribute of a proud individual. His pride is not in achieving personal gain but in knowing he's made a valuable contribution to someone else's safety and peace of mind. There's no evidence of Jesse being indifferent or bored. Indifference suggests a lack of interest or concern, which is certainly not the case here; Jesse was proactive and engaged in the situation. Boredom implies a lack of stimulation or interest in one's surroundings or circumstances, whereas Jesse clearly demonstrated alertness, vigilance, and a keen understanding of the gravity of the situation. Therefore, suggesting that Jesse is proud characterizes him accurately as someone who prioritizes righteousness over personal inconvenience, takes pride in his values and ethical standards, and willingly takes action when needed. He demonstrates an admirable level of maturity and moral integrity, making 'proud' the most fitting description out of the options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and the Indus Valley Civilization in Ancient India (modern-day Pakistan and some parts of India). Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What machinery has lead to the  easily made and widespread use of cotton?","output":"The machinery that has led to the easily made and widespread use of cotton is the cotton gin. Invented by Eli Whitney in 1794, the cotton gin revolutionized the cotton industry by making the process of separating the cotton fibers from their seeds drastically quicker and easier.  Before the invention of the cotton gin, cotton processing was an incredibly labor-intensive task that required many hours and a significant amount of manual work. Workers had to pick the cotton from the plants in the field, and then each individual seed had to be painstakingly separated from the cotton fibers by hand. Each cotton boll contains numerous seeds, each surrounded by the cotton fiber, making this task quite arduous and time-consuming. The cotton gin mechanized this process. The machine works by pulling the cotton through a series of wire teeth that remove the seeds from the fibers. The seeds fall through a slot in the bottom of the machine, allowing the fibers to be pulled through and wound onto a spindle. This mechanization greatly improved the efficiency of cotton processing, allowing it to be done on a much larger scale and at a much faster pace. Even though there were initial issues around the patent for the cotton gin, with numerous legal contests over who held the true rights to the invention, Eli Whitney‚Äôs machine had an enormous impact on the cotton industry. It reduced the cost of cotton production and made it affordable for more people. This led to a boom in the cotton industry, particularly in the southern United States where cotton was a major crop. As a result, cotton became more widely available and was used more extensively in textile manufacturing, leading to its predominance in the market. Moreover, the invention of the cotton gin led to further industrialization in the textile industry. Innovations such as the spinning jenny, the power loom, and the spinning mule came after the cotton gin and further mechanized the process of turning cotton into cloth. They allowed textiles to be produced much more quickly and cheaply, making them more accessible to a greater number of people and further promoting the widespread use of cotton.  In sum, the invention of the cotton gin was instrumental in the widespread use of cotton as it made the processing of cotton far more efficient, drastically reducing the cost of production and enabling the mass production of cotton textiles. This crucial piece of machinery, along with later developments in textile machinery, revolutionized the textile industry and led to the dominance of cotton in the global textile market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are a few reasons for this interpretation: 1. The use of \\"thin\\" typically refers to something lacking substance, depth, or value. In this context, it seems to imply that the content in question might not be engaging, captivating, or able to maintain the audience's interest over the specified running time. 2. The term \\"stretched\\" also carries a negative connotation, as it suggests that the material is being extended or dragged out over the 80-minute running time. When something is stretched out, it can become tiresome or boring to the audience, as the original substance could lose its impact and be unable to sustain the prolonged exposure. 3. The phrase \\"nearly 80-minute running time\\" might be interpreted as excessive or unnecessarily long, which can contribute to the overall negative tone of the statement. Depending on the context, having an extended running time could be a negative factor, as it might take more time and effort to maintain the audience's engagement and interest. 4.

Background: Sherman Joseph Alexie, Jr. (born October 7, 1966) is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist, short story writer, poet, and filmmaker. His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington. His best-known book is The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (1993), a collection of short stories. Context: Alexie was born on October 7, 1966, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Washington. As a little child he lived on the Spokane Indian Reservation, located west of Spokane. His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of Colville, Choctaw, Spokane and European American ancestry. One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of Russian descent. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the cranial cavity. He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or mental disabilities if he survived. Alexie's surgery was successful; he suffered no mental damage but had other side effects.  His parents were alcoholics though his mother was a sober alcoholic. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a clerk at the Wellpinit Trading Post and had some other jobs.  Alexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids as well as endured abuse he described as \\"torture\\" from teachers who were white nuns. They called him \\"The Globe\\" because his head was larger than usual, due to the hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and bedwetting; he had to take strong drugs to control them. Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males. Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals. Question: Why was life at the reservation challenging to him?. Whats the answer?","output":"Life at the reservation was challenging for Sherman Alexie primarily because of his health issues and the social environment. Born with hydrocephalus, Alexie had to undergo brain surgery at six months old, which led to side effects such as seizures and bedwetting. These conditions excluded him from many activities that were considered rites of passage for young Indigenous males. Additionally, he faced constant teasing from other kids at the reservation school and endured abusive treatment from teachers who were white nuns. They called him \\"The Globe\\" due to his larger-than-usual head size resulting from his medical condition.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation -7240*k = -2239*k + 285057 for k, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable 'k' by moving all 'k' terms to one side of the equation. We will do this by adding 2239*k to both sides: -7240*k + 2239*k = -2239*k + 2239*k + 285057 This simplifies to: -5001*k = 285057 Step 2: Solve for 'k' by dividing both sides of the equation by -5001: -5001*k / -5001 = 285057 / -5001 This simplifies to: k = -57 So the solution to the equation -7240*k = -2239*k + 285057 is k = -57."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Lindsey Caroline Vonn (nee Kildow ; born October 18, 1984) is an American World Cup alpine ski racer on the US Ski Team. She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). Context: In her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France.  Vonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful.  On March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months.  In 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined. She was ninth in super-G, but failed to finish the giant slalom. She cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she has a strained relationship, for rattling her before the event. Question: What is the final race mentioned in the 2002-2005 period?

Here's the equation: -24*k - 92*k - 34*k = 80*k - 10350 First, let's add the 'k' parts together on both sides of the equal sign. On the left side, you have: (-24 - 92 - 34) * k When you do the math, it's: -150 * k Now, the equation looks like this: -150*k = 80*k - 10350 Next, let's move all the 'k' parts to one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 150*k to both sides: (-150*k) + 150*k = 80*k - 10350 + 150*k This simplifies to: 0 = 230*k - 10350 Now, we want to get rid of the 230 in 230*k. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 230: 230*k √∑ 230 = 10350 √∑ 230 This simplifies to: k = 45 So, the value of 'k' is 45."},{"instruction":"Q: Sasha was really upset and needed some cheering up.

Background: Stanley Donen ( DAWN-@n; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, both of which he co-directed with actor and dancer Gene Kelly. Other noteworthy films include Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Indiscreet, Damn Yankees!, Charade, and Two for the Road. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. Context: Stanley Donen was born in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the daughter of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis was born in August 1937. Although born to Jewish parents, he became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy as one of the few Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he \\"must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where everything seemed to be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me.\\" He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him.  Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance lessons in Columbia and performed at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took further dance lessons. One of his early instructors in New York was Ned Wayburn, who had taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910. After graduating from high school at sixteen, Donen attended the University of South Carolina for one summer semester, studying psychology. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott. The titular Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer Gene Kelly, who became a Broadway star in the role.  Abbott cast Donen in the chorus of his next Broadway show Best Foot Forward. He became the show's assistant stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best Foot Forward, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister. Question: Who was his mother ?

It is one of outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg's final health initiatives, which the New York City Department of Health proposed to the Board of Health in September. \\"Young children have a high risk of developing severe complications from influenza,\\" the Health Department said in a statement. \\"One-third of children under five in New York City do not receive an annual influenza vaccination, even though the vaccine safely and effectively protects them against influenza illness. Young children often pass influenza to other children and family members, who then spread the infection to others in the community.\\" The flu vaccine will be added to the seven other vaccines children under 5 are required to get, including measles, whooping cough and chicken pox. \\"We know that influenza is a serious illness which affects an estimated 15% to 40% of children during annual flu season,\\" said Dr. Jay Varma, who oversees infectious diseases as deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department. Richard Kanowitz, president of Families Fighting Flu, lost his daughter at age 4 to the virus. \\"This is great news for children,\\" he said. \\"Had the same law been in effect when my daughter was alive in 2004, she'd be alive today. She would not have gotten the flu.\\" \\"Only 60 percent of children under the age of 5 in New York City get vaccinated,\\" Dr. Varma said. \\"In New Jersey and Connecticut, where they have this requirement, it's 80%.\\" The issue of vaccinating children is controversial. One consistent claim is that vaccines can cause autism. \\"This was a very closed process,\\" said John Gilmore, director of the Manhattan-based Autism Action Network. \\"We will most likely be filing a lawsuit fairly soon to overturn this. From a legal standpoint, we see this as similar to the soda ban,\\" referring to the mayor's unsuccessful attempt to ban sugary drinks. Varma said the myths that flu shots can cause the flu, or worse, are just that, myths. \\"It does not cause you to get the flu; it does not cause you to get autism,\\" he said. The flu vaccine is available in two forms -- shot or nasal spray -- and children are required to get vaccinated by December 31. \\"To the extent that this saves lives, it's great news,\\" Kranowitz said. \\"I wish my daughter had had the vaccination because, I, as well as other parents, were unaware how the flu killed healthy children.

The woman driving (Jan Holden) is telling her boyfriend, Chris (Barry Lowe) to \\"Hold on, well get help soon, were coming to the main road.\\" He has a large dark blister on his face. He's delirious, grabs the steering wheel, and tries to run the car off the road. They enter a \\"T\\" intersection and nearly crash into the car Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Dunlevy) is driving. Quatermass gets out of his car and walks over to the other. He's very angry and shaken, but inquires about the burn on the man's face. The woman hands him some rock fragments and tells him they were responsible for the burn. She tells him they were in Winterton Flats for a picnic. Quatermass helps push the car back onto the road, when Chris bolts from the car. They wrestle him back into the car. Credits roll. (Note: The British Version is called Quatermass 2, while the American version of this movie was titled Enemy from Space.)At the Rocket project we see a building with a radar antenna mounted on the roof. Two operators are watching the screen. They notice scores of objects coming down slowly. They track the objects to one hundred miles north of their location. As they reset the equipment, Quatermass drives up. He notices the antenna setting and is very annoyed. He scolds Brand (William Franklyn) and Marsh (Bryan Forbes) for what he perceives as unauthorized use of the scanner.He tells Marsh and Brand that tomorrow none of them may have jobs. He gives Marsh the stone fragments and tells him to have them analyzed and classified. He apologizes to Brand and tells him that the moon project is to be cancelled. He outlines the project scope in front of a scale model--to build a colony on the moon. As he prepares to get in his car he points to the rocket ship on the launch pad and tells Brand, \\"Can you still bear to look at it? The sum total of our achievement up to now--one Rocket, crewless, untried.\\" He leaves for the rocket launch area. Brand returns to the radar room and notices more...

Context: The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed. Answer:","output":"It is beneficial to limit main memory usage because accessing main memory is often slow compared to the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and control units. By utilizing the special memory cells called registers, which can be read and written to much more rapidly, the computer can avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed, thus greatly increasing its speed.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Ex-Mizzou recruit Tony Mitchell ready to comeback at North Texas Though Tony Mitchell still looked like a raw prospect in Latvia, he could develop into a first-round pick. Two recruits from the Rivals.com Class of 2010 top 20 never appeared in a game last season. The first, everyone knows. The NCAA deemed him a professional due to benefits he received from a professional club in Turkey, and Kentucky's Internet fan-army started a T-shirt campaign to \\"free\\" him from the collegiate ban. Ultimately all he did was serve as a student assistant coach and train in Lexington. He still managed to be picked No. 3 overall in last month's NBA draft. Things worked out well for Enes Kanter. The second missing prospect was sitting in hotel lobby in Riga, Latvia, earlier this month, wearing USA warmup gear, explaining where he's been playing basketball for the past year: on his own in gyms around Dallas, or in rec-center pickup games on the campus of North Texas. \\"This whole wait has been tough,\\" he said. \\"I felt real rusty when I showed up [in Latvia], but I'm starting to get back in the groove.\\" As he spoke, the Serbian, Croatian and Lithuanian national teams were filing by him on their way to the lunch buffet. Those players -- his opponents in the FIBA U19 World Championships, in which the U.S. finished fifth -- have been his only meaningful competition since he played with the Americans in last summer's qualifying tournament in San Antonio. He had signed a letter of intent with Missouri, but was never allowed on campus, and then resurfaced at North Texas. The question this July remains the same as it was last July: Will things work out for Tony Mitchell? Mitchell's case received far less media attention than did Kanter's, in part because Mitchell wasn't at Kentucky, and in part because his issues involved academics, not compensation. The 6-8 power forward was, at No. 12 overall in Rivals' rankings, the highest-rated player ever to sign with Mizzou, but his high school transcripts drew major red flags from the NCAA. In his junior year, as part of a quest to better his grades to be come eligible to play college basketball, he was led astray to an unaccredited prep school in Miami. He takes the blame for it now (\\"It was my mistake,\\" he says, \\"I should have checked up on it first\\"), even though he was just 16 when he went to Center of Life Christian Academy, trusting the advice of an AAU coach. Only a fraction of Mitchell's work at Center of Life Christian would count toward his NCAA eligibility. He transferred to Dallas' Pinkston High for his senior season and tried to retake core courses at an impermissible pace; a local school district investigation led to his transcripts being invalidated, and his graduation was delayed while he struggled with a state exit test. Mitchell remained at home in Dallas during what would've been his first college semester, and his eligibility saga dragged into January, when he got word that he'd never be able to play for the Tigers. Forced to choose between the junior college route or attending a four-year school as a partial qualifier, Mitchell enrolled at North Texas, where he's now a student paying in-state tuition. Mean Green coach Johnny Jones had aggressively recruited Mitchell out of high school and is hoping for a second chance to coach the local phenom. \\"We felt we were right there,\\" Jones said, \\"So when he committed to Missouri, it was like we lost a battle.\\" Mitchell needs to pass 24 credit hours to be eligible to practice with UNT on Dec. 17, following the conclusion of its fall semester, and potentially debut on Dec. 18 at home against LSU. Until then, he can't work out with the team, and has had to settle for dominating at the campus rec center, where he's become an intramural-league legend*. (* An actual message-board post inspired by one of Mitchell's games in February: \\"While getting beat by 30 in my rec game tonight I witnessed the greatest basketball player I've ever seen in person (not in the NBA)... Tony Mitchell. While playing in front of a crowd of about 100, at about 30% effort, he showed just how much better he was than anyone on that court. You can just tell that he is legit NBA prospect. My favorite was his between the legs power dunk on a fast break. I heart him. The end.\\" [sic]) Mitchell said that his progress toward that 24-credit goal was \\"beyond half done,\\" and that he's on track to join the North Texas team for the bulk of its season. It should be noted that he told me last summer that everything would be fine at Missouri, which didn't turn out to be the case, so his start date shouldn't be viewed as a lock. But Jones, too, expresses optimism that Mitchell will suit up this year, based on what the coach has seen out of his 2011 coursework. \\"Tony's been so focused and determined to have the opportunity to play,\\" Jones said. \\"If he stays that focused, he'll be on target to play on Dec. 18.\\" The one coach Mitchell has been able to play for this year is George Mason's Paul Hewitt, who headed the U.S. U19 team and considered the 6-8 forward a key defensive contributor. With potential interior stars such as Ohio State's Jared Sullinger and Kentucky's Terrence Jones and Anthony Davis turning down invites, the U.S.' only other frontcourt players were Florida's Patric Young, Illinois' Meyers Leonard, Creighton's Doug McDermott and Butler's Khyle Marshall, and Mitchell ended up playing 15.8 minutes per game backing up Young and McDermott. As raw as Mitchell is skill-wise -- the fact that he hadn't been in a college program for a year was evident in Latvia -- he still managed to post attention-grabbing numbers by crashing the glass and flying in from the weak side for blocks. A per-28-minute, tempo-free analysis of the U19s published at In-The-Game.org ranked Mitchell's efficiency rating (20.4) second in the entire tournament, behind only Lithuania's Jonas Valanciunas, who was the No. 5 overall pick in this year's draft and by far the best player in Riga. Mitchell only averaged half as many minutes (15.8 mpg) as Valanciunas, but had a higher rebounding rate (0.47 rpm) and block rate (0.11 bpm) than the future Raptors center. NBA scouts had been especially curious to see Mitchell, who as a high school senior beat out Baylor's Perry Jones -- a possible top-three pick in 2012 -- for the Dallas Morning News' area player of the year honors. And while Mitchell didn't do anything in Latvia that particularly wowed NBA evaluators, he made enough of an impact to warrant future visits to Denton, where he could grow into a first-round pick. \\"He's a great athlete, but he's just playing on instinct right now,\\" one scout said. \\"He hasn't developed a feel for the game yet.\\" Mitchell's athleticism alone will be enough to make him stand out in the Sun Belt, a conference that rarely features athletes of his caliber, and never lands recruits of his status. He longingly watched Missouri games on TV for the first half of 2010-11, wondering what he might've done in the Tigers' frontcourt, and thinks he could help the Mean Green, who lost their opening NCAA tournament game last March, pull off upsets in the postseason. \\"I'll be trying to make a huge impact right away,\\" he said. \\"I should make a huge impact. I'll be playing to win, and entertain at the same time -- you know, throwing down dunks, the usual.\\" It was hard not to laugh at Mitchell's secondary goal of \\"entertainment,\\" but that comment as a whole was indicative of how overeager he is to get on the floor in Denton. He's desperate to do something, anything, to prove that he's still an elite player, as opposed to a cautionary tale of a once-hyped recruit. All of his American frontcourt mates should benefit from their international experience; for Young and Leonard, it could set the stage for breakout sophomore seasons as they take on starting roles stateside. But for Mitchell, it was something else entirely: a respite from his academic purgatory, a reminder of how far he has to go to catch up to his peers, and for the first time in a year, the chance to function as part of a team. He needed the U19 trip more than did anyone else on the roster. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Former Mizzou recruit Tony Mitchell, now at the University of North Texas, discusses his basketball journey, struggles with NCAA eligibility, and hopes for a successful future.

Doctors usually prefer to give patients vaccines instead of medications because the","output":"latter often has side effects and does not provide long-term immunity. Vaccines, on the other hand, allow the body to build a natural defense against various diseases, thus preventing health issues from arising in the first place. Additionally, vaccines can be cost-effective and significantly reduce the risk of outbreaks and infections within communities. One day, in the busy city of Metropolia, a young doctor named Dr. Amelia Hayes was working tirelessly at Eden Health Clinic, a well-renowned medical facility known for its cutting-edge research and healthcare services. Dr. Hayes was passionate about preventative care, specifically through vaccination, and she displayed a genuine dedication to the wellbeing of her patients. On this particular day, Dr. Hayes received news about an emerging virus that had recently surfaced in a small village near the outskirts of Metropolia. The World Health Organization (WHO) had issued an advisory about the spread of this virus and called for immediate efforts to curtail the outbreak before it could escalate into a pandemic. Eager to find a solution, Dr. Hayes gathered a team of her most trusted colleagues, including Dr. Aaron Chen, a brilliant virologist, and Dr. Stephanie Michaels, a prominent epidemiologist. Together, they began their research on the new virus, painstakingly analyzing its structure, transmission, and potential impact on human health. Over the course of several weeks, the team of medical professionals dug deep into their studies and began to notice unique patterns in the virus' genetic makeup. This discovery proved instrumental, as it offered vital clues on devising an effective vaccine. Working day and night, Dr. Hayes and her team started developing and testing various formulations, driven by the urgent need to safeguard the residents of Metropolia and beyond. News of the impending virus threat caught the attention of the media, causing widespread paranoia and fear among the public. Desperate citizens flocked to Eden Health Clinic, pleading with Dr. Hayes and her peers for any treatment or preventative measures available. However, the process of creating a safe and effective vaccine took time, and the team had to delicately balance meeting the expectations of the public while staying true to their commitment to scientific research. Eventually, after numerous iterations and rigorous clinical trials, Dr. Hayes and her team succeeded in producing a promising vaccine candidate demonstrating both safety and efficacy against the new virus. Metropolia‚Äôs governing authorities promptly approved the vaccine for emergency use, allowing Dr. Hayes to initiate a mass vaccination campaign. Logistics proved to be quite a challenge, with limited resources and a frightened populace. However, Dr. Hayes was determined not to let these obstacles deter her from saving lives. She collaborated with various governmental and non-governmental organizations to roll out an organized and efficient vaccination drive, starting with the most vulnerable individuals and the frontline healthcare workers. Strict hygiene protocols, public awareness campaigns, and the tireless dedication of healthcare professionals like Dr. Hayes gradually diminished the prevalence of the virus. As the months passed, Metropolia and the surrounding regions continued to witness a steady decline in viral infections, thanks to Dr. Hayes and her team's persistent efforts. The newly-developed vaccine became a prime example of how preventative healthcare through vaccination saves lives, time, and resources, as well as spares countless people from unnecessary pain and suffering. In the end, Metropolia managed to avert what could have been a catastrophic pandemic, all due to the timely response, scientific prowess, and relentless determination of doctors like Amelia Hayes. The community realized the importance of vaccine-driven preventative healthcare, learned to appreciate and trust the expertise of medical professionals, and started to prioritize vaccination within their healthcare systems. Through a combination of education, empathy, and relentless determination, Dr. Hayes not only managed to save her city from an unnerving viral outbreak but also reminded the world of the power and significance of vaccine-driven preventative care, inspiring future generations to follow in her footsteps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Monsignor William Lynn, the highest-ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse, was found guilty Friday of one count of child endangerment. He was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and a conspiracy charge to protect a priest accused of abuse. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against his co-defendant, the Rev. James Brennan, who was charged with attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy and endangering the welfare of a child. Lynn was taken into custody after Friday's verdict, when the judge revoked his bail. His lawyer, Jeffrey Lindy, derided the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing, calling it \\"an unspeakable miscarriage of justice (for) a 61-year-old man with no prior record and long established ties to the community.\\" \\"Because of the","output":"nature of the case and the gravity of the charges, Monsignor Lynn's conviction represents a monumental moment within both the Catholic Church and the larger discussions on sexual abuse within religious institutions. While many supporters argue that he has long served the community and should not be jailed immediately, the fact remains that his actions, or lack thereof, had a direct impact on the lives and well-being of vulnerable children. For years, cases of sexual abuse within the Church have been met with varying degrees of dismissal, denial, and secrecy. As allegations continue to surface, it has become clear that the Catholic Church's hierarchy has often been complicit in shielding abusers from the consequences of their actions, thereby allowing the abuse to continue. With the conviction of a high-ranking official like Monsignor Lynn, a glaring spotlight has been cast on the Church, forcing it to confront its patterns of internal mismanagement and cover-ups. The verdict in Monsignor Lynn's case is indicative of a significant shift in societal attitudes towards sexual abuse within religious organizations. As the public becomes less tolerant of abuse, figures like Monsignor Lynn serve as stark reminders of the need for transparency, accountability, and immediate action within the Church.  Following the conviction, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia issued a statement expressing sorrow for the victims, emphasizing their commitment to supporting survivors and pledging to make necessary changes to prevent future abuse. The verdict has undeniably served as a deterrent for other religious institutions to be more diligent in addressing allegations of abuse and prioritizing the safety and welfare of their congregants‚Äîespecially the most vulnerable members.  In the coming months, Lynn's defense team will likely appeal the verdict and seek leniency in sentencing. While the outcome of these attempts remains uncertain, one undeniable fact is clear: the Catholic Church, and religious institutions as a whole, now face heightened scrutiny in addressing the sexual abuse crisis. As more survivors continue to come forward, the Church must listen, respond, and make meaningful reforms to protect, support, and seek justice for those who have suffered at the hands of clergy. In conclusion, although opinions surrounding Monsignor Lynn's immediate detainment may differ, it cannot be denied that his conviction serves as a seismic shift in addressing sexual abuse within religious institutions. It signifies a move towards greater accountability and an unwavering demand for the protection of vulnerable individuals. Society can only hope that this case marks the beginning of a new era in which faith-based organizations take meaningful steps to prevent any form of abuse from occurring in the future, and provide unyielding support to those impacted by the actions of malignant individuals.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When he was a small boy he got off to a poor start in arithmetic. His teacher got the idea that he had no ability in arithmetic, and told his parents what she thought in order that they would not expect too much of him. In this way, they too developed the idea, \\"Isn't it too bad that Alfred can't do arithmetic?\\" He accepted their mistaken estimate of his ability, feeling that it was useless to try, and that he was very poor at arithmetic, just as they expected.  One day he became very angry at the teacher and the other students because they laughed when he said he saw how to do a problem which none of the other students had been able to solve.  Adler succeeded in solving the problem. This gave him confidence. He rejected the idea that he couldn't do arithmetic and was determined to show them that he could. His anger and his new found confidence stimulated him to go at arithmetic problems with a new spirit. He now worked with interest, determination, and purpose, and he soon became extraordinarily good at arithmetic. He not only proved that he could do arithmetic, but he learned early in life from his own experience that, if a person goes at a job with determination and purpose, he may astonish himself as well as others by his ability.  This experience made him realize that many people have more ability than they think they have, and that lack of success is as often the result of lack of knowledge of how to apply one's ability, lack of confidence, and lack of determination as it is the result of lack of ability.

Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end? How to swim backstroke perfectly  Keep your body flat like a plank.  When you're doing the backstroke, you want your body to lay as flat on the surface of the water as possible. The smaller your profile in the water, the less resistance you'll feel as you swim and the easier it will be to go fast.  (a). Position your body as you begin the backstroke. First, do your standard front stroke, followed by a mid stroke, followed by a ste stroke (which is a fairly accurate stroke).. (b). Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is ok but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible.. (c). When your body is submerged, keep your feet about shoulder width apart. If you swim along a rigid surface, you'll be able to change direction when you rotate your toes.. (d). Balance your weight on the balls of your feet and keep your shoulders down and in profile. Pass your arms and legs out to your sides..","output":"Correct answers:  (b). Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is ok but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible.. (c). When your body is submerged, keep your feet about shoulder width apart. If you swim along a rigid surface, you'll be able to change direction when you rotate your toes.. Explanation: Option (a) is incorrect because it refers to different strokes and not specifically on how to swim backstroke perfectly, which is the main topic of the paragraph. The terms 'standard front stroke', 'mid stroke', and 'ste stroke' are also not relevant in swimming backstroke.  Option (d) is wrong as it suggests to 'balance your weight on the balls of your feet'. This doesn't apply to swimming backstroke as you are on your back and not standing or balancing on your feet. On the other hand, Option (b) correctly adds to the instructions by giving advice on hip position during backstroke, which indeed should be as close to the surface as possible to maintain the flat body position.  Finally, Option (c) provides relevant advice on foot positioning and movement while swimming backstroke, hence it's a correct choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Colts, the Broncos traveled to Nashville to face the Tennessee Titans at LP Field. After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos took the lead in the second quarter, as quarterback Kyle Orton threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal. The Titans responded, with quarterback Vince Young throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kenny Britt. The Broncos would retake the lead, with a 36-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but The Titans replied, when placekicker Rob Bironas nailed an incredible 55-yard field goal just before halftime. In the third quarter, the Broncos took the lead again, with another 36-yard field goal by Prater, but Titans' wide receiver Marc Mariani returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, putting Tennessee ahead 17-13. Tennessee's lead was narrowed, with a 35-yard field goal by Prater, but was increased again with a 46-yard field goal by Bironas. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos pulled ahead, when Orton completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Correll Buckhalter. After the Titans fumbled the ensuing kickoff, the Broncos increased their lead with 28 seconds remaining, with a 36-yard field goal by Prater. The Broncos' defense thwarted the Titans' final desperation drive of the game.

Nathan Charles Buckley (born 26 July 1972) is a former professional Australian rules football player, commentator and coach, best known for his time as captain of the Collingwood Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is currently the senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club. He is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the top 50 players of all time. Buckley won the inaugural Rising Star Award, in 1993, then went on to become one of the game's elite, captaining Collingwood between 1999 and 2007, winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player afield in the 2002 Grand Final despite playing in the losing team, only the third player in history to do so, the Brownlow Medal in 2003, winning Collingwood's Best and Fairest award, the Copeland Trophy, six times and named in the Collingwood Team of the Century. After months of speculation, Buckley signed a 5-year deal with the Collingwood Football Club. He was the assistant coach for the seasons of 2010 and 2011; he then became head coach in 2012, having taken over from Mick Malthouse, initially signing for a period of three years.  Collingwood began the 2012 season shakily, losing to Hawthorn in round 1 and being thrashed by Carlton in round 3. However they recovered to win their next ten matches and finish the home-and-away season in fourth place with a record of 16-6. They were defeated by Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final before bouncing back to defeat West Coast in the Semi Final. However they lost comfortably to eventual premier Sydney in the Preliminary Final at ANZ Stadium to bring an end to the 2012 season.  2013 started poorly for the Magpies, slumping to a 5-4 record after 9 games. They couldn't quite find the consistency of previous seasons and finished the year in sixth place with a 14-8 record. They played Port Adelaide in their Elimination Final at the MCG and slumped to a shock 24-point loss, which caused Buckley to call into question the club's culture.  Buckley's contract was extended until the end of 2016 by Collingwood in early March 2014, however Collingwood produced a poor performance in round 1 and lost to 2013 grand finalists Fremantle by 70 points. They ended up missing the finals to finish 12th partly due to an injury crisis. Collingwood started the 2015 season at 3-1 as of Round 4 and a gutsy win against Essendon on Anzac Day in 100th centenary of Gallipoli landing.  At the end of Collingwood's 2017 season on 28 August 2017, Buckley was given a two-year contract extension by the club after it undertook a review of the entire football club.

Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (; October 11, 1884 - November 7, 1962) was an American politician, diplomat and activist. She served as the First Lady of the United States from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office, making her the longest serving First Lady of the United States.  Roosevelt served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952. President Harry S. Truman later called her the \\"First Lady of the World\\" in tribute to her human rights achievements. Roosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant. She hoped the project could become a model for \\"a new kind of community\\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for. Her husband enthusiastically supported the project.  After an initial, disastrous experiment with prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt's specifications, this time with \\"every modern convenience\\", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time. Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination.  Roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years, as well as spending most of her own income on the project. However, the project was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a \\"communist plot\\", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes also opposed the project, citing its high per-family cost. Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941, when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss.  Later commentators generally described the Arthurdale experiment as a failure. Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a \\"utopia\\" compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, \\"I don't know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars. But I do.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: were the people of Arthurdale grateful to her?","output":"Yes, the people of Arthurdale were grateful to her.

Upon completing the cartwheel, Rex felt a mixture of joy, accomplishment, and relief wash over him. Deep down, there had always been a lurking fear that he had completely lost his athletic touch as he left his gymnastics days behind in high school. This fear was often intensified as he found himself growing increasingly distant from the rigorous and exhilarating physical activities that he once adored. However, his friend's encouragement to simply try a cartwheel on the beach brought about a powerful realization. It showed Rex that, even with the passage of time and the changes that life had taken him through, the resilience and skill that had been cultivated during his time as a gymnast had not entirely vanished. In many ways, this simple cartwheel on the beach symbolized a reawakening for Rex. It proved that he had not, and could not, fully lose touch with the athletic aspect of his identity that had once played such a fundamental role in his life. It was a reminder that the skills he had honed years ago as a gymnast, though seemingly dormant, were very much alive, waiting to be rediscovered and explored. This realization opened up a realm of possibilities for Rex. Emboldened by the successful cartwheel, he began to seek out ways to reintegrate physical activities and gymnastics elements into his daily life. The world around him became a playground once again, as he found joy in practicing handstands, jumps, and balancing exercises. In time, Rex started attending local gymnastics classes, where he connected with like-minded individuals who shared his passion for the sport. Together, they pushed each other to refine their techniques and reach new heights, drawing from their past experiences and the unshakable spirit of determination that burned within each of them. Rex's newfound enthusiasm for gymnastics also had a ripple effect on the rest of his life. It taught him that growth often stems from stepping outside of our comfort zones and reconnecting with our past, even when we may not think that we have anything left to learn. Additionally, it demonstrated the power of encouragement and willingness to try something as seemingly simple as a cartwheel on the beach. Ultimately, finding the confidence to rediscover his gymnastics skills turned out to be one of the most valuable moments of Rex's life. Not only did it renew his love for gymnastics and help him forge meaningful connections with others, but it also served as a reminder of the importance of never giving up on a part of ourselves that once made us feel truly alive.

Rudy and his Chicana housekeeper both assure him that because of the plant's production level, several safety regulations are ignored or worked against; workers have no time to make sure that the manure coming from the intestines stays away from the meat. Don later meets with Harry Rydell, executive VP of Mickey's, who admits being aware of the issue, but is not concerned. Amber is a young, upbeat employee of Mickey's, studying for college and living with her mother Cindy. While her life seems to be set, she continually faces the contrast between her current career and her own ambition, emphasized by her two lazy co-workers, Brian and Andrew, who, having heard of armed robberies at fast food restaurants in the area, start planning their own. Amber and Cindy are visited by Cindy's brother Pete, who encourages Amber to leave town and start a real career. Amber eventually meets a group of young activists, Andrew, Alice, and Paco, who plan to liberate cattle from Uni-Globe as their first act of rebellion. They proceed to sneak up to a holding pen at the plant, but after breaking down the fence, they are shocked that the cattle make no attempt to leave. Upon hearing the police, they retreat and contemplate why the cattle decided to stay in confinement. Raul, his love interest Sylvia, and Sylvia's sister Coco are illegal immigrants from Mexico,...

Help as much as you can. I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. who is the author?

What is the medical name for the large intestine of the human body?","output":"The medical term for the large intestine of the human body is called the Colon. The colon is a vital part of the digestive system that plays an important role in processing and eliminating waste products and absorbing water, electrolytes, and vitamins produced by enteric bacteria. The colon consists of multiple parts which together help in carrying out these functions. The large intestine, commonly referred to as the colon, is divided into several segments, each with its specific names and functions. These segments are: 1. The cecum: This is where the colon begins and is the first section of the large intestine. The cecum is a pouch-like structure that connects the colon to the small intestine, specifically the ileum, through the ileocecal valve. The appendix, a small, finger-like projection, is connected to the cecum. 2. The ascending colon: The ascending colon is the next section and moves upward on the right side of the abdomen. Its main function is to absorb fluids and salts (electrolytes) and transmit the remaining contents to the next part of the colon. 3. The transverse colon: As the name suggests, the transverse colon is the segment that extends horizontally from the right side of the abdomen to the left side. This portion of the colon continues the absorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining undigested food material. 4. The descending colon: The descending colon begins on the left side of the abdomen and moves downward. This section of the colon is responsible for storing the remaining waste before they are excreted out of the body. 5. The sigmoid colon: The sigmoid colon is the S-shaped section that connects the descending colon to the rectum. Its function is to hold the fecal matter until the body is ready for a bowel movement. 6. The rectum: Though not directly a part of the colon, it is vital in completing the functions of the large intestine. The rectum is a muscular chamber that receives the fecal matter from the sigmoid colon and expels it through the anus during defecation. In summary, the medical name for the large intestine in the human body is the colon. It consists of several sections, including the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and eventually connects to the rectum. The colon plays a crucial role in the digestive system by absorbing water, electrolytes, and vitamins, and eliminating waste products from the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Until one fateful day, his world is turned upside down when he hears a sound that would haunt him incessantly - the anxious cry of a child echoing from the bell tower of the town‚Äôs dilapidated church that has been locked up and abandoned for years. The child, named Eli, is an adventurous and curious six-year-old who has an affinity for exploring abandoned places and collecting relics. He sneaked into the bell tower out of curiosity but accidentally tripped on some loose rubble, causing a floor collapse. He is now trapped in the towering structure that has become a nightmarish maze. Daniel learns about the situation through Eli‚Äôs friends who saw him sneak into the church but were too scared to follow. He immediately springs into action, negotiating the disintegrating stairs and loose floors of the tower, calling out Eli's name and reassured by the responding echoes indicating the child's consciousness. Battling the odds not just from the hazardous conditions inside the bell tower but also the ticking clock, Daniel, with his firefighting equipment, breaks through barriers and navigates with precise judgment and unparalleled bravery. All the while, the town's people remain vigilant and supportive outside the bell tower, their hopes dwindling with each passing hour. With time running out, Daniel gets into a fix ‚Äì he has to traverse through a weakened floor that might give away under their combined weight. Making a tough choice, he decides to cross it alone, promising to return for Eli. Yet, as he crosses, the floor gives away despite his calculated efforts. Miraculously, he manages to hang on to the ropes of the bell tower which leads him to a safely reachable part of the floor below. Yet now Daniel is faced with a two-pronged dilemma ‚Äì to find a safe route back up to Eli, and to do it quickly as the bell tower walls start to crumble. He hatches an ingenious plan utilizing his fireman's gear and the thick bell ropes. After multiple trials and sweat-drenching efforts, an exhausted Daniel hoists himself back to Eli. Clinging to each other amidst the collapsing tower, they miraculously navigate their way down, guided by Eli's knowledge of his previous exploration. As they walk out of the tower, just as it finally crumbles to the ground, the townspeople cheer in relief and joy. Daniel becomes a celebrated hero in the town of Bedford, and young Eli learns a valuable lesson about safety. Most importantly, a resonant bond forms between the two of them ‚Äî one that encapsulates the spirit of humanity, resilience, and the strong bond shared in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They found some leftover pizza from a previous meeting, which they promptly offered as an alternative. Step 4: Gather feedback In order to understand if this issue affected employee satisfaction, the office manager spoke with a few employees to gather their opinions on the lunch mishap. This feedback would be valuable for future event planning and coordination. Step 5: Follow up with the catering company After gathering feedback, the office manager contacted the catering company once more to provide them with the input collected.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who refuses to write their autobiography as part of the interview process?  Ten years after the end of World War II, Tom Rath is living in suburban Connecticut with his wife Betsy and three children; he's having difficulty supporting his family on his salary writing for a nonprofit organization. Tom is also dealing with flashbacks from his combat service as an Army Captain in both the European and Pacific theaters, involving men that he killed (including, by accident, his best friend), and a young Italian girl named Maria, with whom he had a brief but heartfelt affair in Italy despite his being in a relationship with Betsy at the time. Before he left Maria for the final time to go back into battle, Tom was told that she was pregnant and was going to keep the baby. He would never see her or the child again. When an expected inheritance from Tom's recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted, leaving only her large and unsaleable mansion, Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher-paying job. Acting on a tip from a fellow train commuter, Tom applies for an opening in public relations at television network UBC. Asked to write his autobiography as part of the interview process, he refuses. Hired nonetheless, he helps network president Ralph Hopkins launch a national mental health campaign. Hopkins is powerful and highly respected, but unbeknownst to his employees, his workaholic habits have caused him to be estranged from his wife and his rebellious daughter, who soon elopes with an unsuitable man.

Step 2: Prioritize Areas of Improvement Based on your analysis, identify which subjects or assignments require immediate attention.

Step 3: Set SMART Goals When setting goals for improvement, ensure that they are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

Some examples of good study habits include: - Creating a consistent study schedule - Designating a quiet and organized study space - Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable sections - Using active learning techniques, such as summarizing information, asking questions, and teaching others - Taking regular breaks to prevent burnout - Reviewing class materials and notes regularly Step 5: Use the Notebook Approach In the notebook, use the columns you labeled as 'reason', 'what?', and 'improvement' to identify and address weaknesses in your academic performance. For each area of improvement, write down the reason for the poor performance (e.g., procrastination, lack of understanding), the specific topic or assignment that needs improvement, and the action steps you will take to address the issue. Step 6: Seek Additional Resources To further support your effort to improve your grades, seek additional resources and assistance. This might include: - Attending tutoring or study group sessions - Asking teachers for additional help or supplementary materials - Utilizing online resources, videos, or tutorials to solidify understanding - Partnering with a classmate for peer support and encouragement Step 7: Track Progress and Adjust Strategies Regularly track your progress towards your goals by monitoring your grades, assignments, and any feedback from your teachers. Use this information to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategies and make adjustments as needed to stay on track. Step 8: Practice Time Management Create a daily and weekly schedule to allocate your time effectively between various subjects, extracurricular activities, and leisure. Ensure you include time for completing assignments, studying, review sessions, as well as self-care and relaxation.

Die Zerschlagung der √§gyptischen, jordanischen und syrischen Armeen im Sechs-Tage-Krieg hat zwar die milit√§rische √úberlegenheit des Landes unterstrichen, aber auch tief sitzende politische und soziale Spannungen innerhalb der Region entfacht. Diese Spannungen sind auch heute noch Gegenstand von Debatten und Verhandlungen, in denen es um den Frieden und die Stabilit√§t im Nahen Osten geht. Daher sollte Israel trotz des erstaunlichen Sieges im Sechs-Tage-Krieg immer achtsam sein und weiterhin daran arbeiten, konstruktive Dialoge mit seinen Nachbarn aus Nahost zu f√ºhren. Nur so l√§sst sich eine langfristige Sicherheit und Stabilit√§t in der Region erreichen, die auf Verst√§ndigung und Zusammenarbeit beruht."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These \\"classical\\" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"Adare Manor, located in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland, is an exquisite example of the neo-gothic architectural style. It is a stunning manor house and hotel set amid lush landscapes. This unique structure was designed by the renowned architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham in the mid-19th century. Lewis Nockalls Cottingham (1787-1847) was a highly respected English architect, best known for his work in the Gothic Revival style. As one of the pioneers of historic architecture preservation, Cottingham was instrumental in restoring many medieval churches and buildings in England throughout his career. His skillful understanding of Gothic elements, as well as his passion for preserving architectural heritage, made him an ideal choice for designing Adare Manor. The manor was commissioned by the second Earl of Dunraven, Windham Henry Quin, who sought to create an exquisite Gothic Revival country house as a response to the burgeoning industrial development of that era. The Earl's ambition was to produce a stunning building that showcased the best of Gothic design while also reminding the world of Ireland's rich architectural heritage. Construction began on Adare Manor in the 1830s, and it took almost 30 years to complete, spanning the architectural careers of both Cottingham and his later successor, Philip Charles Hardwick. While the manor's master plan was conceived by Cottingham, he passed away before its completion, and Hardwick then took over, bringing his own touch to the project. Adare Manor incorporates several architectural styles, most prominently featuring Neo-Gothic, Tudor, and Elizabethan influences. The building's exterior demonstrates the harmonious use of local limestone, enhanced by pinnacles, turrets, and ornate sculpted ornamentation, predominantly featuring heraldic motifs. One of the most remarkable features of Adare Manor is the symmetrical design of the structure, which includes several repeating elements - an innovative concept for its time. Within the manor's interior, visitors can find spacious rooms with intricate woodcarvings, ornate plasterwork, and vast neo-gothic windows allowing an abundance of natural light to filter through. The neo-gothic, grey limestone structure sits on an 840-acre estate along the banks of the River Maigue. The estate boasts exquisite formal gardens, lush woodlands, and a championship golf course ‚Äì providing a tranquil contrast to the imposing manor house. The manor combines ancient aesthetics with modern luxuries, having been meticulously restored and reopened in 2017 as a five-star hotel, offering guests a one-of-a-kind experience in terms of accommodation, dining, and leisure. The adaptation of this historic building into a contemporary hotel required immense effort and careful consideration to preserve and restore the architectural heritage it represents. Yet, Adare Manor is a prime example of how it remains possible to breathe new life into these magnificent buildings without sacrificing their historical appeal. In summary, Adare Manor is a beautiful and elaborate neo-gothic manor house designed by the esteemed architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham. Its magnificent structure, with intricate details, symmetrical elements, and the seamless fusion of architectural styles, has made it a landmark in Irish heritage. As a luxurious hotel today, Adare Manor continues to preserve and showcase the extraordinary craftsmanship and dedication that defined the work of Cottingham and his successor, Hardwick."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A Dinner of My Doing My friend scrunched up her nose. ‚ÄúYou shot this?‚Äù she asked, referring to the two birds‚Äîor, rather, the breast meat from two birds‚Äîon the table in front of us on a recent night. ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI shot two birds, a pheasant and a partridge. But we can‚Äôt be sure the ones I shot are the actual ones we‚Äôre eating right now. These are definitely from that same hunt, though.‚Äù ‚ÄúI could never shoot a bird,‚Äù she said. No, she could only eat one. And it‚Äôs that kind of disconnect, so prevalent, that made me curious to have a hand for once in killing an animal I was prepared to ingest. If I‚Äôm fine‚Äîif we‚Äôre fine‚Äîwith someone else tackling that assignment in the service of our dinner, shouldn‚Äôt we be fine with tackling it ourselves? That was my thinking when I went hunting, for the first time, last week. I described that trip in a column, noting that hunters‚Äô rights and potential inconveniences are often mentioned by opponents to new restrictions on firearms. I figured that a brush with hunting, no matter how fleeting or limited or contrived, might give me at least a few new insights into that opposition, a few new questions about it. And it did. Some readers wrote to me to complain that my experience of hunting wasn‚Äôt a wholly representative one. They‚Äôre right. It was confined to birds, and it was done not in the wild per se, but on a preserve, or hunting grounds, where pheasants and partridges are raised‚Äîand then let loose‚Äîexpressly for hunters, or shooters, or whatever the right noun for those of us visiting preserves is. It‚Äôs hunting, of a sort, made convenient. Hunting lite. But such hunting isn‚Äôt uncommon at all. In Pennsylvania alone, as I noted in my column, there are more than 300 bird preserves. And to the extent that the birds in these preserves are raised only to be shot, well, the pork and beef and chicken that‚Äôs sold in supermarkets or served in restaurants come from animals that are raised only to be slaughtered, and usually from animals raised in much more confined circumstances than the birds on the preserve, which roam in large pens prior to their release. I visited the Pennsylvania preserve with the chef Seamus Mullen, whose restaurant Tertulia, which serves Spanish food in Greenwich Village, I adore. He had hunted many times before, and not only at preserves, and he offered to be my tutor and guide. Before we turned our attention to the actual birds, he had me shoot clay pigeons, for practice, because I‚Äôd never previously fired a shotgun. Or a handgun. Or a rifle. Or anything other than the kind of weapon you use in a game like laser tag, which I‚Äôve played with nieces and nephews. He schooled me in gun safety. And only after that did the three of us‚ÄîSeamus and I and a friend of his named Ernie Sabine, who is the designer and owner of the New York menswear and men‚Äôs accessory label Ernest Alexander‚Äîgrab the preserve‚Äôs Brittany spaniel, which would find and flush out the birds for us, and spread out through the fields and forests of the preserve. Between us we shot 17 birds in all. I definitely shot one of them, a chukar partridge, or chukar, and probably shot another, a pheasant, though there was some confusion about who had hit that particular bird. And that elicited a strange brew of feelings. There was a bit of an adrenaline rush. Some nervousness. Some anxiety. Some squeamishness. Even some sorrow, for lack of a better word. And overarching all of this was indeed a sense that there was something honest about what I was doing, to the extent that I was taking ownership, if only partly and briefly, of how my food came to me and where it was coming from. I emphasize partly. Seamus gutted the birds. Seamus plucked and cleaned them. And he cooked them, for a dinner two nights later, to which I brought three companions. For the gastronomes out there, here‚Äôs a bit more detail about how Seamus cooked the chukar and the pheasant that we ate: He deboned the legs, ground the flesh and seasoned it with pimenton, garlic and other herbs. The ground meat was used in a paella-style rice made with brown chicken stock and with a jus that incorporated the birds‚Äô innards. The breast meat of the birds was left on the bone, browned in duck fat, and then smoked over oak wood on a grill before being carved and served, in petal-shaped pieces, over the rice. On the side was a sauce made with the jus and with butter, sherry, several kinds of pepper and braised mushrooms, among other ingredients. On top of the rice Seamus put not only the breast meat but also a few pheasant eggs poached in duck fat. It was a great-looking dish, and if I were more adept with my iPhone‚Äôs camera, and hadn‚Äôt been taking the pictures of the meal in such a dark room, you‚Äôd see that. But I recounted Seamus‚Äôs construction of the dish not just as an exercise in food porn but as a bridge to the following observation: by the time the dish appeared in front of me, so much had happened‚Äîso much that I‚Äôd had no hand in‚Äîthat I felt nearly as disconnected from it as if the meat had been bought from a butcher. I didn‚Äôt look at it or take a bite and think, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my quarry. That‚Äôs my doing.‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs delicious, and apparently has something to do with my hunt the other day.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt taste better, worse, more or less immediate. It just tasted like dinner. With one difference. As I chewed one bit, one of my teeth clamped down on something small and hard: a bit of bird shot, apparently.

Former police officer Ian Langford, pictured with his new wife outside court today, slept with two women he met after attending incidents at their home. A police officer who seduced and slept with vulnerable women while on duty has been jailed for 18 months today. Ian Langford, 46, who served with West Mercia Police in Shropshire, struck up relationships with two women after being called to attend incidents at their homes. Langford would visit the women, who he was having relationships with at the same time, during his shifts, Gloucester Crown Court heard. The father-of-one‚Äôs police radio was heard to go off during visits and he even called a police car to bring him back to the station, the court was told. Langford‚Äôs 'totally unacceptable' actions led to a trial collapsing in court - as he was sleeping with the key prosecution witness. He also illegally accessed police records to gain the contact details of one of his victims when she changed her phone number after their relationship ended. The court was also told how Langford was docked 13 days pay in 2008 by West Mercia Police for sleeping with a. vulnerable women after attending her home following a domestic violence. incident. Langford, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, who was supported by his new wife in court today, admitted two charges of misconduct in a public office for the relationships, which took place in 2012 and 2013. The judge sentenced Langford to nine. months for each count of misconduct in a public office, to run. consecutively - meaning a prison term of 18 months. He also made an order banning the identification of any of Langford‚Äôs victims. Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Langford that his actions had brought the police service into disrepute. 'You are not a man of good character because in 2008 you were reprimanded for committing a similar, if not identical, offence with another vulnerable woman,' the judge said. 'If you needed reminding that such behaviour was totally unacceptable, that incident should have deterred you. 'However, in May 2012, you met up with one victim. She was the victim of domestic violence, as had been the victim in 2008. 'She was looking for the protection of the law and the understanding of the police. You chose to seduce her when she was at her most vulnerable. 'Later, when the affair had come to an end you misused police data to discover her private phone number.' Prosecuting, Janine Wood said Langford. met his first victim in May 2012, after being called to her home to. attend a domestic violence incident. Langford 'immediately' began complimenting the woman and later contacted her on Facebook. The former officer, who served with West Merica police, would visit the women - who he was seeing at the same time - while on duty. He also called a police car to come and collect him following a meeting. 'She was vulnerable having suffered. years of abuse from her partner, Mr Langford gave her compliments and. support,' Ms Wood said. 'A sexual relationship began very soon afterwards.' The relationship ended a few months later and the woman changed her phone number. 'In December 2012, the command and control logs were accessed by Mr Langford and he obtained her phone number,' Ms Wood said. 'He sent her a text message minutes later.' In a victim impact statement, the woman said: 'As painful as it is to look back, when I think of the mental state I was in at the time I feel sick at how the authority figure in our community took advantage of me when he should have protected me.' The court heard how Langford met with a. second victim in June 2012 following a neighbourly dispute at her home -. which resulted in a trial. This meeting was while he was in a relationship with the first woman, the court heard. Ms Wood continued: 'He then began complimenting her inappropriately and gave her his email address and told her it was the address his wife didn‚Äôt know about,' Ms Wood said. 'He asked if he could kiss her and the relationship progressed. On a number of occasions she wrote in her journal and she recorded when sexual activity took place. 'That corresponded with Mr Langford‚Äôs GPRS tracker on his police radio. It was while he was on duty. 'There are exchanges of text messages which talk about what happened between them and mention him having to get a police car back to the station, confirming he was on duty at the time.' The relationship ended in June 2013, when the woman discovered Langford was engaged to be married to another woman, Ms Wood said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: 'I thought I was safe with him but he left me with an enduring belief that the old stereotype of dodgy policemen is still very much alive and kicking, especially when it comes to vulnerable women. 'My feelings are unsurprisingly more emotional, I feel rejected - why did he do this? For kicks or thrills while supposedly on police duty?' The court heard how the man had previous relations with a domestic violence victim in 2008. Judge Jamie Tabor added: 'The. case was compromised when it came to trial because the defendant let it. be known that you were having an affair with the prosecution witness. 'As a. result, the case had to be dropped, although a restraining order was. imposed. Nothing could demonstrate better why police officers have to. conduct themselves in a exemplary manner. 'Both. your victims feel extremely let down by the police. You targeted women. when they were at their most vulnerable. You carried out the affairs. while actually on duty. 'Your behaviour has brought the police service into disrepute.' Representing Langford, Simon Hunka said his client had joined the police force in 1989. He said Langford had previously been married but wed his new wife following the end of his relationship with the second victim in June last year. The relationship with his first victim ended in August 2012, when she went on holiday with her children, Mr Hunka explained. 'He is someone who has shown deep remorse and shame for his behaviour, he doesn‚Äôt try to excuse it,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is not someone who has set out with a specific sinister agenda.' Mr Hunka said his client, father to his 11-year-old daughter, no longer works for the police force. 'This is someone who had a long standing is the community,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is from a respected and respectful family and he knows he has brought shame on to that.'","output":"A police officer named Ian Langford did some very wrong things while he was on duty. He met two women when helping them during emergencies and later started relationships with them. He visited these women when he was supposed to be working. This was very bad because he was not doing his job properly and was not treating these women nicely. The judge decided that Ian Langford should go to jail for 18 months as punishment for his actions. The judge also said that this case shows why police officers should always behave well and do their job properly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Our family was going to go fishing on Saturday. A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond. Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion.  Which pond will the family most likely catch more fish, Ridge Pond or Happy Pond?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is more likely that the family will catch more fish at Ridge Pond than at Happy Pond. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion: 1. Fertilizer runoff: As mentioned, rain can dissolve fertilizer in the soil and carry it away, ending up in bodies of water. Being situated down the hill from a mushroom farm, Happy Pond is more susceptible to this runoff, increasing the nitrogen levels in the water. 2. Algae growth: With increased nitrogen levels, algae can grow out of control in bodies of water, such as what has been observed with the green coating across the top of Happy Pond. This excessive algae growth can have several negative consequences for the overall health of the pond and its inhabitants. 3. Oxygen depletion: Algae consume a significant amount of oxygen in the water, which may result in decreased levels of oxygen available for other aquatic life, such as fish. Additionally, once the algae die, the decomposers breaking down the dead tissue also consume oxygen, further depleting the available oxygen in the water. 4. Dead zone formation: When oxygen levels get too low, a dead zone can form ‚Äì an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. This greatly reduces the chances of catching fish in that area. Happy Pond's green coating and history of nutrient runoff suggest that it may be approaching or is already within the dead zone territory. On the other hand, Ridge Pond, located in the center of the park, has not been reported to have issues with excessive algae growth or oxygen depletion. As a result, it is more likely to have a healthier aquatic ecosystem, which would support a greater number of fish for the family to catch. In conclusion, considering the factors of fertilizer runoff, algae growth, oxygen depletion, and potential dead zone formation, Ridge Pond would be the more suitable choice for the family to catch more fish for their family reunion. Happy Pond's current condition makes it less likely to support a thriving fish population, and therefore, the family is advised to opt for Ridge Pond instead."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Tracy?\\", is \\"an average employee\\" a valid answer? Possible answers:  (a). Yes.  (b). No. Answer:","output":"(b). No. A detailed explanation for this answer is as follows: Describing Tracy as an \\"average employee\\" based solely on the information provided in the given scenario is not a valid answer. The information presented reveals that Tracy was able to perform her job function successfully, which eventually led to a raise from their employer. This indicates that Tracy was not just an average performer, but rather someone who effectively completed tasks and had a positive impact on their employer's evaluation of their work. When assessing an employee, various factors and criteria are considered to determine their overall performance and value within an organization. Some factors to consider include work ethic, teamwork, adaptability, communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and leadership potential. Simply labeling an employee as \\"average\\" without considering these additional factors can be misleading and insufficient in painting a comprehensive picture of their capabilities and contributions. It is essential to acknowledge that the term \\"average\\" carries a different connotation across industries and workspaces. Generally, an average employee is someone who meets minimum expectations set by their employer or someone whose performance is neither outstanding nor below standard. However, with the limited information provided, it is challenging to determine Tracy's performance relative to her colleagues or how she compares with the typical employee in her company or industry. Therefore, based on the available information, it is not recommended to describe Tracy as an \\"average employee.\\" Doing so could be a disservice to her and doesn't reflect the fact that her efforts led to a raise. Instead, it would be more accurate to describe Tracy as an employee who performed her job functions effectively, maintained a strong work ethic, demonstrated potential, and ultimately earned a well-deserved raise from her employer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It means getting new school bags and books, and seeing friends again after the summer holiday. My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items  are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30. I found all the things I needed for my sons and even bought something for myself. I spent about 50 on each of them, including school uniforms. At the end of the day, we returned to our home carrying many shopping bags filled with items that made my children happy and excited to go back to school.

Answer based on context: The Konbaung-Hanthawaddy war was the last of the many wars fought between the Burmese-speaking north and the Mon-speaking south that began with King Anawrahta's conquest of the south in 1057. Many more wars had been fought over the centuries. Aside from the Forty Years' War in the 14th and 15th centuries, the south usually had been on the losing side. But this war proved to be the proverbial final nail. For the Mon, the defeat marked the end of their dream of independence. For a long time, they would remember the utter devastation that accompanied the final collapse of their short-lived kingdom. Thousands fled across the border into Siam. One Mon monk wrote of the time: \\"Sons could not find their mothers, nor mothers their sons, and there was weeping throughout the land\\". Soon, entire communities of ethnic Burmans from the north began to settle in the delta. Mon rebellions still flared up in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. Each revolt typically was followed by fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions. The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774. In the aftermath of revolts, Burmese language was encouraged at the expense of Mon. Chronicles by late 18th century and early 19th Mon monks portrayed the south's recent history as a tale of unrelenting northern encroachment. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Centuries of Mon supremacy along the coast came to an end.

George McGovern rode the swirling social and political currents of America in the late 1960s and early 1970s to lead a political movement that permanently changed the nation in ways that we still do not fully understand. A mild-mannered Midwestern intellectual, World War II combat hero and son of a Methodist minister, he became the leading edge of a storm promising (or threatening, depending on your point of view) transformative change on a wide range of issues including foreign policy, the electoral process and the rights of women. It was a storm that gathered intense support and equally intense opposition in the senator's run for president against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. While the nation's younger and more highly educated rallied to McGovern's standard, the \\"silent majority\\" were deeply troubled by much of what they believed to be the McGovern agenda. George McGovern, an unabashed liberal voice, dies. Ultimately, much of what George McGovern campaigned for in 1972 came to pass. Both major political parties have a system of nominating a president that is far more transparent, accountable and democratic than the systems that existed prior to 1972. McGovern was instrumental in rewriting the rules for selecting Democratic convention delegates to include women, minorities and young people. (Women, minorities and gays now have far more rights and protections than they did in 1972.) But the cutting edge of the 1972 campaign was about how America dealt with the rest of the world, how it chose and challenged its adversaries, and in particular, how it would resolve the Vietnam War. By gaining the Democratic nomination, McGovern became the leading opponent of the war; he challenged the usefulness of the 25-year strategy of containing the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and any other nation committed to or influenced by Communism. McGovern and many other political leaders in both parties argued that in opposing Communism or other types of totalitarianism, the U.S. had to be far more strategic -- that fighting in places like Vietnam, where the outcome would have little real consequence on our nation's global struggle against a failed ideology, squandered American lives and treasure. Greene: McGovern a strong man who overcame defeat. While the Nixon administration and conservative Republicans lambasted McGovern for those views, Nixon eventually signed a peace agreement that ended the war on terms no more favorable than would have been granted had the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment been adopted in 1970 -- an amendment that proposed a complete withdrawal of troops from Vietnam and would have saved thousands of American combat casualties. Here is part of the passionate speech -- bracingly relevant today -- that McGovern delivered on the Senate floor before the vote defeating the amendment:. \\"Every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. This chamber reeks of blood. Every senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval and all across our land √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù young men without legs, or arms, or genitals, or faces or hopes. \\"There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed. But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes. And if we do not end this damnable war, those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the executive carry the burden that the Constitution places on us. \\"So before we vote, let us ponder the admonition of Edmund Burke, the great parliamentarian of an earlier day: 'A contentious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood.'\\" Highlights of George McGovern's life. Today, American businesses are seeking to broaden our commercial relationships with Vietnam, and American military advisers meet with the Vietnamese to suggest strategies that will help that country protect the territory it claims in the South China Sea from possible Chinese aggression. George McGovern never fully recovered from the drubbing he received at the polls in November of 1972. But the path that he pointed to was ultimately the path the country took, and the movement he founded drew thousands of men and women, who committed their lives to public service and who continue to contribute to their communities and their country 40 years later. George McGovern was never the extremist his opponents tried to characterize him as being. His subsequent electoral success in South Dakota was evidence enough of that fact. But he was a man of great vision and grace. He helped to educate a generation about the failures of a rigid and untextured accounting of our allies and our enemies, and about the importance of making smart choices when dealing with dangerous adversaries. Those are lessons as important today as they were in 1970. Politicians pay tribute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Lilly. Write highlights for this article.","output":"George McGovern, a prominent American politician, World War II combat hero, and intellectual, has passed away. As an influential figure in American politics, he significantly impacted the nation in various aspects, including foreign policy, electoral processes, and the rights of women. During his 1972 presidential campaign against Richard Nixon, he advocated for the end of the Vietnam War and the adaption of a more strategic approach in fighting against communism. Despite losing in 1972, he continued championing more democratic systems and has since been regarded as a man of great vision and grace, teaching a generation the importance of making smart choices when dealing with adversaries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

The duke's son William, who succeeded his father in 1785, was a man of weak intellect, and his cousin Peter, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of L√ºbeck, acted as regent and eventually, in 1823, inherited the throne, holding the Prince-Bishopric of L√ºbeck and Oldenburg in personal union.

He retired from professional cycling in September 2009 to take up a non-racing role with the team .  - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams¬† relabelled UCI ProTeams¬† will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races.  - The UCI Road World Cup was a season-long road bicycle racing competition comprising ten one-day events. The competition was inaugurated in 1989, and replaced the Super Prestige Pernod International. In the first three years, the competition was sponsored by Perrier. The competition determined a winning individual, and a winning team  - A cycling team is a group of cyclists who join a team or are acquired and train together to compete in bicycle races whether amateur or professional  and the supporting personnel. Cycling teams are most important in road bicycle racing, which is a team sport, but collaboration between team members is also important in track cycling and cyclo-cross.  - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour. It refers to both the tour of 28 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these.

He trained his army strictly until it was very strong. Three years later, he led his army against the State of Yue and caught its king Gou Jian, who was taken to the State of Wu. Gou Jian was put into a small black stone house which was full of terrible smell and was made to raise  horses. Gou worked hard and tried to keep himself quiet, but he never forgot his pain. Many years later, he was set free. Gou secretly trained his army after he went back to his own state. In order to make himself strong-minded he slept on firewood and ate a gall bladder before having dinner and going to bed every night. After a few years, his country became strong once more. Then Gou took hold of a golden chance to fight against Wu and won the war in the end. If one voluntarily  works very hard and voluntarily stands up to pains and difficulties in order to succeed, we might call him a\\"Gou Jian\\", and his story, a\\"Gou Jian's story\\". Question: Three years later   _   was caught and taken to the state of Wu.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - Aslanbek Soltanovich Bulatsev (; born in 1963 in Mikhaylovskoye, Prigorodny District, North Ossetian ASSR, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union) is an Ossetian politician and official. Bulatsev formerly worked as a tax chief in the Russian region of North Ossetia. On October 22, 2008, he was appointed Prime Minister of the Republic of South Ossetia by the South Ossetian parliament. Bulatsev was fired, according to the official decree, on health reasons, on 4 August 2009. He was replaced by Vadim Brovtsev, the head of a Russian construction company.  - Senatus consultum ultimum (\\"\\"Final decree of the Senate\\"\\" or Final Act, often abbreviated SCU), more properly senatus consultum de re publica defendenda (\\"\\"Decree of the Senate about defending the Republic\\"\\") is the modern term (based on Caesar's wording at \\"Bell. Civ.\\" 1.5) given to a decree of the Roman Senate during the late Roman Republic passed in times of emergency. The form was usually \\"consules darent operam ne quid detrimenti res publica caperet\\" or \\"videant consules ne res publica detrimenti capiat\\" (\\"let the consuls see to it that the state suffer no harm\\"). It was first officially decreed prior to the fall of Gaius Gracchus in 121 BC, and subsequently at several other points, including during Lepidus' march on Rome in 77 BC, the Conspiracy of Catiline in 63 BC, and before Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC. The \\"senatus consultum ultimum\\" effectively replaced the disused dictatorship, by removing limitations on the magistrates' powers to preserve the State. After the rise of the Principate, there was little need for the Senate to issue the decree again.  - South Ossetia, also known as the Tskhinvali Region, is a partially recognised state in the South Caucasus, located in the territory of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the former Georgian SSR. Its population of 53,000 lives in an area of 3,900 km, south of the Russian Caucasus, with 30,000 living in its capital city of Tskhinvali.  - An emergency is a situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment. Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.  - Boris Eliozovich Chochiev ( Russian :    ; Ossetian :     ; born 1 November 1957 in Styrkom , Tskhinvali district , South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast , Georgian SSR , Soviet Union ) is a former acting Prime Minister of South Ossetia . He became Prime Minister on 18 August 2008 , after South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity had dismissed the former government and proclaimed a state of emergency . On 22 October 2008 , the South Ossetian parliament appointed Aslanbek Bulatsev as new Prime Minister . Before becoming Prime Minister , Chochiev served as first deputy minister , as well chief negotiator for the South Ossetian secessionist government . Chochiev was also a member of the Joint Control Commission .  - A government or division of government (i.e. on a municipal, provincial/state level) may declare that their area is in a state of emergency. This means that the government can suspend and/or change some functions of the executive, the legislative and/or the judiciary during this period of time. It alerts citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. A government can declare a state of emergency during a time of natural or human-made disaster, during a period of civil unrest, or following a declaration of war or situation of international/internal armed conflict. \\"Justitium\\" is its equivalent in Roman law, where Senate could put forward senatus consultum ultimum.  - Ossetia (Ossetic: ,  \\"Ir\\", \\"Iryston\\"; Russian: , \\"Osetiya\\"; Georgian: , \\"Oset'i\\") is an ethnolinguistic region located on both sides of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, largely inhabited by the Ossetians. The Ossetian language is part of the Eastern Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages family. The Ossetian-speaking area south of the main Caucasus ridge is recognized by most countries as within the borders of Georgia, but under the control of the Russian-backed \\"de facto\\" government of the Republic of South Ossetia. The northern portion of the region consists of the republic of North OssetiaAlania within the Russian Federation.  - The Supreme Soviet (\\"Verkh√≥vnyj Sov√©t\\") was the common name for the legislative bodies (parliaments) of the Soviet socialist republics (SSR) in the Soviet Union. These soviets were modeled after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, established in 1938, and were nearly identical. Soviet-approved delegates to the Supreme Soviets were periodically elected in unopposed elections. The first free or semi-free elections were held during the \\"perestroika\\" in late 1980s. The soviets were largely rubber stamp institutions, approving decisions handed to them by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or of each SSR. The soviets met infrequently (often only twice a year for only several days) and elected the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a permanent body, to act on their behalf while the soviet was not in session. Under the 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet served as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviets also elected the Council of Ministers, an executive body. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December, 1991, most of these soviets became the legislatures of independent countries.  - The South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast (, Ossetian:    ) was an autonomous oblast of the Soviet Union created within the Georgian SSR on April 20, 1922. Its autonomy was revoked on December 10, 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR, leading to the First South Ossetian War. Currently, its territory is controlled by the breakaway Republic of South Ossetia.  - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.  - Tskhinvali (; ) is the capital of South Ossetia, a disputed region in Georgia. It has been recognised as an independent Republic by Russia and three other UN members. South Ossetia is a de facto independent state that controls its claimed territory, in part with the support of Russian troops. Despite this, it is recognised by all other UN members as part of Georgia.

Provide a detailed answer so user don‚Äôt need to search outside to understand the answer. Teacher:Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

We don't need a specific action for this yet, as the sequence will naturally follow. 3. \\"turn opposite left\\": The agent needs to turn in the opposite direction of left. Since left is the direction, turning in the opposite direction will require a right turn.    - I_TURN_RIGHT The correct sequence of actions to execute the command \\"run right thrice and turn opposite left\\" is: I_RUN, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Zimmerman says he's sorry Trayvon Martin's family had to bury their child; family calls apology insincere George Zimmerman, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News' Sean Hannity, called the shooting death of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin a \\"tragic situation\\" and \\"the most difficult thing I'll ever go through in my life.\\" The volunteer neighborhood watch leader spoke about details of the shooting, said he's sorry that Martin‚Äôs mother and father had to bury their child and, when asked if he regrets anything that happened that February night, he said, \\"No.\\" \\"I feel that it was all God's plan, and for me to second guess it or judge it,\\" Zimmerman shook his head. Martin's mother and father watched the interview and appeared on \\"Fox & Friends\\" Thursday morning. His mother and father both said Zimmerman's apology appeared insincere and were troubled that the man accused of killing their son considered it all \\"God‚Äôs plan.\\" \\"I don't understand what he was thinking by saying it was God's plan that he murdered our child,\\" Tracy Martin, the teen‚Äôs father said. \\"I really don‚Äôt understand what God he worships because it‚Äôs not the same God that I worship.\\" Sabrina Fulton, Martin‚Äôs mother, also appeared angered by the comment. \\"Why would God have him kill an unarmed teenager?\\" she asked. \\"It makes no sense.\\" During the interview with Hannity, Zimmerman said he followed Martin because he looked suspicious running between houses in the rain. Martin turned to confront Zimmerman and \\"asked me what my problem was\\" before the exchange escalated into violence, Zimmerman told Hannity in his first TV interview, conducted in an undisclosed location in Florida. The 28-year-old, with his attorney sitting by his side, said he reached into his pocket to find his phone to call 911 for a second time, and \\"I looked up and he punched me and broke my nose.\\" At one point Zimmerman said he heard Martin \\"telling me he‚Äôs going to kill me.\\" Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder for shooting and killing 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., though he says he acted in self-defense. At first, \\"I didn't think I hit him,\\" Zimmerman said, adding he only found out later that Martin had died. Now he is in hiding and said he feels his life is in jeopardy, based on death threats he has received. He told Fox News that on the night of the shooting he had gone out to shop at Target -- \\"that's the last time I've been home.\\" The case drew intense national attention as speculation grew about the motives for the shooting, especially given that Martin was black. Zimmerman has white and Hispanic heritage. He dismissed suggestions by some that he acted out of racism. \\"I don't think it's fair that they rushed to judgment to assume that,\\" he told Fox News. Police initially declined to press charges, citing Florida's so-called \\"Stand Your Ground\\" law. But a special prosecutor who was called in to investigate concluded that the evidence didn't support Zimmerman's claims, and the murder charge was filed. When asked what he would say to Martin's parents, Zimmerman said, \\"I would tell them that, again, I'm sorry.\\" \\"My wife and I don‚Äôt have any children,\\" Zimmerman told Hannity. \\"I have nephews that I love more than life. I love them more than myself. And I know when they were born, it was a different unique bond and love that I have with them. And I love my children even though that they aren‚Äôt born yet. \\"I am sorry that they buried their child. I can‚Äôt imagine what it must feel like. I pray for them daily.\\" Zimmerman, who is free on bond in Florida while awaiting trial, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Hannity had spoke with Zimmerman, 28, off the record in April when he contacted Hannity against the advice of his attorneys. Both Hannity and Zimmerman denied claims that Hannity offered the murder suspect any financial assistance or payment. The interview concluded with Zimmerman looking into the camera and saying that he wishes the night hadn't ended in Martin's death. \\"I do want to tell everyone, my wife, my family, my parents, my grandmother, the Martins, the city of Sanford and America that I'm sorry that this happened,\\" he said. \\"I hate to think that because of this incident, because my actions, it's polarized and divided American. And I'm truly sorry.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a man named George Zimmerman who was involved in a situation where he shot a teenager named Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman says he is sorry that Trayvon's parents had to bury their child, but Trayvon's parents think his apology is not genuine. Zimmerman believes what happened was part of God's plan, which Trayvon's parents do not agree with. Zimmerman is being charged with second-degree murder, which means he is being accused of causing someone's death on purpose.

John (Scott Adkins) seems to wake up from a coma, after 9 months - or so he is told - still freshly remembering how a guy named Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) brutally killed his family. The truth however is that this John is a new clone, with implanted memories of a non-existent family. Obviously, also the killing did never happen. An FBI agent (Rus Blackwell) has some \\"questions\\" for John as soon as he wakes up, showing him a photo of the killer and providing John with a name. The objective of this all is to make John think he has free will and make him want to hunt down and kill Deveraux. Deveraux is wanted badly by the government because he's running an underground organisation that frees clones like John from the government and gives them the truth and gives them back their free will by removing any false memories they might have. When John goes out exploring he meets people that he never saw before (obviously, he was just born) but who seem to recognize him. At this point we don't know much of the background story yet, so it's a real mystery when we learn on a few occasions that John apparently can be very violent. First we hear from his ex-girl friend that he once beat a man half-to-death in front of the club where she works (which is why he isn't welcome anymore there), then we meet a guy in some storage building who looks awfully deformed with scares, which apparently is the work of John and reveals that John killed a good friend of himself! At last John finds his former clone, and things become more clear: the previous John had been sent on the same mission - albeit without the false memories about having a family. This John has been freed by Deveraux and worked for him for a while, until he felt he was now the slave of Deveraux instead of the government and left him. Meanwhile Deveraux and his recruits are also hunting John, thinking he is the traitor who left them. After our John kills Magnus, the guy that is hunting him (Andrei Arlovski), finds the first John and kills him (because he attacked the girl, not sure why myself), things change. He lets himself get captured by Deveraux's men and is finally revealed the real truth. They offer him to remove his false memories which at first he agrees to. However, when he is at the verge of losing the memories of his wife and daughter, he freaks out and goes on a killing spree instead, holding on to his memories as real. So, in the end, the government seems to succeed in their plan that making it a personal matter for their clone was the key to get through to Deveraux. What they did not foresee however is that John also holds the government responsible for his pain, whether or not Deveraux killed his family or not: if he did then the government set him up to it in order to make him want to kill Deveraux. It's the same to John. After Deveraux let himself be killed, John is now the respected leader of the other universal soldiers. The story gets in a stream acceleration in the end, because apparently they went and got the last container that had to be sent \\"upstream\\" which contained the last equipment needed to clone people. When John meets with the FBI agent again he is not alone. The agent boosts about his achievement (by giving John false memories) but John kills him... and replaces the agent with a clone. From there we can guess what kind of fight is going to follow, but I suppose that will indeed be part of a future movie.

In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity  that could be carried, or stolen. Therefore, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to make sure of the fact, however, untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building' s design made it appear strong, the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol showed the general attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Except pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a tangible commodity has largely been replaced by credit. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable factor is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank.

I was not the only one who sent my dish back untouched. the foie gras topping  was good, but not enough to help make the beef edible. We didnt even have the option to comment or send it back.The Table should be imbarrassed and ashamed!!!!!Fourth course-cheese plate,minimal but enjoyable.Fifth-Dessert was a home run. Blueberry buckle and flan over duck egg pavlova (like meringue ) and a side of extra mini treats.Wine pairings were enjoyable.atmosphere was fantasticCustomer service-SUCKED!! I watched them clear FOUR Waygu beef plates that were UNTOUCHED because they were SO OVERCOOKED and not edible.NOT ONE CHEF/ SERVER ASKED OR APOLOGIZED FIR THE DISGUSTING BEEF!!!When a chef sees numerous plates of UNEATEN food returned to kitchen and doesnt find out why... They clearly DO NOT CARE!!!They are 'trained chefs' and plated  over cooked fish and beef and served it to us!!INSULTING! DISGUSTING!OBNOXIOUS!!TAKE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!! THE TABLE does NOT deserve patrons with the overcooked food they intentionally served us...Not to mention when we finally commented on the over cooked beef, they could have cared less.I am so disappointed because I like to support local restaraunts ,especially who use local products. BUT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING The Table!!!!SIDENOTE- I went with friends who were repeat customers and said their first experience was AMAZING! However the experience this time was disappointing to our friends as well! A restaraunt  that isnt consistent at that level of 'cooking/dining' experience is NOT acceptable. Especially since the owners/chefs could care less that they served their paying guests OVERCOOKED meat and fish!!! No excuse!!!! A:","output":"negative To come up with the answer, I carefully read through the provided review and analyzed the content. The reviewer mentioned several negative aspects, such as overcooked food, poor customer service, and a lack of consistency in the restaurant's quality. They used words like \\"disappointed,\\" \\"disgusting,\\" \\"insulting,\\" and \\"obnoxious,\\" which are all negative in tone. There were a few positive comments about the atmosphere, wine pairings, and a couple of dishes, but the overall tone and majority of the content focused on the negative aspects of the experience.

Answer this question: what would need to happen to change a lead atom into a gold atom??","output":"Alright, imagine you have a toy box full of different types of building blocks. Now, a lead block (lead atom) is different from a gold block (gold atom) because they have different numbers of small pieces (called protons) inside them. To change a lead block into a gold block, we need to add or remove some of these small pieces. Scientists could try to make this change using a special process called nuclear reactions, where they change the number of protons inside the lead block. But, doing this is very difficult and expensive, like trying to change all the red Legos in a huge castle into blue ones. So, changing a lead atom into a gold atom is a bit like changing the building blocks of a toy. It can be done, but it's very, very hard, and not something we can easily do."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They say patience is a virtue   seldom found in women and never in men. This may or may not be true, but it's fair to say that there is nobody on the earth who couldn't benefit from more patience. Patience is necessary for success. It is said that \\"all good things come to those who wait\\". Many of the great scientists have remarked that their scientific discoveries came only through patient perseverance  . Edison said, \\"Genius was 99% perspiration and only 1% inspiration.\\" Patience teaches us to value the effort and not just the success. It is a mistake to think that happiness can only be obtained through achievements. Patience brings peace of mind. When we desire certain outcomes  , we'll have no peace of mind. Even if one desire is filled, the nature of desire is that more will appear in its place. There is no end to human desires. Patience means we will work with an attitude of detachment  . Patience can transform suffering into joy. Throughout life we suffer injustice; the best healer is patience. Through being patient and accepting our situation, it's quite possible for our suffering to be transformed. Sri Chinmoy said, \\"If failure has the strength to turn your life into bitterness itself, then patience has the strength to turn your life into the sweetest joy.\\" In the writer's opinion,   _   . A) human desires will easily be filled B) patience is a virtue seldom found in a person C) happiness can only be obtained through success D) patience is the best medicine of suffering Answer:","output":"D) patience is the best medicine of suffering"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options are: 1). negative 2). positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? 's plenty to enjoy","output":"The given phrase, \\"s plenty to enjoy,\\" can be considered positive. To better understand the reasoning behind this classification, let's first break down the phrase and analyze its components. 1. 's: This is a contraction of the verb \\"is,\\" which implies a state or condition. 2. plenty: This word denotes an ample amount, suggesting that there is more than enough of something. 3. to enjoy: This phrase indicates an opportunity for deriving pleasure or satisfaction from something. In context, \\"s plenty to enjoy\\" means that there is an abundance of enjoyable aspects or elements to be found in a particular situation or thing. This statement reflects a positive outlook, as it highlights many reasons for taking pleasure in whatever is being described. Now, let's see how this phrase would function in a sentence: \\"Despite the challenges faced, there's plenty to enjoy in a new city.\\" In this example, the phrase serves as a positive counterpoint to the mention of challenges, emphasizing that there are still numerous enjoyable aspects to be found in the new city. Overall, the phrase \\"s plenty to enjoy\\" carries a positive connotation, as it emphasizes an abundance of things to appreciate, value, or derive satisfaction from."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: Lance was a hothead, but he was getting better.  He removed himself from the situation and spent some time cooling off.  He didn't need what? Options: - expansion - relaxation - soap - revenge - loss of heat  Explain why a human would choose \\"revenge\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"revenge\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Contextual understanding: The context of the question involves Lance's emotional state and behavior, specifically about him being a hothead and trying to improve. In this context, \\"revenge\\" is the option that is most directly related to emotions and behaviors. 2. Eliminating irrelevant options: Each of the other provided options can be considered irrelevant or less relevant to the core issue at hand, which centers around Lance's emotional state and actions as a hothead.    a. Expansion: This term is likely unrelated to the context, as it is more likely to refer to growth or enlargement of a non-emotional concept, such as a business or object.        b. Relaxation: While relaxation may contribute to Lance's ability to cool off, the question implies that he already removed himself from the situation and spent time cooling off. Thus, relaxation isn't directly connected to what he didn't need.        c. Soap: This option seems irrelevant, as it is a physical object typically used for cleaning and has no direct connection to Lance's emotional state or actions.        d. Loss of heat: This term could be interpreted literally (as in losing physical heat), making it irrelevant to the context, or metaphorically (as in not being upset anymore). However, since Lance has already taken actions to cool off, the loss of heat isn't directly relevant to what he didn't need in this case. 3. Understanding human emotions: Humans typically choose revenge as a response to negative emotions such as anger or perceived injustice. In the context of Lance's situation, the fact that he was a hothead and removed himself from the situation to cool off implies that revenge is the most suitable option he didn't need to improve his emotional state or control his hotheaded tendencies. 4. Relating to the process of improvement: The question highlights Lance's efforts to improve by removing himself from the situation and cooling off. Choosing revenge as something he didn't need emphasizes his progress and implies that he is making an effort to move away from destructive behaviors like seeking revenge on others."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Florida millionaire on trial for wife's death But prosecutors painted a very different picture, casting doubt on Ward's unruffled demeanor and what they characterized as his ever-changing story of what happened. \\"This case is about the fact that it was Bob Ward that shot her almost dead between the eyes,\\" said Assistant State Attorney Robin Wilkinson in her opening statement. She brought up the 911 call, placed at 7:50 p.m. that night, in which Ward called and flatly said, \\"I just shot my wife.\\" But later in the call, according to Wilkinson, he started to change his story: \\"It becomes an accident and he doesn't know what happened ... Diane just ended up on the floor.\\" According to the arrest affidavit from Orange County Sheriff's Office, the victim was found in the master bedroom -- \\"a large pool of blood at the top of her head (and) a .357 Magnum hand gun (in) the top drawer of a nightstand next to the bed.\\" Ward told police that the couple were the only ones in the house at the time, besides their four dogs. Wilkinson also brought up how Ward acted upon arriving at the police station, during which investigators described him as \\"calm, polite and not really in distress.\\" In several videos from an interrogation room -- which the prosecutor promised would be played in court -- Ward offered an array of stories in phone conversations with family and friends, from \\"It was a tragic accident\\" to \\"Diane killed herself.\\" The next day, medical examiner Joshua Stephany determined preliminarily that the mother of two college-age children had been killed in a homicide. Prosecutors, in opening statements, highlighted the financial troubles facing Ward -- who, along with his wife, had been set to testify in bankruptcy proceedings related to one of his companies a few days before the shooting.

But how will he fare in his fresh feuds with fellow outsiders Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina? A week ago Trump said he hoped Carson would ‚Äúhit‚Äù him, because Trump ‚Äúlove[s] to counterpunch.‚Äù Does he ever. Carson, who is gaining fast on frontrunner Trump in a new poll today, took a mild shot at what Trump‚Äôs self-described ‚Äúbig league‚Äù Christian faith. Pressed by reporters during a campaign stop in Anaheim, Calif., to respond to Trump‚Äôscriticisms that Carson isn‚Äôt qualified to be president, the retired neurosurgeon initially declined. But when asked to contrast himself with the New York billionaire, Carson responded, ‚Äú‚Ä¶I realize where my success has come from, and I don‚Äôt any way deny my faith in God,‚Äù said Carson. Carson went on to cite favorite scriptures that ‚Äúhumility and fear of the Lord are riches in honor and life,‚Äù saying that he didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúthat impression with‚Äù Trump. That was a swipe at Trump who bragged that he likely hadn‚Äôt ever felt the need to ask God‚Äôs forgiveness. On CNN today, Trump unloaded on Carson: ‚ÄúLook at his faith and you‚Äôre not going to find so much. And you look at his views on abortion which were horrendous, and that‚Äôs I think why I‚Äôm leading with all the evangelicals. I‚Äôm leading Ben Carson by a lot I‚Äôm almost double his numbers.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know Ben Carson, perhaps ‚Äì you know ‚Äì an okay doctor‚Ä¶we‚Äôre not talking about a great ‚Äì he was an okay doctor.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd now, because he‚Äôs a doctor and he hired one nurse, he‚Äôs going to end up being president of the United States?‚Äù ‚ÄúFor him to read from the Bible in his memory, it looked like it memorized it about two minutes before he went on stage.‚Äù But Carson isn‚Äôt the only target of Trump‚Äôs wrath. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who also gained ground on Trump in CNN‚Äôs poll out today, got a dose too. In an interview with Rolling Stone Trump mocked Fiorina‚Äôs appearance: ‚Äú‚ÄòLook at that face!‚Äô he cries. ‚ÄòWould anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!‚Äô The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. ‚ÄòI mean, she‚Äôs a woman, and I‚Äôm not s‚Äôposedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?‚Äô‚Äù Fiorina declined to respond in kind during an interview on ‚ÄúThe Kelly File‚Äù saying instead, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to spend a single cycle wondering what Donald Trump means. But maybe just maybe I‚Äôm getting under his skin a little bit because I‚Äôm climbing in the polls.‚Äù In a phone call to ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù today, Trump claimed he was not referring to her appearance but instead, ‚Äúabout persona.‚Äù But as Trump‚Äôs own comments to Rolling Stone make clear any disparagement of women‚Äôs appearances is a fraught subject for the GOP frontrunner. Trump did not, however, shy away from continuing to attack Fiorina‚Äôs record as a businesswoman and her qualifications to be president. Given the strong favorable views of Republicans voters towards Fiorina and Carson, Trump‚Äôs attack-dog approach with his fellow outsiders looks to be a much riskier gambit than his ceaseless trolling of the beleaguered Bush. WALKER JOINS FALL FASHION TREND WITH RE-BOOT AP: ‚ÄúRepublican Scott Walker plans to talk about ‚Äòwreaking havoc‚Äô on Washington D.C. with a Thursday speech at the alma mater of former President Ronald Reagan. Walker's presidential campaign on Tuesday released excerpts of his speech to be delivered at Eureka College in Illinois. Walker is also expected to release weekly ‚Äòday one‚Äô promises that describe action he would plan to take on his first day as president. Walker has already said he will end the Iranian arms deal and propose repealing and replacing the federal health care law on his first day in office. The speech and weekly release of ‚Äòday one‚Äô promises comes as Walker is trying to regain ground after being among the top tier of Republican candidates, only to see his standing drop in recent polls.‚Äù [The Atlantic‚Äôs Molly Ball goes back to where it all began to look for Walker‚Äôs path forward: ‚ÄúFor the past four years, Walker has dominated Wisconsin. His bold agenda shattered the status quo, he shocked the left and united the right, and he couldn‚Äôt be beat. Recalled in 2012, challenged in 2014, he kept on fighting and kept on winning. ‚Ä¶ For Wisconsinites accustomed to Walker‚Äôs dominance, his fall from glory nationally has been disorienting and out of character. Back home, he has always been focused, disciplined, on-message to a fault.‚Äù] Jeb gets a little Trump-y in tax plan - NYT: ‚ÄúFormer Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida challenged some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy on Wednesday by proposing to curtail valuable deductions that benefit businesses and the wealthy and eliminate a loophole that has benefited hedge fund and private equity managers for years. That an establishment Republican candidate has embraced such changes not only highlights how income inequality has altered the tenor of the presidential debate for the party, but also indicates the ideological pull Donald J.

National Geographic brings today‚Äôs biggest science story of two recreational cave divers stumbling upon a new species of human ancestor called Homo naledi. Steven Tucker and Rick Hunter found a cave outside Johannesburg looking for a new adventure in an area known for fossil discoveries, and research. Although much of the area has been trodden over, Tucker and Hunter were hoping to find a new path or a less-explored area. In a narrow cave, barely big enough to fit them through, they found they would be far from disappointed, discovering what appeared to be a vast collection of human bones. But how did this cave collect so many bones? Is it possible that this species buried their dead in some way? Check out this deep read for an account of their findings here.

Explanation:  The given question suggests that if rocks break up much less, it would lead to more soil erosion. Now, let's analyze the process step-by-step to justify the answer. 1. A plant grows near or on a rock - This step is not directly impacted by the perturbation (rocks breaking up less). 2. The plant roots begin to grow - This step is also not directly impacted by the perturbation. 3. Break apart the rock - This step is directly impacted by the perturbation as less breaking up of rocks is mentioned. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - This step can be indirectly impacted since less breaking up of rocks might lead to less surface area exposed to plant acids. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - This step can also be indirectly impacted because the less breaking up of rocks initially might lead to fewer pieces to be further broken down. Overall, the supposed perturbation has an indirect impact on the process that leads to soil erosion. The main steps impacted are steps 4 and 5, where less breaking up of rocks could cause the plant acids to dissolve less rock material and reduce the further breaking down of rock pieces. Consequently, this could contribute to more soil erosion since there are fewer broken rocks to stabilize the soil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(T) is refining its retail strategy with its first flagship store, a location on Chicago‚Äôs Michigan Avenue that goes beyond phones and tablets to show services such as fitness applications and ‚Äúsmartcar‚Äù features.      The 10,000-square-foot (929-square-meter) store, opening Sept. 1 in the shopping mecca known as Chicago‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagnificent Mile,‚Äù is three times larger than the average of the company‚Äôs 2,300 retail outlets. Located across the street from Coach Inc. and Cartier Ltd. stores, it has cement floors, white plastic and reclaimed teak furniture with more than 100 video displays.      With the loss of its exclusive agreement to sell Apple Inc. (AAPL)‚Äôs iPhone and a saturated wireless market that makes it hard to find new subscribers, Dallas-based AT&T is planning to use its stores to gain an edge against Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and T-Mobile USA Inc. The move also pits AT&T against the standard-bearer in consumer-electronics retail, Apple itself.      ‚ÄúWe are very different than Apple,‚Äù Paul Roth, AT&T‚Äôs president of retail sales and services, said in an interview. ‚ÄúIn their stores, the product is the hero. This store is all about the experience.‚Äù      The second-biggest U.S. wireless carrier is looking for ways to show investors it‚Äôs a bargain. Investors are getting a 29 percent discount for AT&T compared to its telecommunications peers on a price-to-earnings basis, up from 18 percent at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AT&T shares fell 0.4 percent to 36.69 today in New York.      No Shadowing      Roth‚Äôs plan is to blend the hands-on approach of Apple stores with a visually dazzling environment. He‚Äôs requiring sales staff to greet visitors within 10 seconds or 10 feet after they‚Äôve entered the store, to make them welcome without shadowing them, he said.      Emulating Apple doesn‚Äôt guarantee success. Nike Inc. (NKE), Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. have each tested the brand- centered retail approach, with mixed results. Nokia, the Espoo, Finland-based mobile-phone maker, has shut stores in New York, Chicago, London and Mexico City in the past three years after starting its own retail chain in 2005.      AT&T has tried to give its store a customer-friendly makeover before. In 2007, it opened its first ‚ÄúAT&T Experience‚Äù store, a 5,000-square-foot Houston location with sales kiosks and product demonstrations.      App Lounge      The Chicago flagship goes beyond the Experience concept, which AT&T has dropped. At the front of the new store is an 18- foot wall of video screens and an App Lounge where people can use 55-inch monitors to test apps for Apple products or for Google Inc.‚Äôs Android system. The shop‚Äôs open layout has a series of ‚Äúboutiques‚Äù where customers can see demonstrations on how to prepare for the Chicago Marathon or examine the texting safety features on a Nissan Leaf.      ‚ÄúCustomers are overwhelmed by technology,‚Äù Roth said. ‚ÄúThey want to know less about the device and more about what it can do for them.‚Äù      The store has 40 employees with as many as 30 on the sales floor at one time, Roth said. There are no cash registers, with staff using tablets or smartphones to make sales.      Flagship stores help companies immerse their customers in everything they have to offer, said Michael Cote, a wireless strategist with the Cote Collaborative in Chicago.      ‚ÄúThese are branding opportunities more than retail outlets,‚Äù Cote said. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs important here is that AT&T will be the first carrier to have an ‚Äòexperiential‚Äô flagship store on the Magnificent Mile.‚Äù      Verizon Overhaul      Verizon Wireless, which has a store about two blocks away from AT&T on Michigan Avenue, has started an overhaul of its stores to keep up with the trend in retail toward giving customers more access to sample devices.      The nation‚Äôs largest wireless carrier plans to have 60 stores outfitted this year with a new look featuring white interiors with blond wood, fewer counters separating staff from customers and products displayed on tables instead of walls, said Thomas Pica, a Verizon Wireless spokesman. The Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based company hasn‚Äôt designated a flagship store, he said.      Sprint has had a flagship site in New York, prominently located on the first floor of the angular Flatiron Building, since 1997. Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) unit T-Mobile‚Äôs flagship is also in New York, near Times Square.      The model for success with a self-branded store is Cupertino, California-based Apple, said Lee Peterson, executive vice president of creative services at WD Partners, a retail strategy and design company based in Dublin, Ohio.      ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no magic bullet,‚Äù said Peterson, whose clients include Best Buy Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. ‚ÄúGimmickry doesn‚Äôt work. Lounges don‚Äôt work. We try to convince clients that it‚Äôs what the salesperson knows about the customer and the product that matters.‚Äù      Apple, which had 372 stores around the world at the end of June, is preparing to introduce the next version of the iPhone on Sept. 12, two people with knowledge of the company‚Äôs plans said last month.

All you needed was the biggest bomb, and everyone else kept their mouths shut. Then more people figured out how to make that bomb. And then all sorts of other threats‚Äìbiological agents, computer viruses, and UAVs‚Äìcomplicated the landscape.      advertisement      advertisement      Consider this in the context of AT&T. There was a time when AT&T controlled the world‚Äìor at least iPhones. Before too long, however, AT&T had lost its exclusive on Apple‚Äôs category-crushing product, and a loosely organized association of Android phones clouded consumer preference again. So what does AT&T do now? They‚Äôre no longer the only carrier with the most coveted phone. Their net income is up and customer churn has been low, but its biggest tactical advantage has been squandered. Now it‚Äôs time to take this battle to the street. Specifically, Chicago‚Äôs busy Michigan Avenue. That‚Äôs where, this weekend, following a few years of planning, AT&T is opening its first ever flagship store. There, as 60,000 people per day pass by Cartier, Louis Vuitton, and Coach, they‚Äôll see AT&T‚Äôs new 10,000-square-foot retail mecca, a store that AT&T hopes to ‚Äúbring life to the brand,‚Äù according to store manager Christina Cheng. View the Tour Here Upon entering the store, you‚Äôll first see an atrium ringed with LEDs. Employees will be on hand to greet all the customers, I‚Äôm told, because AT&T‚Äôs focus groups have discovered that it‚Äôs personal greetings that make customers feel welcome‚Äìnot architectural bells and whistles. Even customers carrying phones from Verizon and T-Mobile can play with a nearby touchscreen table loaded with AT&T‚Äôs favorite apps. Just click a category, preview the page, and then download it on your smartphone through Bluetooth, QR code, or a simple URL.      advertisement      Tucked in a corner nearby, a stage backed by a small tower of LCDs allows customers to play head-to-head, Kinect-style motion games. Does this have much of anything to do with AT&T itself? Not really, but it supports ‚Äúa vibe of exploration‚Äù Cheng tells me. This stage will double as a place for both product announcements and presentations from local app developers. That area is just an iPhone‚Äôs throw from a (shorter) electronics table featuring apps and gadgets for kids. The App Bar is in the same vicinity, staffed by App Tenders. Unlike Apple‚Äôs Genius Bar‚Äìthe clear line of inspiration here‚Äìthese staffers don‚Äôt handle any serious problems. Rather, they suggest apps based on your tastes, ‚Äúlike your local barista would recommend something for you,‚Äù Cheng says. Again, it reinforces the casualness of the store‚Äìit‚Äôs so casual, in fact, that it doesn‚Äôt even have a checkout counter. Employees ring up customers at mobile terminals. The deeper diagnostic work is tucked in the back, a series of cozy tables for one-on-one conversations, all wrapped in a studio space filled with large splash walls of Chicago designers who‚Äôve designed limited edition, custom cases only available at AT&T‚Äôs flagship. It‚Äôd be easy to simply label the whole experience an Apple Store      clone. And indeed, you do feel Cupertino‚Äôs influences, from the App Bar to the expansive open tables full of electronics. But if the Apple Store feels like a modern museum that you‚Äôre free to touch, AT&T‚Äôs flagship feels more like a rich person‚Äôs basement loaded with toys. The store is one wood-burning oven away from doubling as a high-end pizza and wine bar. I‚Äôm also reminded a bit of REI as I walk past the Lifestyle Boutiques‚Äìtables dedicated to particular interests, like health and fitness, productivity, and photography/sharing. Cheng tells me that she‚Äôs staffing these tables with knowledgeable experts (much like the staff at REI always seems to be scraping the mud off their boots before walking into work). A former photojournalist will introduce shoppers to their photography peripherals. A certified personal trainer will be discussing Fitbits and tablet connectivity. Across the store, AT&T has set up its Experience Platform, which is pretty much a big budget CES booth come to life. Each space represents part of a consumer‚Äôs life, from a Nissan Leaf parked in the corner, which shoppers can enter and play with in-car phone connectivity, to a model kitchen outfitted with AT&T‚Äôs beta home automation software, to a four-couched living room set up, filled with Xbox 360s and AT&T U-verse.      advertisement      ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have this area, [our services are] just a list,‚Äù Cheng explains. ‚ÄúFor this much a month you can do this, or for this much a month you can do that.‚Äô‚Äù Instead, shoppers can actually sit on a couch, try out fiber-optic cable and beam content to sample phones and tablets that they‚Äôre simply handed, completely untethered, to test out and try new techniques. To the skeptic, it‚Äôs a lot of empty demo space in a premium retail strip that rents for 450 a square foot. ‚ÄúOur main focus is not sales,‚Äù Cheng explains. ‚ÄúOur traditional metrics may not work for here, but we‚Äôll be successful in other ways.‚Äù She may be right. It‚Äôs in the Experience Platform‚Äìthis floor space-swallowing digital mise en scene‚Äìthat you really see AT&T‚Äôs plan with its flagship, to sell their current and future services, not as a promise of another new iPhone and faster data, but as platform-agnostic interconnectivity. It‚Äôs driving to work. It‚Äôs making dinner. It‚Äôs digital idealism free from the bounds of any phone, but very closely tied to AT&T itself. So imagine my surprise when I‚Äôve circled the mega boutique store and notice, for the first time, all of AT&T‚Äôs actual phones are on display. They‚Äôre sitting on a series of tables, splitting the grand room right down the middle‚Äìpositioned in an obvious yet surely overlooked spot, the physical and metaphorical backbone of the store. Check out more images of AT&T‚Äôs Chicago flagship store here. |||||Summary:","output":"AT&T is opening its first flagship store on Chicago's Michigan Avenue, shifting the retail experience to go beyond selling phones and tablets to showcasing services such as fitness applications and \\"smartcar\\" features.

Movie title: Final Destination 3 Context: High school student Wendy Christensen visits an amusement park with her boyfriend Jason Wise, best friend Carrie Dreyer, and Carrie's boyfriend Kevin Fischer for their senior class field trip. As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and roller coaster cars will fail, killing everyone on board. When she panics a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride, including Kevin; best friends Ashley Fruend and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goths Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. As they leave they witness the roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy devastated. The next day, Kevin tells Wendy about the explosion of Flight 180 and the subsequent deaths of the survivors. Believing that Kevin is mocking her, Wendy dismisses his theory and leaves. Later on, Ashley and Ashlyn are killed at a tanning salon when a loosened shelf falls and locks them in the overheating tanning beds. Now convinced that Death is still after them, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using omens hidden within photos that were taken of them the night of the accident. Frankie dies next at a drive-thru when a runaway truck crashes into the back of Kevin's truck, causing the engine fan to blow out and slice off the back of Frankie's head. The next day, they try to save Lewis at the gym, but he tells them he doesn't believe them shortly before two iron weights from the machine he is using swing down and crush his head. Next, they find Ian and Erin working at a hardware store. Wendy manages to save Ian before he is impaled by falling planks of wood, but a chain reaction causes Erin to fall backwards onto a nail gun, and she is shot repeatedly through the head. This leaves Ian devastated, and causes him to resent Wendy. Later, Wendy learns that her sister Julie was also on the roller coaster, and rushes to the county fair to save her. She and...

Please write a short summary for the following article: An Enclave With Rustic Charm Douglas Healey for The New York Times RUSTIC POSTCARD In Weston, the overwhelming home style is the stoic white colonial, often set back behind stone walls, like this house on Kettle Creek Road. IT‚ÄôS not hard to understand why Puritan settlers in Connecticut slapped the Devil‚Äôs name on so many ridges, rivers and gorges. These barren areas were probably so difficult to farm or even traverse that they might have seemed cursed. The settlers of Weston, a town in Fairfield County 50 miles from Manhattan, appear to have been similarly motivated in naming Devil‚Äôs Den, a section near Redding. Yet although the rolling terrain might once have engendered superstition, it is now embraced as a sprawling 1,720-acre preserve hugely popular with hikers. Early European arrivals were also responsible for many of the 50 or so dams in Weston, which they used to mill grain and lumber. The waterfall from one cascades down the West Branch of the Saugatuck River by the terrace of the Cobb‚Äôs Mill Inn, one of the town‚Äôs few businesses until its recent closure. There is another waterfall on a stony slope at the corner of Weston and River Roads. A third, resembling a veil, can be seen along Old Redding Road. Picturesque as they are, however, today the dams are viewed as a potential environmental hazard. They present a barrier to the spawning grounds of certain indigenous fish ‚Äî alewife, for instance, which swim upstream to lay their eggs. As a result, a partnership led by the state Nature Conservancy and made up of officials from Weston and nearby towns, the state Department of Environmental Protection and the local water company has embarked on a mission to remove some of the dams or equip them with fish channels. One of these detours is in Weston, with another planned for Hasen Pond Dam on Lyons Plain Road, which once provided power for the Bradley Edge Tool Company, a maker of axes. Rob Denkin, who recently relocated to Weston from California, appreciates this kind of conservation-mindedness ‚Äî especially as it has influenced the town to preserve about 5 of its 21 square miles of land as open space. Part of the reason for his move to the East Coast, Mr. Denkin said, was so that his daughter, Sierra, could be closer to her grandparents, who live in nearby Westport. (Sierra got her name from the Sierra Nevada mountains, where her father and mother, Jennifer, fell in love.) He picked Weston over other enclaves because of its generous two-acre zoning. On the West Coast, he treasured his frequent camping trips to other Sierra mountains, near Lake Tahoe, and an overly paved suburb was the last thing he wanted, he said. Yet when Mr. Denkin, a psychologist, first saw his four-bedroom Weston contemporary house up close, he recalls it as having almost too much nature going on. Because the house was in foreclosure and had sat empty for months, the branches of a tree had been left to all but envelop the roof. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm crazy, but I was able to see past all of it,‚Äù said Mr. Denkin, who paid 430,000 for the property in 2009 and then spent 100,000 to replace cracked tiles and leaking sunroom windows, and remove that errant tree. And the investment seems smart. Last year, while Mr. Denkin prepared for his move back East, he rented out the house, during which time somebody was impressed enough with it to make a 700,000 offer. When there are so many trees in a place removing a few can sometimes be beneficial, particularly if selling the wood can help out poorer members of the community, said Dawn Egan, a resident who heads the nonprofit Weston Warm-Up Fund. The fund defrays heating bills for people who can‚Äôt afford to pay them, Ms. Egan said, adding that this winter it dispersed 100,000 in aid to 52 homes. One way the fund raises money is to cut down oak trees on Ms. Egan‚Äôs 22-acre property so that they can be sold as firewood, last year netting 8,000. Ms. Egan has sworn off heating oil for her own custom-built 10,000-square-foot Queen Anne-style house, relying instead on eight geothermal wells. They did represent a substantial chunk of the 5.5 million cost of the home, she acknowledged. But putting them in was ‚Äúthe right thing to do, and good for the environment.‚Äù Unlike many communities in Fairfield County, Weston lacks a central town green, as its first European residents, who came from nearby Fairfield, generally lived on scattered farms. And change comes slowly. Its population is 10,200 ‚Äî almost the same as it was a decade ago. Despite its abundance of streams and rivers, the town never was a place of large-scale manufacturing like nearby Georgetown or Danbury.

The people who first lived there named a section of the town \\"Devil's Den\\" because the land was not good for farming. Today, a big part of the land has been preserved as open space, with lots of trees and trails for people to enjoy. Some of the old dams in the town have been changed to help protect the environment and the fish that live there. The people in Weston care about their community and try to help each other, like helping families who can't pay their heating bills during winter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You can usually tell that a yarn is chunky just by looking at it. Chunky yarn is only one term used to identify yarn types within the broader \\"bulky yarn\\" category. Many yarn brands will label the yarn as \\"chunky yarn,\\" but there are a few other terms that brands may use to describe the yarn. These terms include \\"craft\\" and \\"rug\\" yarn. Check the label to be sure that a yarn is chunky.  Another way to identify chunky yarn is by its yarn weight symbol. The symbol for chunky yarn and all other forms of bulky yarn is \\"5.\\"  A thicker yarn category is category 6, which is \\"super bulky.\\" Some yarns in this category might be called \\"super chunky.\\" Super chunky yarn and chunky yarn are not quite the same, so you should keep that in mind when making your yarn selection. Yarns can be made from different fibers, even yarns of a single thickness. Each fiber will have a different texture and appearance. Experiment with different fibers until you find one that you like.  As a general tip, consider the intended use of the project when picking out a fiber material. A blanket or scarf will need a softer yarn fiber than a rug or handbag would probably need. Acrylic wool is a mix of natural and synthetic fibers. It tends to be inexpensive and durable, making it ideal for projects like rugs and purses. It can also be used for sweaters and scarves but may not be soft enough for those with sensitive skin. Cotton wool is soft, durable, and natural. It is generally preferred for sweaters and scarves but may still be too rough for those with very sensitive skin, like infants and toddlers. The softest wools are cashmere, silk, mohair, lambs, and alpaca. Cashmere and silk wools are typically used for scarves, shawls, and wraps, but they are more delicate and require more care. Mohair, lambswool, and alpaca wool tend to be used for blankets and sweaters, but they also require special care. This step applies to any yarn you shop for, and chunky yarn is no exception. You'll need to figure out which color or colors you want to use for your project. Use any color that you like or that will meet the needs of your project.  Once you figure it out, buy the number of skeins you will need. It's better to have too many than too few. The dye can be slightly different from batch to batch, so buying the same hue by name at two different times can result in having two slightly different shades. You can avoid this problem if you buy the yarn all at once. To be on the safe side, you should also check the \\"lot\\" or \\"dye lot\\" number on the back label of each skein. Make sure that the dye lot number on each skein is the same before you buy them. Otherwise, you may still end up with different shades. The right crochet hook to use can vary by project and yarn type. If you are using a pattern, then the hook size might be indicated in the pattern. If you are not using a pattern, then check the yarn label for a recommendation. If you are not sure what hook size to use, choose a hook size that falls within the standard recommended range.  Larger hooks tend to be best for chunky yarn. In U.S. sizes, look for a hook between K-10-1/2 and M-13. In metric sizes, look for a hook between 6.5 and 9 mm. If you end up picking a super chunky yarn, the recommended hook size is M-13 and up in U.S. sizes or 9 mm and up in metric sizes. Summary:","output":"To identify chunky yarn, look for the label that indicates it as \\"chunky yarn\\" or terms like \\"craft\\" and \\"rug\\" yarn. Check for the yarn weight symbol \\"5\\" on the label. Be mindful of the difference between chunky yarn (category 5) and super chunky yarn (category 6). Experiment with different fibers, keeping in mind the intended use of your project and the softness or durability required. Choose the desired color and make sure to purchase enough skeins of the same dye lot to avoid different shades. For choosing the right crochet hook, consult the pattern or yarn label for recommendations. Typically, chunky yarn works best with larger hooks (U.S. sizes K-10-1/2 to M-13, or metric sizes 6.5 mm to 9 mm). For super chunky yarn, consider even larger hooks (U.S. sizes M-13 and up, or metric sizes 9 mm and up)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Rebecca English PUBLISHED: 07:44 EST, 29 October 2013 | UPDATED: 19:29 EST, 29 October 2013 It isn't every day that The Queen drives past your front door and the grins on the faces of this excited family were only rivalled by that of the monarch as she cruised through Brixton in her Bentley. Smiling and waving as she rolled through South London, the Queen was spotted by the woman and two children as she rolled past the steps of their home on her way to an  inner city riding centre. Joined by daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall, the monarch, still a keen rider herself at 87, was visiting the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in gang-ridden Brixton. He added: 'I‚Äôm really surprised she [the Queen] is coming to","output":"Brixton, especially considering the challenges this area has faced, but it's a testament to her commitment to supporting local communities and fostering a love for equestrian activities among the younger generation.' The visit was a rare, yet deeply meaningful, event for the residents of Brixton, an area that has long struggled with issues of crime and violence. The presence of the Queen, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall, demonstrated their willingness to bring attention to and encourage opportunities for youth in underprivileged areas. As the royal entourage approached the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre, a palpable sense of excitement and anticipation filled the air. The facility, which provides recreational and educational activities for disadvantaged children and young people, has become a beacon of hope for the Brixton community. The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed by a lively crowd of cheering children and staff members, all eager to demonstrate their equestrian skills and share their personal stories of growth and resilience. Guided by the dedicated staff, the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall toured the facility, taking the time to engage with the eager young riders, asking questions about their experiences at the club and offering words of encouragement. The duo also met with the hardworking volunteers, without whom the club would not be able to operate. They expressed their gratitude for the valuable services provided by the staff and emphasized the importance of supporting community projects such as these. One poignant moment during the visit occurred when a young rider named Kadija, who faced significant personal challenges before joining the club, presented the Queen with an original drawing of a horse she had created as a token of appreciation. Visibly moved by Kadija's gesture, the Queen thanked her and praised her artistic abilities and determination to overcome her struggles. The exchange symbolized the transformative power of community programs like the Ebony Horse Club, which can foster positive change and offer hope to those in need. As the visit concluded, the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall addressed the gathered crowd. The Queen acknowledged the incredible work being done by the Ebony Horse Club staff and reiterated her commitment to supporting similar initiatives throughout the United Kingdom. She also commended the young riders for their dedication and hard work, encouraging them to continue pursuing their passions and to never allow their circumstances to define who they are. The Queen's visit to the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in Brixton may have been an exceptional day for the institution and the community, but the lasting impact of her presence will undoubtedly resonate with the residents and inspire hope for a brighter future. The determination of the Brixton community and the efforts of the staff and volunteers at the centre serve as a powerful reminder of the critical role that supportive community initiatives play in transforming lives and building a stronger and more unified society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Open a can of tuna.","output":"Opening a can of tuna may seem like a simple task, but it requires a bit of technique and the right tools to do it safely and efficiently. The following is a detailed, step-by-step guide to help someone go about accomplishing this goal: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials: To open a can of tuna, one would need a can opener (manual or electric), a bowl to empty the contents into, a fork to flake the tuna, and a cloth or paper towel to clean up any spills. 2. Prepare the workspace: Ensure the workspace is clean, stable, and has enough lighting. Place the can, can opener, bowl, fork, and cloth or paper towel within easy reach. 3. Inspect the can: Before opening the can, inspect it for any dents, leaks, or bulging. If the can appears damaged, it may not be safe to consume the contents. In that case, discard the can and use another one. 4. Position the can opener: If using a manual can opener, place the opener on the top of the can, aligning the cutting wheel with the inner edge of the can's lid. For an electric can opener, follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to properly position the can. 5. Begin cutting: For a manual can opener, apply even pressure to the top of the can while turning the handle clockwise. This process will cause the cutting wheel to pierce the lid and begin cutting along the edge. For an electric can opener, the process is similar, but the unit will do the work of cutting while the user holds the can in position. 6. Continue cutting around the edge: Keep turning the handle (or holding the can in position for electric openers) until the cutting wheel has made a full rotation around the entire edge of the can's lid. 7. Carefully lift the lid: Using the can opener's built-in lid lifter or a fork, carefully lift the lid away from the can. Be cautious, as the edge of the lid may be sharp. 8. Drain the liquid: Most cans of tuna have some type of liquid in them, either oil or water. Hold the can over the sink while using the partially detached lid as a strainer to drain the liquid from the can. Press the lid gently against the tuna to squeeze out any excess liquid. 9. Remove the lid completely: Once the liquid has been drained, carefully remove the lid entirely from the can, using a fork or the lid lifter on the can opener. Dispose of the lid safely, being mindful of the sharp edges. 10. Transfer the tuna to a bowl: Using a fork, scoop the tuna out of the can and into the bowl. Flake the tuna apart, if desired. 11. Clean up: Wipe down the workspace with the cloth or paper towel to clean up any spills, and wash the can opener, fork, and any other utensils used. 12. Enjoy your opened can of tuna: The tuna is now ready to be consumed or used for recipes such as sandwiches, salads, or casseroles. Remember, safety is important when using sharp tools like a can opener, so always handle them with care and focus on the task at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many drivers making complaints against Toyota and the government say their acceleration problems had nothing to do with floor mat interference or sticky gas pedals .Outside experts have suggested electronic problems. House lawmakers expressed serious criticism on Toyoda,the grandson of the company's founder. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration(NHTSA)is seeking records on Toyota's recalls and is conducting its own review on whether electronics were behind the car faults.NHTSA also continues to look into steering complaints from drivers of the popular Corolla model. Toyota has recalled 8.5 million cars,more than 6 million of them in the United States. It may be a while before car buyers believe that Toyota really makes safe cars.

Information:  - Palawan (Pron. , from ), officially the Province of Palawan , is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - Sulawesi, formerly known as Celebes (or ), is an island in Indonesia. One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's eleventh-largest island, it is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands. Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra have larger populations.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - Panay is a triangular island in the Philippines located in the western part of the Visayas. It is about across, ranking the sixth largest of the islands in the country. Politically, it is divided into four provinces: Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Iloilo, all in the Western Visayas Region. It is located southeast of the island of Mindoro and northwest of Negros, separated by the Guimaras Strait. Between Negros and Panay Island lie the island-province of Guimaras. To the north and northeast is the Sibuyan Sea and the islands of Romblon; to the west and southwest is the Sulu Sea and to the south is Panay Gulf.  - Mindoro is the seventh-largest island in the Philippines. It is located off the coast of Luzon, and northeast of Palawan. The southern coast of Mindoro forms the northeastern extremum of the Sulu Sea.  - Sarawak is one of the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo (Sabah being the other state). This territory has a certain level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary. Sarawak is in northwest Borneo, bordering the state of Sabah to the northeast, Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of Borneo, to the south, and the independent state of Brunei in the northwest. The capital city, Kuching, is the economic centre of the state and the seat of the Sarawak state government. Other cities and towns in Sarawak include Miri, Sibu, and Bintulu. As of the 2015 census in Malaysia, the total population of Sarawak is 2,636,000. Sarawak has an equatorial climate with tropical rainforests and abundant animal and plant species. It has several prominent cave systems at Gunung Mulu National Park. Rajang River is the longest river in Malaysia; Bakun Dam, one of the largest dams in Southeast Asia, is located on one of its tributaries, the Balui River. Mount Murud is the highest point in Sarawak.  - The Sama-Bajau refers to several Austronesian ethnic groups of Maritime Southeast Asia with their origins from the southern Philippines. The name collectively refers to related people who usually call themselves the Sama or Samah; or are known by the exonyms Bajau (also spelled Badjao, Bajaw, Badjau, Badjaw, Bajo or Bayao) and Samal or Siyamal (the latter being considered offensive). They usually live a seaborne lifestyle, and use small wooden sailing vessels such as the \\"perahu\\" (\\"layag\\" in Meranau), \\"djenging\\", \\"balutu\\", \\"lepa\\", \\"pilang\\", and \\"vinta\\" (or \\"lepa-lepa\\"). Some Sama-Bajau groups native to Sabah are also known for their traditional horse culture.  - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:  - A slit drum is a hollow percussion instrument. In spite of the name, it is not a true drum but an idiophone, usually carved or constructed from bamboo or wood into a box with one or more slits in the top. Most slit drums have one slit, though two and three slits (cut into the shape of an \\"H\\") occur. If the resultant tongues are different width or thicknesses, the drum will produce two different pitches. It is used throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. In Africa such drums, strategically situated for optimal acoustic transmission (e.g., along a river or valley), have been used for long-distance communication.  - The Agung a Tamlang is a type of Philippine slit drum made of hollowed out bamboo in imitation of the real agung . Pitch is determined by the length and depth of the slit . The agung a tamlang is used as practice for the real agung : players either use either one agung a tamlang ( hold it with one hand and using the other to strike it with a beater ) or using two agung a tamlangs where the other agung is held with one 's feet .  - The agung is a set of two wide-rimmed, vertically suspended gongs used by the Maguindanao, Maranao, Sama-Bajau and Tausug people of the Philippines as a supportive instrument in kulintang ensembles. The agung is also ubiquitous among other groups found in Palawan, Panay, Mindoro, Mindanao, Sabah, Sulawesi, Sarawak and Kalimantan as an integral part of the agung orchestra.  - Kalimantan is the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo. It comprises 73% of the island's area. The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are Brunei and East Malaysia.  - The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.  - Mindanao is the second largest and southernmost major island in the Philippines. It is also the name of one of the three island groups in the country (the other two being Luzon and the Visayas), consisting of the island of Mindanao and smaller outlying islands. Davao City is the largest city in Mindanao. As of the 2010 census, the island's population itself is 20,281,545 people, while the Mindanao island group has 21,968,174 inhabitants. Davao City is the most populous in Mindanao as 1,632,991 population, and the 2nd is Zamboanga City as 861,799 population, the 3rd is Cagayan de Oro City as 675,950 population, and followed by General Santos City as 594,446 population as of 2015 census.  - Sabah, nicknamed \\"Negeri Di Bawah Bayu\\" (\\"Land Below the Wind\\"), is one of the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo (Sarawak being the other state). This territory has a certain level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary which differentiates it from the Malaysian Peninsula states. Sabah is situated in northern Borneo, bordering the state of Sarawak to the southwest, Kalimantan to the south, while separated by sea from the Federal Territory of Labuan in the west and the Philippines to the north and east. Kota Kinabalu is the capital city as well the economic centre for the state and the seat for the Sabah state government. Other major towns in Sabah include Sandakan and Tawau. As of the 2015 census in Malaysia, the state's population is 3,543,500. Sabah has an equatorial climate with tropical rainforests and abundant animal and plant species. The state has a long mountain ranges in the west side which formed as part of the Crocker Range National Park. Kinabatangan River is the second longest river in Malaysia while Mount Kinabalu is the highest point of Sabah as well for Malaysia.  - A gong (from Javanese, Indonesian, Malay: \\"gong\\"; Chinese: ; pinyin: lu√≥) is an African, East and South East Asian musical percussion instrument that takes the form of a flat, circular metal disc which is hit with a mallet. It originated in China and later spread to Southeast Asia, and it can also be used in the percussion section of Western symphony orchestra.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km¬≤ (11.7 million square¬†miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater (including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles); struck, scraped or rubbed by hand; or struck against another similar instrument. The percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments, following the human voice.    'agung a tamlang' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'subclass of'?

To answer the original question, I need to identify the two factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty. Step 1: Analyze the question. The question asks about two factors that determine the possibility of withdrawing from a treaty. Step 2: Identify the two factors. Based on general knowledge, there are two main factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty: 1. Withdrawal provisions within the treaty: If the treaty itself explicitly includes clauses or provisions that allow for withdrawal under specific conditions, then a party can withdraw in accordance with those provisions. 2. Permissible under customary international law: If the treaty does not have explicit withdrawal provisions, it may still be possible to withdraw if it is permissible under customary international law. Customary international law may allow for withdrawal under certain circumstances, such as a fundamental change in circumstances or a violation of the treaty terms by another party. In conclusion, the two factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty are the withdrawal provisions within the treaty itself and the permissibility under customary international law."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Carey has been put in charge by US group Liberty Media, which is buying a controlling shareholding from CVC. \\"You've got to understand what everybody wants and then find a path,\\" he said. \\"That is not a task for a committee, as they tend to become bureaucratic. But there also can't be a dictatorship, even if probably they are used to it.\\" The remarks, made in an interview on the official F1 website on Carey's visit to last weekend's Singapore Grand Prix, will be interpreted as a reference to the way Bernie Ecclestone has run F1 for the past 40 years. Ecclestone, who is 86 next month, has been kept on by the new owners as chief executive, but there has been no official confirmation of the length of time he will stay. Carey, a long-time lieutenant of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said: \\"With all credit to Bernie, he's had enormous success - the world admires Bernie for the business that he has built. But I still think that there is another level that we can take Formula 1 to. \\"For the first few months - call it 100 days - it is largely listening and meeting - and digesting. And then come out of that phase with a degree of visions that continue to be shaped. Nothing is ever written in stone. Bernie is the CEO, so Bernie is going to lead it and I will work with Bernie to establish some kind of strategic plan to where you want to go.\\" Ecclestone, who is renowned for his distaste for working with other people and likes to have control in his affairs, told Sky Sports: \\"If, by chance, things aren't going the way I think would be the right way then I will disappear for sure.\\" But he added: \\"There is going to be no problem with Chase. We will work together. He has got expertise that I haven't. We need to be in America. He knows America, he knows television and he can help us a lot.\\" Liberty believes it can expand F1's global reach and revenues by exploiting new avenues. Carey has singled out expansion in the US, Americas and Asia, and a more effective use of digital media. F1 has historically struggled to maintain a consistent presence in the US market, which many have said is a result of Ecclestone's business model of demanding such large fees from circuits for the rights to hold the race that they struggle to establish a workable business plan. Carey said: \\"It is too early to have a clear plan, but we clearly will have a plan to develop America, to be in the right market. \\"There is a big untapped audience in the US. I don't want to criticise the efforts in the past, because I don't know the efforts in the past. \\"Formula 1 is a great premium brand and that means to me that you want to be at a location like Los Angeles, New York or Miami. Ideally in the great cities in the world.\\" Chase said another of his targets was to \\"widen the core television experience to today's needs\\". He added: \\"I believe that a good digital product makes the television product more rewarding. \\"Marketing the sport, in telling the story of the stars and heroes and the incredible machines. Then strengthen it geographically. \\"So there is not 'the cash cow', but there is growth possibility in every area.\\" Summary:","output":"A man named Carey has been given a big job by a company called Liberty Media.

Context: I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

Article: In a certain store where they sell puddings, a number of these delicious things are laid out in a row during the Christmas season. Here you may select the one which is most to your taste, and you are even allowed to sample them before coming to a decision. I have often wondered whether some people, who had no intention of making a purchase, would take advantage of this privilege. One day I asked this question of the shop girl, and I learned it was indeed the case. \\"Now there's one old gentleman, for instance,\\" she told me, \\"he comes here almost every week and samples each one of the puddings, though he never buys anything, and I suspect he never will. I remember him from last year and the year before that, too. Well, let him come if he wants it, and welcome to it. And what's more, I hope there are a lot more stores where he can go and get his share. He looks as if he needed it all right, and I suppose they can afford it.\\" She was still speaking when an elderly gentleman limped up to the counter and began looking closely at the row of puddings with great interest. \\"Why, that's the very gentleman I've been telling you about,\\" whispered the shop girl. \\"Just watch him now.\\" And then turning to him: \\"Would you like to sample them, sir?

Write highlights for this article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. Danger: A study found pregnant women who take antibiotics could be tampering with their child's immune system. Pregnant women who take antibiotics could be putting their unborn children at risk of disease. Researchers have found that drugs used to beat infections can interfere with a baby‚Äôs immune system. By contrast mothers can help to kick-start a child‚Äôs ability to avoid illness by passing on certain germs. A study by the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia in the US showed that bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in fostering the rapid production of infection-fighting white blood cells. They found that, as with humans, mice have a surge of white blood cells around birth, but this response is reduced when their mothers are exposed to antibiotics. This left the creatures much more vulnerable to deadly E. coli infections, especially when they were born prematurely. The researchers showed that signalling mechanisms within the gut‚Äôs vast colony of micro-organisms regulate the production of white blood cells in baby mice. Exposing both the mothers and babies to antibiotics reduced the diversity of gut bacteria, many of which are beneficial, and also impaired resistance to infection in the newborn. Critically ill babies are often treated with antibiotics as a precaution, without proof of infection. The study appeared in the journal Nature Medicine. Hitesh Deshmukh, first author of the study, said: 'At birth, newborns move from a largely sterile environment to one full of microorganisms. 'Animals and humans adapt to this new situation by ramping up the production of granulocytes within the first days of life.' Doctors advised unborn babies benefit from bacteria which builds up their strength, rather than medication. A similar procedure in humans, called a fecal transplant, has recently been successful in treating severe bacterial infection in adults. However, such transplants have not been performed in newborns, and the scientists warn that a lot more research is needed before they can determine what implications these animal results may have in guiding human treatment. Despite the findings, babies will continue to be treated with antibiotics as it is very difficult to determine whether newborns are infected with bacteria. But the research urged clinicians to strive to decrease antibiotic use as a long-term goal.","output":"This article says that taking antibiotics while pregnant may risk a baby's health. Researchers found that antibiotics can interfere with a baby's immune system. Instead, when moms share some germs, it helps babies avoid getting sick. A study showed that having bacteria in the gut helps make white blood cells that fight off infections. When moms have antibiotics, it makes it harder for the baby to fight against bad germs, like E. coli. Doctors say it's better for babies to build up strength from good bacteria instead of taking medicines. While more research is needed, the study suggests that using fewer antibiotics might be a good goal for the long-term."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Americans are very different from Asian people. If you're Asian, you might want to understand the American culture and even adapt to their culture if you work with them. It will be easier for you since you're in their countries. Imagine an American working in China, expecting Chinese co-workers to get along with him when he criticizes them straight out on every single matter in front of everyone. I think they will take him outside and take care of him. It just doesn't work that way with Asian people. If you're an American boss giving your Asian employee a review, you will see that they will have a problem with your negative remarks. They will think that you don't like them, disrespectful, and want to get rid of them; when in fact, you're just doing your job. Of course, it's not fair for you as an American boss but just expect that it can be something that is on your Asian employee's mind. The Americans can't get along well with the Asians probably because  _  . A) their cultures are different B) they don't like each other C) both of them are too proud D) they have different political views Answer:","output":"The primary reason that Americans and Asians may find it difficult to get along with each other is A) their cultures are different. Cultural differences can create misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and challenges in communication between individuals from different backgrounds. When working together, people from different cultures often have expectations of how relationships are built, how decisions are made, and how problems are solved, which can lead to confusion and conflict if not managed effectively. One significant difference between Asian and American cultures is their approach to communication. Many Asian cultures adhere to a high-context communication style, where meaning is conveyed through non-verbal cues, tone of voice, and context. This contrasts with the low-context communication style often found in Western cultures like the United States, where direct speech and explicit information are expected and appreciated. Another cultural difference is related to the concept of face, referred to as \\"mianzi\\" in Chinese culture and \\"cheon\\" (Ï≤ú) in Korean culture among others. This concept plays a vital role in building and maintaining interpersonal relations and social status in many Asian societies. Saving face is critical in these cultures, and any perceived disrespect may lead to loss of face and damaged relationships. In contrast, American culture values more direct and open communication, often leading to misunderstanding or unintentional disrespect when communicating with someone from an Asian background. Moreover, the American emphasis on individualism may conflict with the collectivism that is deeply rooted in many Asian cultures. In collectivist societies, the needs and interests of the family or group are prioritized over that of the individual. This difference in values may cause rifts between coworkers or supervisors, as Asian employees might prioritize harmony and group cohesion, while Americans may place importance on personal achievement and self-expression. In conclusion, both Americans and Asians need to make an effort to understand and respect each other's cultural backgrounds to establish successful and harmonious working relationships. Appropriately communicating and adjusting behaviors can aid in overcoming cultural barriers. It is important to recognize that while cultural differences can be challenging, they also provide an opportunity for individuals to learn, grow, and develop stronger connections with others from diverse backgrounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: KABUL‚ÄîU.S. and Afghan officials on Tuesday said they were getting closer to a deal for U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan, but they differed over whether the U.S. had committed to a letter from President Barack Obama acknowledging mistakes made by the U.S. in the war.      President Hamid Karzai requested that Mr. Obama write the letter in exchange for softening his opposition to letting American forces raid Afghan homes after the coalition's mandate expires in December 2014, said his spokesman, Aimal Faizi. If made, this American gesture would be reciprocated by Kabul's agreement to permit these raids in circumstances when American lives are at risk, he said.      Enlarge Image Afghan policemen check a vehicle in Kabul on Tuesday, two days before a meeting to weigh a security deal. European Pressphoto Agency      More Lull in Taliban Action Not Expected      In Washington, White House and State Department officials wouldn't confirm whether Mr. Obama would send such a letter. White House press secretary Jay Carney said he wouldn't comment on a \\"letter that hasn't been written.\\"      Mr. Faizi said the compromise decision was made in a phone call between Messrs. Karzai and Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday. Mr. Kerry initially offered to write the letter himself, but Mr. Karzai insisted it must come from Mr. Obama, Mr. Faizi said.      The developments came just ahead of Thursday's inauguration of the Loya Jirga, a traditional assembly that would consider the so-called bilateral security agreement between the two countries.      A senior State Department official said Mr. Karzai requested the \\"reassurances, including the option of a letter from the administration.\\" The official said there was no agreement on a letter yet but that one that states the government's position was under discussion.      U.S. officials said they believe that conflicting accounts of the call reflect last-minute political posturing by Mr. Karzai ahead of the Loya Jirga. In the call with Mr. Karzai, Mr. Kerry didn't specify any intention to issue a letter in which the U.S. would apologize for American conduct in the war, U.S. officials said. But the officials said they could envisage issuing a letter in which the U.S. expresses \\"regret\\" for civilian casualties in past military operations, in line with previous U.S. statements.      In the U.S., Republican lawmakers have criticized Mr. Obama for what they see as a willingness to apologize for American military action abroad, and any letter to Mr. Karzai could carry political overtones.      The security agreement, which would provide for a limited American training and counterterrorism force in Afghanistan after 2014, is crucial for continuing international aid, the main source of funding for the Afghan army and police that are facing a resilient Taliban insurgency.      Mr. Obama's letter to Mr. Karzai and the Afghan people is supposed to \\"mention that there were mistakes made in the conduct of military operations by U.S. forces in the past decade, and that the Afghan people have suffered, and we understand their pain, and therefore can give assurances that these mistakes will not be repeated,\\" said Mr. Faizi. He added that Mr. Obama's letter would be presented to the Loya Jirga together with the security deal.      Susan Rice, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, said Tuesday that the president has no intention of apologizing.      \\"There's no such discussion of an apology,\\" she said on PBS. \\"So let's take that off the table. That's not in the cards.\\"      She added that the talks on a security agreement are \\"very close to completion,\\" but added it was \\"possible\\" the two sides won't reach a deal on remaining details.      The U.S. spent hundreds of billions of dollars in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, losing 2,922 American lives in the war so far. Mr. Karzai has repeatedly condemned the U.S. forces for inflicting civilian casualties.      U.S. officials said in recent weeks that they had believed that the draft text of the agreement was ironed out during marathon talks between Messrs. Karzai and Kerry in Kabul in October. Mr. Karzai, however, reopened some of the most contentious issues in recent days.      The dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Vali Nasr, a former senior State Department official dealing with Afghanistan, said Mr. Karzai was shoring up his nationalistic credentials in this latest confrontation with Washington as U.S. troops withdraw.      \\"He has to be viable as a nationalist leader,\\" Mr. Nasr said. \\"He is definitely playing a domestic game.‚Ä¶The Loya Jirga right now puts added pressure on him to appear not to be an American cat's paw.\\"      Mr. Karzai's most-pointed demand to revise the security agreement was his insistence that American troops would no longer be allowed to enter Afghan homes under any circumstances, not even when accompanied by Afghan security forces, after 2014.      Such a blanket ban would severely constrain, if not scuttle altogether, the counterterrorism mission that the U.S. hopes to maintain in Afghanistan to target al Qaeda. It would make it impossible for U.S. personnel to gather intelligence and evidence inside al Qaeda's hide-outs, and would even outlaw rescue missions to recover kidnapped or injured U.S. personnel.      Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan and now is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said counterterrorism raids are \\"the area where the United States is going to be particularly sensitive to restrictions,\\" adding, \\"Forces in combat, under fire, are going to require a little bit of that flexibility.\\"      During Tuesday's phone call with Mr. Karzai, Mr. Kerry suggested that the Americans may be permitted to enter Afghan homes in \\"exceptional circumstances\\" when American troops' lives are at risk, Mr. Faizi said.      Mr. Karzai initially replied by saying he wanted to add both the Afghan proposal and the American language in the draft agreement to be submitted to the Loya Jirga, and let its 2,500 delegates decide. He also invited Mr. Kerry to come to Kabul and try persuading the delegates to accept the American version in a speech to the assembly, an offer the U.S. rejected, Mr. Faizi said.      The Loya Jirga, most of whose delegates were selected by provincial authorities, and whose membership list was approved by Mr. Karzai, is highly unlikely to do anything against the wishes of the Afghan president.      As an alternative, Mr. Faizi said, Mr. Karzai also suggested the U.S. could sign the deal with a new government that is slated to be elected in April.      At the end of the phone call, however, the Afghan president agreed to the \\"exceptional circumstances\\" request in exchange for a letter from Mr. Obama, Mr. Faizi said. The exact wording of that clause in the security agreement will be determined by negotiators from the two countries before the Loya Jirga considers the document, he said.      Mr. Obama's letter should also guarantee that these exceptions \\"will not be misused\\" and \\"strictly defined,\\" Mr. Faizi said.      It is possible, Mr. Faizi acknowledged, that the Loya Jirga may come up with \\"new suggestions\\" to amend the security agreement, requiring a new round of negotiations in coming weeks.      U.S. military commanders initially pressed for the security agreement to be reached by October, saying they needed to start planning for any new post-2014 force as soon as possible. Any further delays would make this planning even more difficult, American officials have said.      ‚ÄîDion Nissenbaum contributed to this article.      Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com and Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.com ||||| KABUL, Afghanistan ‚Äî Months of fraught negotiations and public posturing over how a long-term American military force could remain in Afghanistan have suddenly come down to a demand for a single personal gesture: a display of contrition by President Obama for military mistakes that have hurt Afghans.      Afghan officials said Tuesday that in return for such a letter from Mr. Obama, President Hamid Karzai would end his vehement opposition to American counterterrorism raids on private Afghan homes ‚Äî one of the most contentious issues between allies over a costly dozen-year war ‚Äî clearing the way for an agreement to keep a smaller American troop force in the country past the 2014 withdrawal deadline.      As described by Mr. Karzai‚Äôs spokesman, Aimal Faizi, the letter would be tantamount to an apology, though he did not use that word. But not even that would be enough to ensure the final passage of a security agreement the United States had pressed to have in hand before next year. The Afghans have made final approval subject to an Afghan grand council of elders, a loya jirga, that is to begin meeting on Thursday, and aspects of the security deal remain deeply unpopular with the public.      The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, would not confirm details on Tuesday, but he nodded to the potential deal-breaking potential of the meeting. ‚ÄúThere are ongoing negotiations,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI would simply say this agreement is not reached until it goes through the loya jirga.‚Äù      The 11th-hour discussions were the latest lurch in a start-and-stop negotiation process that has exposed raw feelings between allies, and has also highlighted Mr. Karzai‚Äôs taste for public brinkmanship.      Just two days ago, Afghan officials said that the raid issue had created a stubborn impasse.      Afghan and American officials said that the potential for breakthrough was opened by a phone call from Secretary of State John Kerry to Mr. Karzai on Tuesday.      According to Mr. Faizi, Mr. Kerry offered to write a letter assuring the importance of an agreement and acknowledging American mistakes, and Mr. Karzai issued a counteroffer: He would compromise if the letter was from Mr. Obama instead. Mr. Faizi said Mr. Kerry agreed to those terms.      But Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, flatly denied in an interview with CNN on Tuesday night that there would be any presidential apology. ‚ÄúNo such letter has been drafted or delivered,‚Äù Ms. Rice said. ‚ÄúThere is not a need for the United States to apologize to Afghanistan. Quite the contrary. We have sacrificed and supported them in their democratic progress and in tackling the insurgency and Al Qaeda.‚Äù      A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss continuing negotiations, was more noncommittal, saying that a letter acknowledging past issues like civilian casualties was a possibility being weighed. ‚ÄúWe will consider his request for reassurances, including the option of a letter from the administration stating our position,‚Äù the official said.      Under the Afghan description, in return for the letter, Mr. Karzai would then accept wording that allowed American Special Operations raids to search and detain militants within Afghan homes, but only under ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù to save the lives of American soldiers. That would seem to greatly hamper the American intent behind those operations, which commanders have said are critical to taking the fight directly to Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.      Among members of the Afghan public, though, foreign raids on private homes are seen as deeply offensive, and the prospect of continued American commando operations after 2014 is unlikely to receive a warm reception from the roughly 3,000 delegates to the loya jirga.      But Mr. Faizi said that a letter from Mr. Obama would help win critics over. And Afghan political observers have noted that Mr. Karzai, who despite his harsh negotiation tactics has repeatedly mentioned the importance of a lasting security deal with the United States, had the power of approval over the delegate list, making it more likely he could sway the council.      Mr. Faizi made it clear that the Afghans had a very detailed understanding of what they expected a letter from Mr. Obama to say, and without that there would be no deal.      The letter would clarify what was meant by ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù justifying home raids, and go beyond that as well. ‚ÄúThe idea was to indeed mention that there were mistakes made in the conduct of military operations in the past, in the conduct of military operations by United States forces in the last decade, and that Afghans have suffered, and that we understand the pain and therefore we give assurances and make sure those mistakes are not repeated,‚Äù Mr. Faizi said.      Afghan officials said they expected to see the text of the letter by Wednesday before Mr. Karzai signs off on the security agreement.      With one day remaining to finalize the wording of the security agreement before the loya jirga meets, Mr. Faizi said that was the remaining issue in talks, carried out in their last phase by Mr. Karzai with the American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, and the American military commander, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr.      ‚ÄúThe rest, everything is solved,‚Äù Mr. Faizi said.      He also said that the Afghan side had agreed to acquiesce on another sticking point: the American requirement that the United States retain legal jurisdiction over its soldiers in Afghanistan. In essence, that would make United States military personnel immune to Afghan prosecution for their actions in the country, though they would remain subject to American prosecution.      A similar requirement led to the collapse of talks with Iraq to establish a long-term security deal, and an immediate final withdrawal of American troops from that country in 2011.      In recent weeks, American officials have mentioned that the result in Iraq could be duplicated, and that the 2014 military withdrawal from Afghanistan could be made complete and final if their terms on home raids and legal jurisdiction were not met. ||||| Summary:","output":"The US and Afghan governments are getting closer to a deal regarding the continued presence of US troops in Afghanistan after the coalition's mandate expires in December 2014. Although there have been some differences between the two sides, such as whether an acknowledgment letter from President Barack Obama on past mistakes committed by the US during the war should be sent, progress has been made and both sides have shown a willingness to compromise.

The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the √éle-de-France region.  - A pur√©e (or mash) is cooked food, usually vegetables or legumes, that has been ground, pressed, blended or sieved to the consistency of a soft creamy paste or thick liquid. Pur√©es of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus. The term is of French origin, where it meant in Old French (13th century) \\"purified\\" or \\"refined\\".  - Skordalia or skordhalia / skorthalia (  ( skor√∞aa ) ; in Greek also called  ' aliada / aliatha ) is a thick puree ( or sauce , dip , spread , etc. ) in Greek cuisine made by combining crushed garlic with a bulky base -- which may be a pur√©e of potatoes , walnuts , almonds , or liquid - soaked stale bread -- and then beating in olive oil to make a smooth emulsion . Vinegar is often added .  - Mediterranean cuisine is the food from the lands around the Mediterranean Sea and its preparation. This geographical area broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree, which provides one of the most distinctive features of the region's cooking, olive oil.  - The Balkan Peninsula, or the Balkans, is a peninsula and a cultural area in Eastern and Southeastern Europe with various and disputed borders. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbia-Bulgaria border to the Black Sea.  - Olive oil is a fat obtained from the olive (the fruit of \\"Olea europaea\\"; family Oleaceae), a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin. The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in cooking, whether for frying or as a salad dressing. It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and finds uses in some religions. It is associated with the Mediterranean diet popularized since the 1950s in North America for its possible health benefits. The olive is one of the three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat and the grape.  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.  - The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning \\"European olive\\", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands, Mauritius and R√©union. The species is cultivated in many places and considered naturalized in all the countries of the Mediterranean coast, as well as in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Java, Norfolk Island, California and Bermuda.  - The Mediterranean diet is a modern nutritional recommendation originally inspired by the dietary patterns of Greece, Southern Italy, and Spain in the 1940s and 1950s. The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits, and vegetables, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of non-fish meat products.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1966, numerous pirate radio stations broadcast to the United Kingdom from ships anchored in international waters, specialising in rock and pop music that is not played on BBC Radio. Seventeen-year-old Carl (Tom Sturridge), recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the station \\"Radio Rock\\" anchored in the North Sea. The eclectic crew of disc jockeys and staffers, led by the brash American DJ \\"The Count\\" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), quickly accept Carl as one of their own. At the start of the film Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and Carl conspire to have Carl lose his virginity. Dave has his girlfriend get naked and lie in bed for him while he turns off the lights and goes into the bathroom, where has has Carl hidden. Carl then gets naked and walks into the dark room in an attempt to deceive Dave's girlfriend. However she turns the lights on and sees who was really about to have sex with her, and Carl gets embarrassed and leaves. In London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) resolves to shut down pirate radio stations due to their commercialism and low morals, instructing his subordinate Twatt (Jack Davenport) to find legal loopholes that will serve this end. They attempt to cut off the stations' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed radio stations. Quentin counters this by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) out of retirement and onto Radio Rock, enticing his advertisers to work around the law by paying their bills from abroad. Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry between himself and The Count, who was initially brought to Radio Rock as Gavin's replacement.

When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. ‚ÄúIt is the key to self improvement!‚Äù, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don‚Äôt quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here‚Äôs the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let‚Äôs face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don‚Äôt share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: ‚ÄúI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better‚Äù. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. The writer believes that - people should learn - people should isten - not enough information - people should take feedback Answer:","output":"Embracing failure and accepting critical feedback play a crucial role in personal and professional growth. The right balance between self-confidence and the awareness of one's limitations is essential to make the most out of such opportunities for self-improvement. Here's how feedback and failure can be turned into advantages: 1. Cultivate a growth mindset: A growth mindset emphasizes the belief that skills and abilities can be improved over time. By adopting this perspective, you will be more open to learning from your mistakes and using feedback as a catalyst for growth. 2. Practice active listening: When receiving feedback, listen carefully without being defensive. This will allow you to genuinely understand the other person's perspective and take their advice into account in your future work. 3. Reflect on your experiences: Take the time to ponder on feedback you've received or past failures. Analyze what went wrong, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan to address these shortcomings.  4. Focus on your strengths: Recognize your strengths and leverage them to overcome your weaknesses. By focusing on your strong points, you can develop the confidence needed to tackle your limitations and be more receptive to critical feedback. 5. Develop resilience: Understand that failure is a natural part of the learning process. By building resilience, you'll be able to bounce back more quickly from setbacks and maintain your motivation to keep learning and growing. 6. Foster a supportive and open environment: Encourage open communication within teams to promote the sharing of ideas, constructive criticism, and opportunities for learning. This will create a culture where feedback is not only welcome but actively sought after. 7. Manage your emotions: It's easy to feel hurt by negative feedback or failure. However, learning to manage your emotions and respond positively to such situations can help you stay focused on your goals and continue to grow. 8. Seek mentorship: Find experienced professionals who can provide guidance, support, and constructive criticism as you progress in your career. Their advice and feedback will be invaluable in helping you improve your skills and navigate challenges. By employing these techniques, you can make feedback and failure work to your advantage. Combining self-confidence with an understanding of your limitations creates a productive environment for learning and improvement, fostering personal and professional growth."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: If you're looking for instructions for how to cleanse your body, this is not the book for you.

Q:This article: With Morton, the New York Dolls recorded Too Much Too Soon in 1974 at A&R Studios in New York City. The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together.

To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist.

Walking in to Rosie's you are greeted with a friendly 'hello', a welcoming smile, and a delicious set of deserts displayed right before you. You can either have a seat to your right in some cozy booths, or take a left and grab a drink at their large coffee bar.   I do think that the real treasure here are the baked goods. They are cheap and scrumptious. Their cinnamon rolls are about the size of a human head and are only 3. All of their deserts just taste superb. However, the rest of their food is just alright. I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich and was neither thrilled nor disappointed. The croissant from the sandwich was probably the best part, go figure. I had a side of pasta salad and it was a little bland, but still edible. Overall it was just ok.  It's a new establishment so there are bound to be some kinks that need to be fixed, but like others have said this place has great potential, especially with it's new management and appreciative staff. They're all so nice. It's lovely.  I got word that they are making a breakfast menu and are going to start serving breakfast next week! I definitely think breakfast will be Rosie's forte. OPT: a). negative b). positive","output":"b). positive Explanation: The review is positive because the reviewer talks about the friendly staff, delicious baked goods, cozy place, and potential for improvement.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who is David in a relationship with? Movie plot title: Elegy Movie plot: David Kepesh is a cultural critic and professor, in a state of 'emancipated manhood': His relationships with women are usually casual, brief and sexual in nature. Previously married, he has a son who has never forgiven him for leaving his mother. His friend, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet George O'Hearn, suggests that he \\"bifurcate\\" his life: have conversations and enjoy art with a wife, and \\"keep the sex just for sex\\". David is also in a casual 20-year relationship with Caroline, another former student. He encounters Consuela Castillo, a beautiful and confident student who attends one of his lectures. She captures his attention like no other woman, and they begin a serious relationship. George advises him to leave her before she leaves him, but David cannot bring himself to give her up. They are a couple for a year and a half, during which he continues to sleep with Caroline; neither woman knows of the other's existence. Over dinner, Consuela invites David to her graduation party. After some hesitation, he agrees to attend. On the day of the event, David phones Consuela and claims he is stuck in traffic and it will be unavoidably delayed. In reality, he is sitting in his car, anxious about meeting Consuela's family. Heartbroken, Consuela hangs up, and they end their relationship. Shortly afterward, George suffers a stroke during a poetry conference after David introduces him, and later dies. David realizes too late that he genuinely loved Consuela, and ends his relationship with Caroline. He somewhat mends his relationship with his son, Kenny, when the latter reveals that he is having an affair and indirectly asks David for advice. Two years pass before Consuela and David come into contact again. On New Year's Eve, David arrives home to find a message from Consuela. She mentions that she needs to tell him something before he finds out from someone else. At his apartment, Consuela announces that she has found a lump in her breast and will need surgery. Grief-stricken, David cries and asks her why she didn't tell...

I've been watching it for years now and to me it still don't look right somehow. Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after. Funny but it's the small things I recall best about her, like the way her hair reeked of bonfires and how that little old checkered dress of hers rode right up her thigh with no help from me. After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea. That Mitzi Barker, she was thin as an ear of barley and I always figured a good nosh-up was the least I could do for her troubles. Question: The narrator and Mitzi would eat trout: === The answer to the above question is","output":"Yes, the narrator and Mitzi would eat trout after their encounters. The narrator describes their routine of going up the lane together and spending time with each other, and how he would poach a couple of rainbow trouts for them to share as a meal afterwards. He mentions that Mitzi was very thin, and he felt that providing her with a good meal was the least he could do in return for her company and the moments they shared. The narrator's description of Mitzi and their time together reveals a great deal about their relationship and the circumstances surrounding it. It shows that, despite her being deaf and mute, Mitzi and the narrator shared a deep connection, one that was perhaps strengthened by their simple, shared experiences, such as enjoying a meal of trout by the trout farm. These memories, however, haunt the narrator as he keeps reflecting on that fateful day when something went wrong between them. The sun, in its daily appearance, constantly reminds him of what he has done and how he has failed Mitzi. No matter how hard he tries to escape and hide from the truth, it remains in his mind, tormenting him with the knowledge that if Mitzi were to come back, he could never truly make amends for the harm he has caused. The story of the narrator and Mitzi Barker is one of regret, guilt, and a longing for closure that may never come. It is a poignant reminder of the weight of our actions and how the choices we make can haunt us for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pidgeon was the first person to do this via the Panama Canal, and the first person to solo circumnavigate the world twice. On both trips, he sailed a 34-foot yawl named the \\"Islander\\", which Pidgeon constructed by himself. Prior to his first trip, Pidgeon had no prior experience sailing. He accounts for his adventures in his book, \\"Around the World Single-Handed: The Cruise of the \\"Islander\\"\\" (1932). Biography. Harry Clifford Pidgeon was born 31 August 1869 on a farm in Iowa.

There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, above sea level, and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America.

It is important to provide a comprehensive and detailed answer to ensure a proper understanding of the topic.  The three primary mental states in psychology include conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. 1. Conscious: The conscious mind represents our current awareness and thoughts. It includes everything that we are currently aware of, such as our sensations, perceptions, emotions, and thoughts. The conscious mind is responsible for processing the information we receive from our external environment and internal responses. 2. Preconscious: The preconscious mind contains accessible information that is not currently in our conscious awareness but can be easily brought to the forefront if needed. For example, memories and knowledge that we have stored throughout our lives can be accessed through the preconscious mind when required. 3. Unconscious: The unconscious mind consists of thoughts, feelings, and memories that are hidden away from our conscious awareness. These psychic contents may influence our behavior and decision-making without us realizing it. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, believed that the unconscious mind plays a significant role in shaping human behavior and is the reservoir for repressed and unacceptable desires, thoughts, and feelings. In conclusion, it is crucial to differentiate the three primary mental states in psychology ‚Äì conscious, preconscious, and unconscious ‚Äì to understand their unique roles in influencing human behavior and mental processes.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the names of the two people who were less optimistic about Barrett's erratic behavior?, using the article: Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space.

To keep your scooter still while you practice, you can put the back wheel up against a wall. Alternately, you can just stand on the brake on the back of your scooter to keep it from moving. You could also position the scooter so that the front wheel is over a curb and isn't touching the ground. Once you have rotated the bars as far around as you can with your dominant hand, reach your non-dominant hand under the dominant one to grab the other handle as it comes. Keep spinning the bars towards their starting position, rotating your dominant hand back to a normal, forward-facing grip as you do.  Keep on practicing until you can do this one smooth motion. It‚Äôll be much easier to do the trick when you can spin your handlebars without thinking about it. Once you‚Äôve got the movement sorted, you can practice spinning while the scooter is moving. Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart and swing your scooter between them so it moves front to back. When the scooter reaches it‚Äôs highest point in front of you, try and spin the handles. This is the best way to mimic a real barspin without you having to leave the ground. In order to do a barspin, you‚Äôll need to get some air with a bunny hop. Start riding your scooter at a comfortable speed and then jump straight up in the air. As you do, hold onto the handlebars of the scooter and lift it up with your body. Practice doing a bunny hop until you can jump easily and as high as possible.  The higher you jump, the more time you‚Äôll have to get your barspin perfect and regain control of the handlebars before you hit the ground. See how high you can bunny hop. Make sure you keep your feet firmly planted on the deck of your scooter and keep your front wheel straight when you land your bunny hop. Start riding on your scooter at a comfortable speed and do a bunnyhop, keeping your scooter level. As you reach the highest point of the hop, use the hand movement you practiced to spin the bars around and catch them again.  Hold on tightly to the handlebars and bend your knees slightly as you land to give you more control over the scooter when you‚Äôre back on the ground. If you‚Äôre worried about crashing, you can practice on a softer surface like grass first. You don‚Äôt need to be moving to do this, just practice jumping and spinning the bar until you‚Äôre ready to try it while moving. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to perform a barspin on a scooter. It begins by describing how to stand on the scooter and spin the handlebars using your dominant hand. Tips to keep the scooter still while practicing, such as placing the back wheel against a wall, are also given. The article then moves on to practicing the barspin while the scooter is moving. The importance of learning the bunny hop trick and the level of control it provides is emphasized. The higher the jump, the more time there is to spin the handlebars and regain control. Lastly, the article mentions the importance of solid landing, controlling the scooter when back on the ground, and suggests practicing on softer surfaces like grass to prevent injuries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Erin was always scared to use a public toilet unlike Cynthia because","output":"Cynthia was fearless. It was an odd fear for Erin to have, but it plagued her throughout her entire life ‚Äì the fear of public restrooms. It began when she was just five years old. She had walked into a public restroom with her mother and unknowingly stepped on a piece of gum. Her mother's angry scolding left her scarred and anxious, associating public restrooms with a sense of danger and contamination. Years passed and Erin tried her best to work through her fear. She always tried to schedule outings with breaks built in, so she could return to her safe home bathroom. Despite her quirks, Erin managed to build a strong bond with Cynthia during their college years. Cynthia, on the other hand, had an uncanny ability to adapt to any surrounding ‚Äì from the most pristine of restrooms to the dingiest of public stalls. She had a certain level of confidence that Erin had always admired, and she hoped that some of it would rub off on her. One day, Cynthia invited Erin to the annual cultural fair held downtown. It was an event filled with music, dance, food, and craft stalls ‚Äì an atmosphere Cynthia loved and knew Erin would enjoy too. Despite the excitement in her heart, Erin's mind began to panic: how would she manage to avoid the dreaded public restrooms with all the food and drink available? Despite her concerns, Erin took a deep breath and decided to say yes to her friend's invitation. She couldn't let this fear control her life. On the day of the fair, they set off early in the morning, the sun shining brightly and the smell of delicious food wafting through the air. Cynthia sensed Erin's anxiety but was determined to help her friend conquer her fears. As the day went by, the two friends had a great time exploring numerous stalls, trying various dishes, and dancing together. However, as fate would have it, nature called. Erin felt the familiar pang of panic rise in her chest. Seeing the look on her friend's face, Cynthia understood what was going on.  Cynthia took Erin's hand and led her to the public restroom area. \\"Erin, listen to me. I know you're scared, and that's okay. But I'll be right here with you, and I'll make sure nothing goes wrong. You have to face this fear and realize that it's only a part of your mind playing tricks on you. Are you with me?\\" With Cynthia's unwavering support, Erin found herself breathing more easily. Steeling her resolve, she nodded. \\"Okay, I'm with you. Let's do this.\\" Hand in hand, they approached the restrooms. The old fear began to creep up on Erin, but Cynthia continued to encourage her. With every step, Erin became stronger, more determined to defeat her fear. Once they reached the entrance, Cynthia squeezed Erin's hand and smiled. \\"You're not alone, remember that.\\" Erin walked into the restroom, feeling her heartbeat quicken. The echo of footsteps and the sound of running water were all she could hear. In a distant corner, she noticed a cleaning cart ‚Äì a sign that the place had been recently cleaned. As she entered a stall and locked the door, she tried to concentrate on her breathing. A few minutes later, her task was finally done. When Erin exited the restroom, she was greeted with a big smile and a hug from Cynthia. \\"I'm proud of you. You faced your fear, and you're still standing.\\" While their adventure at the cultural fair continued, Erin felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Indeed, she was still standing after facing her biggest fear. As they walked hand in hand towards the next exciting exhibit at the fair, Erin couldn't help but feel more vibrant and alive than ever. Erin's journey to overcome her fear of public restrooms wasn't an easy one, but with the help of her friend Cynthia and the strength she found within herself, she took a significant step forward.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Ever since Canadian psychiatrist Michael R. Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further.

Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland. The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. There was also an important Jewish community in Bristol from the late 12th century through to the late 13th century when all Jews were expelled from England. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348‚Äì49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.

The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter   passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically   switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers  normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat. \\"It is possible, but it would be a lot of effort,\\" she says. \\"That was one of my main design considerations.\\" Options: A They control a child's evening TV viewing time. B They determine a child's daily pocket money. C They have raised the hot issue of overweight. D They contain information of the receiver. Answer: A They control a child's evening TV viewing time.

Given the question: Information:  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381¬†billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Salyut 5 (meaning \\"Salute 5\\"), also known as OPS-3, was a Soviet space station. Launched in 1976 as part of the Salyut programme, it was the third and last Almaz space station to be launched for the Soviet military. Two Soyuz missions visited the station, each manned by two cosmonauts. A third Soyuz mission attempted to visit the station, but failed to dock, whilst a fourth mission was planned but never launched.  - Vitaly Mikhaylovich Zholobov (born 18 June 1937) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut who flew on Soyuz 21 space flight as the flight engineer.  - Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement.  - The Almaz (\\"Diamond\\") program was a highly secretive Soviet military space station program, begun in the early 1960s.  - Mir (; lit.¬†\\"peace\\" or \\"world\\") was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, run by the Soviet Union and later by Russia. \\"Mir\\" was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986¬†to¬†1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station after Mir's orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.  - The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the largest artificial body in orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.  - Tiangong-2 is a Chinese space laboratory and part of the Project 921-2 space station program. Tiangong-2 was launched on 15 September 2016, 22:04:09 (UTC+8).  - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes). Objects below approximately will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss.  - Soyuz 5 (\\"Union 5\\") was a Soyuz mission using the Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union on 15 January 1969, which docked with Soyuz 4 in orbit. It was the first-ever docking of two manned spacecraft of any nation, and the first-ever transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another of any nation, the only time a transfer was accomplished with a space walk  two months before the US Apollo 9 mission performed the first ever internal crew transfer.  - Tiangong-1 is China's first prototype space station, serving as both a manned laboratory and an experimental testbed to demonstrate orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities.  Launched unmanned aboard a Long March 2F/G rocket on 29 September 2011, it is the first operational component of the Tiangong program, which aims to place a larger, modular station into orbit by 2023. Tiangong-1 was initially projected to be deorbited in 2013, to be replaced over the following decade by the larger Tiangong-2 and Tiangong-3 modules, but as of October 2016 it was still aloft, though in a decaying orbit.  - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.  - Boris Valentinovich Volynov (born 18 December 1934) is a Soviet cosmonaut who flew two space missions of the Soyuz programme: Soyuz 5, and Soyuz 21. He was the first halakhic (by mother) Jewish cosmonaut.  - The Soyuz programme (or  meaning \\"Union\\") is a human spaceflight programme that was initiated by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, originally part of a Moon landing project intended to put a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. It was the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the Vostok and Voskhod programme.  - Landing is the last part of a flight, where a flying animal, aircraft, or spacecraft returns to the ground. When the flying object returns to water, the process is called alighting, although it is commonly called \\"landing,\\" \\"touchdown\\" or \\"splashdown\\" as well. A normal aircraft flight would include several parts of flight including taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent and landing.  - A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station. three space stations are in orbit: the International Space Station, which is permanently manned, China's Tiangong-1 (defunct) and Tiangong-2 (launched 15 September 2016, not permanently manned). Previous stations include the Almaz and Salyut series, Skylab, and most recently \\"Mir\\".  - Soyuz 21 ( Russian :  21 , Union 21 ) was a 1976 Soviet manned mission to the Salyut 5 space station , the first of three flights to the station . The mission 's objectives were mainly military in scope , but included other scientific work . The mission ended abruptly with cosmonauts Boris Volynov and Vitaly Zholobov returning to earth after 49 days in orbit . The precise reason for the early end of the mission was the subject of much speculation , but was reported to be an emergency evacuation after the Salyut atmosphere developed an acrid odor .  - Skylab was the United States' first space station, orbiting Earth from 1973 to 1979, when it fell back to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention. Launched and operated by NASA, Skylab included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments. It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of . Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (which was famous for carrying the manned Moon landing missions). Skylab was not simply a place of habitation; it was a place of massive science experiments for which when the bulk of data was returned, such as on films that had to be physically returned to Earth began the process of analyzing scientific and engineering data as each mission was completed. Skylab's solar observatory was one major aspect of study, and solar science was significantly advanced by the telescope; it observed the Sun as it never before. As Skylab finished up NASA's focus had shifted to development of the Space Shuttle, which had the promise of reducing the cost of space access compared to the previous launch systems    What object entity has the relation of 'part of' with the subject 'soyuz 21'?

Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally. For the album's release, U2 partnered with Apple for several cross-promotions: the first single, \\"Vertigo\\", was featured in a television advertisement for the company's iPod music player, while a U2-branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released. \\"Vertigo\\" was an international hit, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK, while reaching number two in Canada, number five in Australia, and number 31 in the US.

He served as the governor from 1779 to 1781. During his term as governor, he faced several challenges, including invasions by the British. He was also pivotal in leading the effort of moving the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond. Despite the contemporaneous difficulty, which later led to a political investigation, Jefferson managed to accomplish noteworthy societal reforms throughout his governorship. These included the abolishment of entail and primogeniture - inheritance laws that deeply favored the gentry - and the relaxation of naturalization laws to promote immigration.  Thomas Jefferson's governorship preceded his presidency. After his term as governor, he went on to serve as U.S. minister to France before eventually becoming the third President of the United States. Notably, during his presidency, he authorized the famous Louisiana Purchase, which significantly expanded the territory of the United States.  His influence and popularity were such that a newly-formed county in Kentucky chose to name it after him in 1780, a true testament to his long-standing impact on the nation.

A:","output":"Step 1: Identify the period of time when the steam engine was initially introduced in the English empire. Justification: Knowing the timeframe will help us better understand the context of the question and will allow us to focus on the relevant industry or commodity in that period. Step 2: Research the industries prevalent during the initial period of the steam engine's introduction.  Justification: Gaining knowledge of the industries in that time period will help us narrow down the possible commodities that may have benefited from the steam engine. Step 3: Analyze the impact of the steam engine on these industries, focusing on which industry experienced the most significant growth or change as a result of the steam engine. Justification: The industry that saw the most growth or change will likely be the one that benefited the most from the steam engine during its initial introduction. Step 4: Identify the primary commodity produced by this industry.  Justification: Understanding the most significant product of the industry will help us provide a specific answer to the user's question. So, based on these steps: Step 1: The steam engine was initially introduced in the English empire in the early 18th century, with key inventions made by Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, and later improved by James Watt in the 1760s and 1770s. Step 2: The main industries during this period were textile, mining, iron, and agriculture. Step 3: The steam engine had a significant impact on many industries, but the mining and textile industries saw the greatest benefits during the initial period. The steam engine allowed for greater productivity and efficiency by pumping water out of mines, and the textile industry benefited from spinning and weaving machines powered by steam engines. Step 4: The primary commodity produced by the mining industry was coal, and the primary commodity produced by the textile industry was cotton. Conclusion: The commodity that benefited most by the steam engine initially in the English empire was coal. Coal was the primary commodity produced in the mining industry, which saw significant improvements in efficiency and productivity due to the introduction of the steam engine for pumping water out of mines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The ceremony was attended by Lennon's son Julian and his first wife Cynthia in a park overlooking the River Mersey in this northwest English city, where the singer-songwriter and his fellow Beatles launched their careers.      \\"We come here with our hearts to honour Dad and to pray for peace and say 'thank you' to each and every one of you, and everybody involved in the celebrations today,\\" said Julian Lennon, 47.      His 71-year-old mother Cynthia, who met Lennon at Liverpool Art College, added that people should not mourn him but should enjoy his life.      \\"Don't be morbid, enjoy the joy that he had and what we all have from his music,\\" she told the crowd of dignitaries and fans from all over the world who gathered in the city's Chavasse Park for the unveiling ceremony.      It was one of a number of events planned worldwide to celebrate Lennon's birthday and his legacy, 30 years after he was shot dead outside his Manhattan apartment in December 1980.      His widow, Yoko Ono, took part in celebrations in Iceland -- even though she admitted Lennon had never liked to mark the progress of time.      \\"The last birthday, he told me: 'I can't quite believe I'm going to be 40'. I don't think he liked that part,\\" she said in an interview published in The Times newspaper Saturday.      \\"I don't think of him as 70. He was always that sort of strutting around, very, very energetic guy, and to me he's still like that,\\" she continued, adding: \\"I think he would have aged well, he had a good bone structure.\\"      The 77-year-old was due to light up the \\"Imagine Peace Tower\\" in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik later Saturday, before performing with her Ono Plastic Band and her son Sean Lennon at an evening concert in the capital.      The tower, a three-year-old art installation composed of a strong, vertical beam of light which can reach up to 4,000 meters (13,100 feet), is lit up every year and stays lit until December 8, the anniversary of his death.      Organisers of the Liverpool monument hope their new sculpture can provide an alternative base for Lennon's fans.      Designed by US artist Lauren Voiers and commissioned by a US arts organisation, the Global Peace Initiative, it comprises a globe with multicoloured symbols of peace and musical references swirled above it.      There are two hands outstretched to the sky, doves of peace, a keyboard and a white feather, which Julian Lennon said was a symbol of his father's spirit.      \\"One of the things my father said to me was that should he pass away, if there was some way of letting me know he was going to be OK, it was by, in some shape or form, presenting me with a white feather,\\" he said.      Asked how her husband would have faced the modern world today, Yoko Ono said he would have loved computers and would have used them to make music and communicate around the world.      Lennon would also have remained a peace activist, she said: \\"He would have been very, very angry that violence and war are still going on.\\"      Copyright ¬© 2010 AFP. All rights reserved.

Information:  - In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011.  - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\".  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee.  - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\".  - A genus (¬†genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee.  - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.  - In biological classification , rank is the relative level of a group of organisms ( a taxon ) in a taxonomic hierarchy . Examples of taxonomic ranks are species , genus , family , class , kingdom , etc. A given rank subsumes under it less general categories , that is , more specific descriptions of life forms . Above it , each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors . The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic ; which means that to identify a particular organism , it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two . Consider a particular species , the red fox Vulpes vulpes : its next rank , the genus Vulpes , comprises all the ' true foxes ' . Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank , the family Canidae , which includes dogs , wolves , jackals , all foxes , and other caniforms ; the next higher rank , the order Carnivora , includes feliforms and caniforms ( lions , tigers , bears , hyenas , wolverines , and all those mentioned above ) , plus other carnivorous mammals . As one group of the class Mammalia , all of the above are classified among those with backbones in the Chordata phylum rank , and with them among all the animals in the Animalia kingdom rank . Finally , all of the above will find their earliest relatives somewhere in their domain rank Eukarya . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as : The level , for nomenclatural purposes , of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy ( e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank , which lies between superfamily and subfamily )  - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: ,  - \\"phyl√©\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race +  - \\"genetik√≥s\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree)  a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes.  - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.  - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants.  - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.  - Nomenclature codes or codes of nomenclature are the various rulebooks that govern biological taxonomic nomenclature, each in their own broad field of organisms. To an end-user who only deals with names of species, with some awareness that species are assignable to families, it may not be noticeable that there is more than one code, but beyond this basic level these are rather different in the way they work.  - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct).  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.    What is the relationship between 'taxonomic rank' and 'taxonomy'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Taxonomic rank and taxonomy are related concepts in the field of biological classification. Taxonomy is the scientific discipline concerned with the identification, naming, and classification of living organisms into distinct groups based on their shared characteristics. Taxonomic rank, on the other hand, refers to the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) within the hierarchical structure of the classification system. In taxonomy, various taxonomic ranks are used to categorize organisms, such as species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom. Each rank represents a more inclusive and broader grouping than the one below it. For example, a species represents a group of similar individuals, while a genus includes multiple closely related species. As taxa are classified based on their evolutionary relationships, taxonomic ranks help to reflect the degrees of similarity and differences among organisms. In summary, taxonomy is the overall process and system of classifying and organizing living organisms, while taxonomic rank represents the hierarchical levels within that system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: As soon as you notice a jam beginning to form, stop the shredder to keep things from getting any worse. This gives you a chance to slow down, assess the situation and prepare to fix the jam. Jamming signs to be watchful for include a slowing down of the paper moving through the shredder, an outright stop, and a whirring, \\"straining\\" noise that should be readily obvious. One reason that shredders sometimes jam is that there isn't anywhere for the paper to go once it is shredded because the wastebasket is full. If your wastebasket is full, try emptying it and re-trying which may be enough to resolve your jam. If the jam still won't clear, proceed to the following steps. Because jamming is a common problem, most modern shredders come with a built-in option to run in reverse. Switch the shredder to its \\"reverse\\" option (usually there is a well-marked button on the top of the shredder) before plugging it back in. Ensure your fingers or any other tools are not near the shredder opening when you plug it in. Reversing the shredder will usually clear a minor jam in a matter of seconds. However, in especially bad cases, the shredder may jam again when it runs in reverse. In this case, unplug the shredder again, switch it to \\"auto\\" or \\"forward\\" (the precise option may vary on your shredder) and plug it back in. Be prepared to alternate between auto and reverse as needed. A jam that's bad enough to gum up your shredder when it runs in reverse may be bad enough to jam it yet again when it runs forward for the second time. However, by switching between forward and reverse, it's almost always possible to gradually work your paper out of a jammed shredder. One of the most common reasons for a shredder jam is simply that too much paper was fed into the shredder at once. Once you clear your jam, try shredding a smaller amount of paper if this was the cause for the jam, the smaller second load should pass through with less difficulty. If you still can't seem to get your jam to clear after alternating between reverse and auto/forward, you may have an extra-severe jam that needs to be cleared manually. Never fear, consult the section below for further help.","output":"The passage provides steps for clearing a paper jam in a shredder. The first signs of a jam might include slowing down of paper movement, an outright stop, or straining noises. The cause of the jam could be an overfilled wastebasket or overfeeding of paper. The initial resolution steps involve stopping the shredding, assessing the situation, emptying the wastebasket if full, and retrying. If unsuccessful, the built-in reversing function can be used to clear minor jams. If the jam recurs even in reverse mode, alternating between auto/forward and reverse modes might work. Reducing the quantity of paper shredded at once can help avoid future jams.

I recommend 10 Minute Solution: Pilates because you will feel the same burn with less maneuvering. There is not really a difference in the challenge level between the two DVDs. Regarding the workout on this DVD, there are new moves I haven't tried before, but I had no difficulty doing them.

Write an article that answers the following question: how many points did marshall gain?","output":"Title: Decoding Marshall's Points Gain: An In-Depth Analysis Introduction The question \\"How many points did Marshall gain?\\" requires some context to provide an accurate and comprehensive answer. Since Marshall is a fairly common name, we must first identify which Marshall we are discussing: a sports player, a character from a story or TV show, or any other context in which points are involved. In this article, we will explore several scenarios in which a person named Marshall could potentially gain points and provide an in-depth analysis of each situation. Scenario 1: Marshall Faulk, American Football Player Marshall Faulk is a former American football player who played in the NFL as a running back for the Indianapolis Colts and the St. Louis Rams. He is widely regarded as one of the best running backs in the league's history. To determine Faulk's points gain, we would need to review his career statistics and calculate the number of touchdowns he scored. In his career, Faulk had 136 total touchdowns, including 100 rushing, 36 receiving touchdowns, and 2 punt returns. In American football, a touchdown is worth six points. Hence, Marshall Faulk gained a total of 816 points (136 touchdowns x 6). Scenario 2: Marshall Eriksen, Fictional Character from \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" Marshall Eriksen is a fictional character from the popular TV show \\"How I Met Your Mother.\\" Though there isn't a specific \\"points system\\" in the show for the characters, we can examine a pivotal moment in one of the show's episodes where Marshall takes part in a drinking game called \\"Edward Forty-Hands.\\" In this game, a person has two 40-ounce bottles taped to their hands and must finish them to win. While there is no exact points system for this game, we can consider Marshall's gain as a successful completion of the challenge and award him an arbitrary 1 point for his achievement. Scenario 3: Marshall Lee, Character from \\"Adventure Time\\" Marshall Lee is a fictional character from the animated TV show \\"Adventure Time.\\" He is the gender-swapped version of the character Marceline, a vampire queen, and a bass-playing musician. There is no established points system for this character in the series. However, if we were to create a point system for the musical performances of Marshall Lee, we could analyze his singing and playing skills in various episodes and assign points accordingly based on an adopted rating scheme (e.g., quality, style, voice, and melody). For this scenario, we would need to devise a clear evaluation system and review each individual performance to determine his points gain accurately. Conclusion The question \\"How many points did Marshall gain?\\" cannot be answered without proper context. As we explored various scenarios with characters named Marshall, we observed different points systems in each situation. Additionally, several contexts may not have any established point systems, requiring the creation of an evaluation method to determine their points gain. In conclusion, to answer this question accurately and comprehensively, the context surrounding Marshall and the point system must first be identified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary √âtude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary √âtude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it. Now answer this question: What is the only piece Chopin gave an actual title to?","output":"The only piece that Chopin gave an actual title to is the Funeral March, which is the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: \\"How do I handle a verbal fight in the work place (it just happened), knowing this person will mark me as an 'enemy' and I will probably meet this person in the same 'work community' later?\\" Second question: How do I know a long distance relationship will work in person? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choose from: * no. * yes.","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address different situations and require separate responses. First question: \\"How do I handle a verbal fight in the workplace (it just happened), knowing this person will mark me as an 'enemy' and I will probably meet this person in the same 'work community' later?\\" To handle a verbal fight in the workplace, follow these steps: 1. Find a safe space to cool down: After the argument, it's essential to distance yourself from the person involved and calm your emotions to think objectively about the situation. 2. Reflect on the conflict: Spend some time considering what led to the fight and analyze your emotions, reactions, and the words exchanged. 3. Seek advice from a trusted colleague or mentor: Discuss the situation with someone who understands the dynamics of your workplace and can provide guidance and insight. 4. Apologize if necessary: If you find that you were responsible for the escalation, an apology to the other person involved can go a long way in mending the relationship. 5. Talk to your supervisor or HR: If the conflict affects your ability to work effectively, it's essential to have a discussion with your supervisor or HR to mediate the situation. 6. Develop a plan to improve communication: To prevent future conflicts, take the initiative to establish better communication methods with the person involved and maintain a professional demeanor. 7. Practice active listening: When in meetings or interactions with this person, focus on truly understanding their perspective and ask questions for clarity instead of reacting defensively. 8. Maintain a positive attitude: Try not to let the conflict affect your work or your relationships with other colleagues. Be cooperative and stay focused on your tasks. Second question: \\"How do I know a long distance relationship will work in person?\\" Determining whether a long distance relationship will work in person can be challenging, but you can look for the following signs: 1. Strong communication: If you and your partner have maintained regular, open, and honest communication during your long-distance relationship, it's a good sign that you two can work well in person. 2. Similar values and expectations: Ensure both of you have shared values and expectations regarding your relationship, future goals, and personal boundaries. 3. Trust and support: A strong foundation of trust and willingness to support each other emotionally, and in your individual pursuits, indicate that your relationship may thrive when you're physically together. 4. Conflict resolution skills: Every relationship experiences disagreements, but if you and your partner can resolve conflicts respectfully and constructively even from afar, it bodes well for your relationship in person. 5. Shared vision of the future: Discuss your long-term personal and relationship goals, and make sure you're both on the same page about where you see yourselves in the future. 6. Enjoy each other's company: During your virtual or in-person interactions, pay attention to how much you enjoy spending time with your partner. High levels of positive engagement usually mean that your relationship will continue to be enjoyable when you're together. 7. Plan visits: Schedule in-person visits whenever possible, as spending physical time together will allow you both to get a better sense of how your relationship performs in person. 8. Follow your instincts: Trust your intuition and listen to what your gut is telling you about the relationship. If you feel a strong connection and believe that you can make it work in person, chances are you're right. In conclusion, although these two questions address different situations, they both have underlying themes of communication, trust, and relationship building."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

Article: Many animal and plant species have become extinct and many more are in critical danger. Finding ways to protect the earth's wildlife and conserve the natural world they inhabit is now more important than ever.  Dodo The Dodo is a classic example of how human caused damage to the earth's biology. The flightless Dodo was native to the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It lived off fruit fallen from the island's trees and lived unthreatened until humans arrived in 1505. The easily controlled bird became a source of food for sailors and was attacked by animals introduced to the island by humans such as pigs, monkeys and rats. The population of Dodos rapidly decreased and last one was killed in 1681.  Rhinos The Rhino horn is a highly priced item for Asian medicine. This has led to the animal being hunted in its natural habitat. Once widespread in Africa and Eurasia, most rhinos now live in protected natural parks and reserves . Their numbers have rapidly decreased in the last 50 years, and the animals remain under constant threat from poachers .  The Giant Panda The future of the World Wildlife Fund's symbol is far from certain. As few as 1000 remain in the wild. The Chinese government has set up 33 panda reserves to protect these beautiful animals and made poaching them punishable with 20 years in prison.

Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review provided is negative in nature. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the work being reviewed, suggesting that the author, Morris, manipulates the facts in order to support their argument. Additionally, the reviewer recommends an alternative resource, John Larson's \\"Summer for the Gods,\\" as a more evenhanded account, implying that the work by Morris is not balanced or fair in its representation of the subject matter. There are several key elements in the review that indicate its negative tone: 1. The use of the term \\"very slanted\\" in the title suggests a strong bias in the work reviewed, indicating that it does not present a well-rounded, objective view of the topic. 2. The phrase \\"Morris, as ever, twists the facts around to make his case\\" implies that the author has a history of manipulating information to pursue their agenda, which is a negative criticism of their writing and argumentative style. 3. The statement \\"it doesn't hold together\\" indicates that the reviewer believes the work's overall argument is weak and lacks coherence. 4. The comparison of the work to John Larson's \\"Summer for the Gods\\" highlights the reviewer's preference for what they perceive as a more balanced and well-researched alternative. The mention of the Pulitzer Prize-winning status of the alternative work aims to further emphasize the reviewer's dissatisfaction with Morris's work and bolster the credibility of their criticism.

His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil G√≥nzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala.

Information:  - Piracetam (sold under many brand names) is a nootropic drug in the racetams group, with chemical name \\"2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide\\". It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid). Presently piracetam is used in many European countries, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear.  - Levetiracetam, marketed under the trade name Keppra among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial onset, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam.  - Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, brand names Phenotropil, Carphedon), also called is a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects.  - Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that anticonvulsants themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated \\"AEDs\\"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy.  - Etiracetam is a chemical compound belonging to the racetam family, which was developed as a nootropic drug. It is racemic; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam, now marketed as an antiepileptic drug.  - Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects. Due to their rendering a characteristic \\"up\\" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as \\"uppers\\". Depressants or \\"downers\\", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be the functionally opposite drug class. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and amphetamine. It is estimated that the percent of the population that has abused amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA combined is between .8% and 2.1%.  - Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behaviour. It gives the reasons for people's actions, desires, and needs. Motivation can also be defined as one's direction to behavior, or what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior and vice versa. A motive is what prompts the person to act in a certain way, or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior. According to Maehr and Meyer, \\"Motivation is a word that is part of the popular culture as few other psychological concepts are.\\"  - Nootropicsalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersare drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses, among others. Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly.  - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery.  - Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed. As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2013 it resulted in 116,000 deaths up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the...  - A drug is any substance (other than food that provides nutritional support) that, when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed, absorbed via a patch on the skin, or dissolved under the tongue, causes a physiological change in the body.  - Oxiracetam (ISF 2522) is a nootropic drug of the racetam family and very mild stimulant. Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States.  - Executive functions (collectively referred to as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes  including attentional control, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as reasoning, problem solving, and planning  that are necessary for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual. Neuropsychological tests are used to measure executive functions, and are usually performed as part of a more comprehensive assessment to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders.  - Racetams are a class of drugs that share a pyrrolidone nucleus. Some, such as piracetam, are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants.  - Etiracetam is a nootropic drug of the racetam family . It is racemic ; its biologically active enantiomeric form is levetiracetam .  - Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam (trade name Keppra). It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted.  - In chemistry, an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). Organic compounds that contain a chiral carbon atom usually have two non-superposable structures. These two structures are mirror images of each other and are, thus, commonly called enantiomorphs (\\"enantio\\" = opposite ; \\"morph\\" = form), hence this structural property is now commonly referred to as enantiomerism.

Summarize this article: Camp residents and aid workers were among those killed when the air force bombed Rann, in Borno state, thinking it was a base of Boko Haram militants. It was the biggest known botched attack in eight years of fighting the group. The Nigerian army says it is engaged in a \\"final push\\" against the Islamists. Commanders have apologised for the \\"accidental\\" bombing, which they said was because of \\"the fog of war\\". Human Rights Watch said this did not absolve them of responsibility, and called for compensation for the victims. A local government official from the area, Babagana Malarima, said a mistake had been made when it was earlier reported that the number of those killed had risen to 236. The error had been made by those in the camp settlement who had added the number of dead to the number of injured to come up with the figure, he told the BBC. In the immediate aftermath of the attack last Tuesday, the medical charity MSF said 52 people had died. The wounded were treated in an MSF tented clinic as there are no hospitals in Rann, where displaced people are living in makeshift shelters. An aid worker told the BBC that the attack, in which at least two bombs were dropped, caused terror and chaos at the camp. He said he saw dead children lying on the ground, others left as orphans and terrible injuries among survivors. Aid workers estimated 20,000-40,000 people had been sheltering in Rann, near the border with Cameroon, after fleeing attacks by Boko Haram. The emergency services official, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said all those who had died at Rann had now been buried. Those critically injured were still receiving treatment in the state capital, Maiduguri, while others were being treated locally by international aid agencies and local services. The Red Cross has said it has distributed food to more than 25,000 people in Rann since Saturday. It said they had received enough rice, beans, oil, salt and corn soya blend to last for five weeks. \\"People in Rann were happy to receive food. They have been isolated by rains and poor quality roads since June and running very low on food supplies,\\" said Red Cross economic security coordinator Mohammed Sheikh-Ali. \\"At the beginning of January, we laid sand bags on the road for our trucks to be able to cross. We got 12 trucks full of food to Rann last week on the day of the air strike, which prevented us [from distributing].

Write a text based on this summary: study links late cancer diagnosis with lack of insurance Text:","output":"Title: Uninsured Individuals at Greater Risk for Late Cancer Diagnosis, Study Finds A recent study has revealed a concerning correlation between the lack of insurance and late cancer diagnosis, highlighting the importance of accessible healthcare for early detection and treatment. According to the study published in [name of journal], researchers found that individuals without insurance are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage, compared to those who are insured. This concerning finding underscores the critical role health insurance plays in enabling timely cancer screening and detection. The study analyzed data from thousands of patients with various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer, among others. Through meticulous examination, researchers were able to identify a clear trend: patients without insurance were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, thus reducing their chances of successful treatment and survival. There are several reasons for this unfortunate correlation. Uninsured individuals often experience financial barriers that prevent them from accessing routine healthcare, which may include crucial cancer screening and early detection tests. Additionally, the lack of insurance may cause individuals to delay seeking medical attention for symptoms until they become severe, further complicating the chances for timely diagnosis and treatment. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of addressing the issue of unequal healthcare access and encouraging the implementation of affordable insurance options. Ensuring that everyone has access to early cancer screening and detection services can greatly reduce the number of late-stage cancer diagnoses and ultimately improve overall survival rates. In conclusion, the study linking late cancer diagnosis to the lack of insurance highlights the urgent need for accessible and affordable healthcare options for all individuals. Ensuring that everyone has the necessary insurance coverage to access vital cancer screening and early detection services can make a significant difference in timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and overall cancer survival rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Disabling a car alarm can be a temporary fix before seeking professional auto assistance. However, keep in mind, car alarms are meant to be anti-theft, and when tampered with, some systems prevent a vehicle from starting as a security measure. Alarm systems consist of a few components.  Control unit. This part is often referred to as the brain because it functions as the command center for the system. Alarm transmitter. This comes in two forms: key-chain remote or the key. Sensors. Alarms vary and can get complex with various sensors such as pressure, door, or window sensors. Siren. Alarms need some type of warning signal; some systems have their own siren component while others are wired to car stereo. Wires. Wires connect the siren to the control unit, the control unit to the fuses, and the control unit to the sensors. Open up the hood and locate the battery. Using a socket wrench, unscrew the negative terminal (-) of the battery and pull it off. This is a safety measure; messing around with a vehicle's electronics can be dangerous. If you have a factory car alarm, check in your owner‚Äôs manual as a guide. The alarm system is usually under the hood near the steering wheel. If you have an after-market car alarm, it may be installed in any part of the car, but companies usually install them under the steering wheel. Some alarm control units have labels for each wire. Removing the wires attached to the control unit and removing the wires attached to the siren are two ways to disable and silence your alarm.  Pull the wire of the siren. This will silence the alarm and might be a good temporary fix before seeking professional assistance. Remove the control unit. If you pull out the brain, there will be no alarm in the car. However, depending on the way your car alarm was set up, this might disable your vehicle from starting. After you pull a wire, plug the battery back in to make sure the alarm isn't going off again. Turn on your car and give the engine a rev. You want to make sure the car can still function.","output":"This article provides a guide on temporarily disabling a car alarm by disconnecting the negative terminal of the battery, locating the alarm control unit, and removing wires from the siren or control unit before seeking professional auto assistance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mary Youngblood plays a type of flute that is held in front of the player, and has what type of finger holes? The answer to this question is:","output":"Mary Youngblood is renowned for her skills in playing the Native American Flute, which like many traditional and ethnic flutes, is held in front of the player. This type of flute is a woodwind instrument and is embedded within the cultural and spiritual traditions of Native American tribes. The Native American flute typically has finger holes that are open and essentially free of keys or pads which are commonly found on flutes like the Western concert flute. The specific number of the finger holes can vary depending on the particular design of the flute, but in general, they typically have either five or six finger holes. Most traditionally, a six-hole Native American Flute would have five holes arranged in a line and a sixth hole under the first for the thumb or positioned slightly off from the line of the first five. The instrument can create different pitches based on covering different combinations of the finger holes while playing. Unlike modern flutes which have a system of keys to cover the holes, Native American flutes require the musician's fingers to cover the holes directly. It's part of what gives the flute its distinct, hauntingly beautiful sound, as the musician can subtly alter the pitch and tone depending on the exact placement and pressure of their fingers on every hole. To answer your question directly, Mary Youngblood plays a type of flute (the Native American Flute) that is held in front of the player and has open finger holes.

Gay returns home from the office to find the beautiful Helen Reed (Wendy Barrie) waiting to see him. Helen is the secretary of Wood and on her employer's behalf invites The Falcon to the same party Elinor wanted him to go to. She goes on to explain that some of Wood's parties have been plagued by jewel thefts and Maxine is particularly concerned about a diamond owned by Mrs Vera Gardner (Lucile Gleason) one of the guests. Unable to resist Gay accompanies Elinor to the party while instructing Goldie to infiltrate the event too.However, Elinor becomes angry when she realises why Gay changed his mind about attending the party and retaliates by dancing with one of the other guests Manuel Retana (Turhan Bey). In frustration, she grabs the flower from Retana's lapel and flings it at Gay. He calmly picks it up and attaches it to his lapel. Gardner then insists on dancing with Gay and while they are dancing she hands him her diamond secretly. Her action puzzles Gay greatly but before he can ask her about it she leaves the room. Moments later, a shot rings out, and she falls to the floor dead. The killer is seen by Goldie as he makes his getaway. Unfortunately, when the police arrive Detectives Bates (Edward Brophy) and Grimes (Eddie Dunn) arrest Goldie as a material witness as he was the only person in the room where Mrs Gardner was killed. Gay follows Goldie to the police station where he speaks to Inspector Mike Waldeck (Arthur Shields)...","output":"Based on the movie plot of The Gay Falcon, Gay Laurence (The Falcon) suspects that Gardner arranged to have her diamonds \\"stolen\\" because of her unusual behavior during the party. When Gardner dances with Gay, she secretly hands him her diamond, an action that puzzles Gay greatly. This act might suggest that Mrs. Gardner is planning an insurance scam by passing her valuable diamonds to Gay, then potentially staging their theft in order to make an insurance claim. There is also a connection to the larger insurance scam plot, where some of Maxine Wood's parties have been plagued by jewel thefts. Considering the premise of the film revolves around stopping crooks from running an insurance scam, it is reasonable to suspect that Gardner was involved.

MK Dons could have gone ahead in first-half injury time when Paul Konchesky brought down Kieran Agard just inside the Gillingham box, but Stuart Nelson - who had dived the other way - managed to save Dean Bowditch's penalty with his trailing foot. The Gills came out stronger in the second half and their dominance led to a 64th-minute breakthrough as a Dack cross from deep picked out the unmarked McDonald, who headed in his fifth league goal this season.

Scientists count about 50 hot spots on the Earth. Hot spots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate. Hot spots lie directly above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume . Mantle plumes continuously bring magma up from the mantle towards the crust ( Figure below ).   Q: What substance comes toward earth's crust through mantle plumes?   Choices:  - rocks  - water  - gas  - magma  A: The answer is:","output":"magma. Magma is the substance that comes towards the Earth's crust through mantle plumes. To understand this process, it's essential to dive into the concepts of mantle plumes, hot spots, and volcanoes. Mantle plumes are columns of hot, partially molten rock that rise from deep within the Earth's mantle. They can extend for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers and are thought to originate near the boundary between the Earth's core and the mantle. Mantle plumes are thought to be the source of \\"hot spots,\\" which are regions of increased volcanic activity. Hot spots, as mentioned in the paragraph, are found across the Earth's surface and can occur in the middle of a tectonic plate or along the boundaries between plates. There are approximately 50 hot spots identified around the world, and they are regions where mantle plumes are gradually providing magma to the layer just below the Earth's surface. This increased volcanic activity is often accompanied by the formation of volcanoes. Volcanoes are landforms that form as a result of volcanic processes, such as the movement of magma through the Earth's crust and subsequent eruptions. These eruptions release hot gases, ash, and molten rock called lava. Magma, the molten rock material originating from deep below the Earth's surface, serves as the primary substance moving through mantle plumes toward the Earth's crust. Mantle plumes play a crucial role in providing continuous magma from the mantle towards the Earth's crust. This supply of magma enables the formation of volcanoes and the generation of volcanic hot spots, making these geological processes interconnected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Good Mental Health Away From Home Starts Before College When Eliza Lanzillo went off to college, she was excited to leave behind her old school, her old routines‚Äîand her old mental health challenges. ‚ÄúI thought of it as a clean slate. Nobody knows my history. I could be a new person,‚Äù says the now 21-year-old junior at Brown University. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want people to see me as the girl with anorexia.‚Äù Ms. Lanzillo started struggling with the eating disorder and anxiety in high school. She had been doing so well the summer before college that she stopped therapy when she arrived for college in Providence, R.I. But a few months into her first semester, she relapsed. With high school seniors now deciding where they‚Äôll be attending college in the fall, now is the time, psychologists and psychiatrists say, for teens and their parents to focus on how to maintain good mental health away from home. This is particularly vital for the growing number of teenagers who have already struggled with mental illness in high school. About 14.3% of college students were diagnosed with or treated for anxiety problems during the past year, and 12% were diagnosed with or treated for depression, according to a spring 2014 survey of 79,266 college students by the American College Health Association. That is up from 10.4% for anxiety and 10.2% for depression in the fall 2008 survey. Anxiety and depression are the most common disorders, according to the survey. Why mental illness seems to be rising among college students is unclear. Better medications and therapies are likely making it possible for more young adults with even serious mental disorders to attend college. The growing number of outreach programs by colleges is likely bringing more young adults into treatment. Advocacy groups like Active Minds Inc., a nonprofit with chapters on 428 campuses, are trying to reduce the stigma around having a mental illness. But many students arrive unprepared, experts say. ‚ÄúWhat happens is everyone is under the impression that at the end of high school, magically college will be different,‚Äù says Anne Marie Albano, director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders in New York. ‚ÄúThat once she or he gets away from the same old routine and the same old peers that never connected with him, and the teachers who were mean, it is going to be different. And it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù Indeed, in a study published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2014 that followed 288 adolescents and young adults with anxiety disorders, nearly half relapsed within six years of treatment. Late adolescence is also when more serious illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder often kick in. Living away from home for the first time, making new friends and handling the rigors of college coursework can all make the transition to college difficult‚Äîespecially when those are added on top of an existing mental illness. ‚ÄúEven good change is stressful,‚Äù says Micky M. Sharma, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Office of Student Life Counseling and Consultation Service at Ohio State University. He says traffic in the counseling center surges in mid-October, around the time of the first midterm exams. Psychologists and psychiatrists say it is critical for students to become as independent as possible during the months before school starts. Parents are on the hook, too. Now is the time for them to learn to let go. They should move from doing things for teens to taking on the role of adviser or coach, experts say. That includes formulating strategies and weighing solutions to problems with children and‚Äîafter they make attempts at independence‚Äîreviewing how things went. This often means parents must confront their own anxieties about their children failing. Ideally, parents should be practicing letting go all along and not waiting until just before college starts. Concerned adults should try to avoid becoming what Dr. Sharma calls snowplow parents: those who remain too involved at college. ‚ÄúThey will just come in and knock me out of the way to make sure their son or daughter gets what they need. Just because you can text your son and daughter 10 times a day doesn‚Äôt mean that should be happening.‚Äù Dr. Albano at Columbia runs a six-to-eight-week college readiness program for high school seniors with anxiety disorders and depression. During ‚Äúexposure‚Äù group sessions, teenagers role-play to practice talking to professors and meeting new people‚Äîand learn to deal with negative or anxious thoughts that arise. Dr. Albano has Columbia colleagues act the part of skeptical professors. The teens practice asking for help or extensions on assignments. Students are also sent to cafeterias at local universities to practice getting food and approaching groups of peers. Then, in periodic transition sessions, parents and teens meet together. The goal is to help parents ease up on any overprotection. Often, parents of children who have struggled with mental illness have responded by doing more and more things for them. Then the children ‚Äústart falling behind their peers in developmental tasks,‚Äù Dr. Albano says. Dr. Albano has compiled a list of young adult milestones that include managing money responsibly and establishing emotional independence from parents as part of the overall program dubbed LEAP (for Launching Emerging Adults Program). Parents and teens fill out what she calls scaffolding forms that detail which life tasks the teens can do independently, which they can‚Äôt and which are in the gray zone‚Äîones they sometimes do on their own, sometimes not. The families work on moving tasks from the dependent zone to the independent one. Dr. Albano says college-bound students should go to yearly physicals by themselves. They should also take at least one out-of-town trip alone, including making travel reservations and getting to the train or plane by themselves. ‚ÄúIf you end up on a train going to Boston instead of Baltimore, all the better,‚Äù Dr. Albano says. ‚ÄúThey learn it is not a catastrophe to make mistakes.‚Äù Students arriving on campus also need to make sure they can handle taking their medication and getting refills on their own. Louis Kraus, chief of child psychiatry at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, suggests students get a seven-day pill pack and set a daily alarm on their smartphones to help remember medication. Dr. Kraus has frank discussions about drinking with students on stimulants and benzodiazepines, drugs that can be deadly when combined with alcohol. If teens are stable, they may be able to continue working with their home psychologist or psychiatrist via phone or Skype sessions, Dr. Kraus says. But establishing a relationship with a doctor near campus is critical if there‚Äôs a risk of a relapse or medication changes. While college counseling centers often offer emergency sessions, waits to initiate regular therapy appointments can be several weeks long. Many centers have caps on the number of sessions students can have. About ¬º of colleges have no access to psychiatrists except as a private referral, according to a 2013 survey by the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors. Still, these problems are solvable. Ms. Lanzillo, the Brown student, found her equilibrium after finding treatment near campus. The transition also proved tricky for Josh Ratner, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Maryland in College Park. He says not having some basic life skills made his move to college much more stressful. ‚ÄúA lot of parents don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre babying their kids.

Anxiety and depression are rising among college students, with 14.3% and 12% of them being diagnosed or treated for these disorders in the past year, respectively. Maintaining good mental health away from home requires preparation to ensure independence and adaptability to new environments and challenges. Experts suggest that both students and their parents need to concentrate on fostering independence in the months preceding college. Parents should act more as advisers or coaches, helping their children strategize, consider solutions, and learn from their attempts at independence. Parents must also learn to let go and avoid becoming overly involved when their children start college. To help students build independence, mental health professionals recommend the practice of role-playing, exposure to group sessions, and gradually transferring dependent tasks to independent ones in the months leading up to college. Additionally, students should learn to manage their medications and establish a relationship with a doctor near campus in case of a relapse or medication change. By addressing potential issues and providing strategies for maintaining good mental health, students are more likely to navigate the challenges and stressors of college life successfully."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, were born in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. When the boys were aged two, their parents amicably divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. The Bills opened the 2015 season with a 27-14 win over the Indianapolis Colts. Frustrated by the Bills leading the NFL in penalties heading into their Week 5 game against the Tennessee Titans, Ryan gave the entire team wristbands with the message \\"Yes sir\\". These were the only words he wanted his players to use with officials if they were flagged. After being flagged 17 times in Week 4 loss against the New York Giants, the Bills were penalized only seven times in their 14-13 victory over the Titans. The Bills entered their bye week with a 3-4 record after losing in London to the Jacksonville Jaguars.  Ryan gave the whole team the week off during the bye, and he himself found a secluded beach to \\"get away and focus\\". The Bills came out of their bye week and defeated the Miami Dolphins by a score of 3-17, improving their season record to 4-4. Ryan is now 2-5 all time following a bye week. Ryan returned to MetLife Stadium in Week 10 for a much anticipated Thursday Night Football game against the Jets. The Bills won the game by a score of 22-17, and improved to 5-4 on the season. Ryan faced questions before and after the game about his decision to name IK Enemkpali, who had been released by the Jets in preseason after breaking quarterback Geno Smith's jaw in an altercation, as Buffalo's captain for the game.  The Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as coach, as they were eliminated in Week 15 with a 35-25 loss to the Washington Redskins on December 20, extending their drought to 16 seasons, the NFL's longest active drought. They finished the season with an 8-8 record. Entity:","output":"Rex Ryan"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Plants and animals long ago died - They are buried under layers of soil - Pressure builds over time - The remains liquefy A:","output":"The final step of the process you described is the formation of fossil fuels. Once plants and animals have died and become buried under layers of soil, with pressure building over time and causing their remains to liquefy, they eventually transform into valuable sources of energy known as fossil fuels. This transformation occurs through a series of biological, chemical, and geological processes that take millions of years to complete. Fossil fuels include coal, petroleum (oil), and natural gas. These fuels are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen, and they are used worldwide to produce electricity, generate heat, and provide transportation. The specific type of fossil fuel formed depends on the composition of the original organic material, the environmental conditions during its decomposition, and the amount of heat and pressure exerted on the remains. The formation of coal, for example, generally begins with the accumulation of plant material in swampy environments. The plant material, which is rich in carbon, undergoes various chemical and biological processes, eventually forming peat. As peat becomes buried under more sediment, it experiences increasing temperature and pressure, triggering a series of changes eventually leading to the formation of coal. Petroleum and natural gas, on the other hand, primarily form from the remains of small marine organisms, such as plankton and algae. These organisms accumulate on the seafloor and become buried in sediment over millions of years. They undergo a series of chemical transformations under the influence of heat and pressure, eventually forming a complex mixture of hydrocarbons known as kerogen. Depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the type of kerogen, it can eventually transform into petroleum or natural gas. Once fossil fuels are formed, they accumulate within porous rock layers beneath the Earth's surface, often trapped by impermeable layers that prevent them from escaping. They can then be extracted through various methods, such as mining for coal and drilling for oil and natural gas. Tapping into these rich sources of energy has played a crucial role in the development of modern society, though the burning of fossil fuels has also raised serious environmental concerns, including increased greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Consequently, the search for cleaner and renewable energy sources is of utmost importance for the future sustainability of our planet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The phrase \\"The River Urechioiu is a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania\\" and \\"The Urechioiu River is a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania\\" essentially convey the same meaning. In both sentences, the Urechioiu River is identified as a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania. The only difference between the two sentences is the order of the words \\"River\\" and \\"Urechioiu.\\" In the first sentence, \\"River\\" comes before the name, while in the second sentence, \\"River\\" follows the name. Despite the slight difference in wording, both sentences present the same information, confirming that the Urechioiu River is a tributary of the Sitna River. The term \\"tributary\\" refers to a smaller river or stream that flows into a larger river or body of water. In this context, the Urechioiu River flows into the Sitna River, which is common knowledge established in both sentences. In addition, both sentences specify that these rivers are located in Romania, which again confirms that they share the same meaning. Furthermore, it is not uncommon to see slight variations in the way river names are mentioned in different texts or references. People from different regions might use different conventions to name rivers ‚Äì some might place the word \\"River\\" before the name, while others might place it after. In such instances, the key aspect to understand is the relationship between the rivers, which is clearly mentioned as a tributary association in both sentences. In conclusion, both statements convey the same meaning with a subtle difference in wording. The Urechioiu River is unmistakably identified as a tributary of the Sitna River in Romania, regardless of how the name structure is presented in either sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the other hand, tensions between nations remain, particularly in the case of the United States and China, which have conflicts over trade practices, intellectual property, and regional dominance. In terms of technology, artificial intelligence, automation, and digitalization continue to disrupt traditional industries while creating new opportunities for innovation and growth. The rapid advancement of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is helping decrease dependence on fossil fuels and combat climate change. Environmentally, the world is grappling with the increasing urgency to address climate change and its associated challenges. The Paris Agreement, signed by 196 countries, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but implementing effective climate policies remains a challenge. Socially, the world is more interconnected than ever before, thanks to advancements in communication and transportation technology. However, these connections have also revealed stark differences in wealth and access to resources between countries, leading to persistent global inequality. Economically, many countries are continuing to recover from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on global financial markets, employment rates, and supply chains. Governments around the world have implemented various stimulus measures to support their economies, with varying degrees of success. Now, let's consider the second question. If there had been no World War, the current scenario would potentially look quite different. It is worth noting that discussing hypothetical events is inherently speculative, but there are some aspects we can explore. Without the World Wars, specifically World War II, it is highly doubtful that we would have experienced the rapid technological advancements that emerged during and after those conflicts. The wars accelerated research and development in fields such as aviation, telecommunications, and nuclear energy. The geopolitical landscape would also likely be significantly altered, with European colonial empires possibly remaining intact for a longer period or undergoing different trajectories of decolonization. Additionally, the political ideology might have evolved very differently. The end of World War II set the stage for the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was characterized by a battle of opposing ideologies: capitalism and communism, respectively. Without the World Wars, this rivalry could have taken on a different form, or possibly other ideologies may have emerged as dominant forces. Lastly, the formation of international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union could have been affected. These entities were established, in part, as a response to the devastation caused by the World Wars, and their absence might have influenced the nature and significance of global cooperation today. To sum up, the current scenario of the world is defined by multifaceted interactions among political, technological, environmental, social, and economic factors. If there were no World Wars, key elements of today's world could be altered, including political dynamics, globalization, and technological innovations. The two questions posed are not paraphrases of each other, as they address two distinct inquiries: one asks about the present circumstances, while the other explores a hypothetical alternate history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It was released worldwide on September 7, 2007, as the fourth single of the album. The song was written by Tawanna Dabney and its producers StarGate; Michael Jackson also received a songwriting credit for the sampling of the line \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\\" from Jackson's 1983 single \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\".

L'utilisation de munitions pendant un conflit arm√© doit prendre en consid√©ration tous les principes du droit international humanitaire, que les munitions puissent ou non devenir des restes explosifs de guerre. Translate to English","output":"The use of ammunition during an armed conflict must take into consideration all the principles of international humanitarian law, regardless of whether the ammunition may or may not become explosive remnants of war. The employment of ammunition in an armed conflict should adhere to all principles outlined under international humanitarian law, irrespective of the possibility of the ammunition turning into explosive remnants of war. In essence, using munitions in a conflict zone necessitates thorough observance of international guidelines dedicated to minimizing harm to civilians, combatants no longer taking an active part in hostilities, and the environment. International humanitarian law (IHL) established these principles to ensure that armed conflicts are conducted in a manner that reduces unnecessary suffering and collateral damage. The four central tenets of IHL include distinction, proportionality, military necessity, and humanity. 1. Distinction: This principle asserts the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants (civilians). Parties involved in conflict must ensure that any attack is directed solely at military objectives and combatants, while sparing civilians and non-military objects. 2. Proportionality: The requirement of proportionality means that any attack must not cause harm that is excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage. It aims to prevent the use of munitions that would lead to excessive civilian casualties or extensive destruction of civilian property. 3. Military Necessity: This principle obliges armed forces to minimize destruction, violence, and the use of overwhelming force, focusing solely on what is needed to achieve a military objective. The use of munitions should be limited to ensuring the swift and decisive victory of the conflict with minimal harm and damage to all parties involved. 4. Humanity: Also referred to as the principle of unnecessary suffering, it prohibits utilizing munitions that may inflict excessive suffering or injury to combatants or spread uncontrollable harm to the environment. The use of certain types of weapons, such as chemical or biological weapons, is strictly prohibited under this principle. When employing ammunition in a conflict context, it is crucial that parties also take into consideration the possible lasting consequences in the form of explosive remnants of war. These unexploded ordnances pose severe threats to civilian populations, hinder socio-economic development, and obstruct post-conflict reconstruction efforts. In conclusion, the use of ammunition during armed conflicts demands strict adherence to international humanitarian law principles. This approach ensures that all parties involved in the conflict strive to reduce any potential harm to civilians, the environment, and combatants no longer taking an active part in hostilities. Additionally, considering the impacts of explosive remnants of war is vital in order to mitigate lasting repercussions on affected communities and environments."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on dennis hargrove cooke 's:    - death place     - title     - caption     - successor     - death date     - predecessor       - term end     - term start     - birth date     - name     - image     - birth place     Bio: dennis hargrove cooke -lrb- february 23 , 1904 -- march 1982 -rrb- was the fourth president of what is now east carolina university . he was born on february 23 , 1904 in maiden , north carolina . dr. cooke received the a.b. degree from duke university in 1925 . he also earned an m.a. degree from duke in 1928 . he was a teaching fellow at duke university in 1928-29 , and a teaching fellow at peabody college in 1929-30 . he then received a doctorate in 1930 from peabody college . before becoming president , cooke served as an elementary school principal , high school principal , associate professor , and chairman of the department of educational administration . cooke assumed his duties at east carolina teachers college on august 1 , 1946 and announced his resignation in may 1947 .

Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding 2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he angrily denies any involvement with the kidnapping. Tom agrees to the FBI's instructions for delivering the ransom. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby.

Labour and disability charities are facing a growing public backlash for making a ‚Äòdisgusting spectacle‚Äô of remarks by a Government minister about minimum pay for disabled workers. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle looked shocked as a BBC Question Time audience turned on her when she demanded that welfare reform minister Lord Freud should resign or be sacked. She insisted the peer had been ‚Äòoffensive‚Äô in remarks secretly recorded by a Labour official at a fringe meeting of last month‚Äôs Conservative Party conference. Scroll down for video. Shadow Cabinet minister Angela Eagle on Question Time when she demanded Lord Freud be sacked. Lord Freud was responding to a councillor with a severely disabled daughter who suggested that people with mental health problems may be unable to work because employers are unwilling to pay them the statutory minimum. Lord Freud suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‚Äònot worth‚Äô the ¬£6.50 minimum wage and mused on whether the Government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces. Labour leader Ed Miliband ambushed David Cameron with a transcript of the recording at Prime Minister‚Äôs Questions this week, also insisting the minister should be sacked. He has remained in his job after apologising, but Miss Eagle insisted on Thursday night: ‚ÄòI do think he should resign. I think what he said‚Ä¶ has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people. ‚ÄòThere are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment. The answer to that isn‚Äôt to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage.‚Äô Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on the programme it was clear Lord Freud had been talking about the state ‚Äòtopping up‚Äô the incomes of disabled people. Lord Freud¬†suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‚Äònot worth‚Äô the ¬£6.50 minimum wage. One audience member agreed: ‚ÄòI think Angela Eagle is being extremely disingenuous. I think we all knew what he meant, even though he said it clumsily.‚Äô Another person in the audience in Newbury, Berkshire, told Miss Eagle: ‚ÄòWhat you are doing is hypocritical point scoring and it‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äô A young woman said: ‚ÄòI just wanted to see whether you [Eagle] would use this as a political football and you have done ‚Äì thanks Angela.‚Äô Yesterday a Conservative MP also defended Lord Freud, insisting that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people‚Äôs chances of finding work. Jackie Doyle-Price, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said the way Lord Freud‚Äôs remarks had been twisted by Labour and parts of the charitable sector was ‚Äòfrankly disgusting‚Äô. It emerged the charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, itself warned an estimated 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities had part-time jobs or had their working hours cut as a direct result of the national minimum wage. In 2000, it called for an urgent revision of the rules to enable ‚Äòlow output work‚Äô to be exempted from the rules. It now says the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed in the last 15 years and debate has moved on, ‚Äòas has our position‚Äô. Conservative MP Henry Smith said: ‚ÄòCertain charities have seemed quick to make political attacks on what is a very serious and complex issue. Charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for Labour‚Äôs political point scoring.‚Äô Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, whose wife Margaret was badly disabled in the Brighton bomb, said the attacks on Lord Freud were a ‚Äòdisgusting spectacle‚Äô. ‚ÄòWhat Lord Freud was being asked about was whether there are handicapped people who cannot produce enough to justify in purely economic terms a wage of ¬£6 an hour. My wife was capable of earning her pay as an experienced nurse until the sadistic criminals of IRA/Sinn Fein crippled her. She is worth no less today, but she could not justify a pay rate of ¬£6 an hour. Lord Freud was mulling over how to help such people.‚Äô Labour's Department for Trade and Industry published guidance in 2003 on when and where it might be acceptable to pay disabled people far less than the minimum wage. The department, then run by Patricia Hewitt, said the minimum wage applied to all workers ‚Äì able-bodied or disabled. However, disabled people could be exempted from the minimum wage when they did work-related activity for therapeutic reasons, with no contractual obligation to work. The guidance gave various examples of when that could apply, after the Government consulted with organisations including Scope, Mencap and the TUC. It gave the example of a farm where people develop social skills through involvement in agriculture, horticulture, caring for animals and training. Other examples included a charity running a workshop for people with mental health problems, which it suggested, could pay them as little as ¬£4 per day. A third example was a trust running a facility for mental health outpatients which does activities such as packing and assembly. They could be paid varying amounts up to just ¬£20 per week.

Kids usually get toys from \\"Santa\\" on Christmas Day, but it's also customary to give gifts to others you love. Presents don't have to be big or expensive. Even giving a chocolate bar, baked goods, or small handmade gifts is welcome.  It's also a good time of year to offer gifts to those in need. For instance, you can give toys to toy drives for families who are down on their luck or send packages to troops overseas. For a bit of fun, try opening 1 gift on Christmas Eve. Books or pajamas make good Christmas Eve gifts. However, while gift-giving is fun, there's no reason to go into debt for it. Make sure you spend only what you can afford. Sending Christmas cards is a tradition this time of year, and it's a way to let people know you care. Include a little note about how you're thinking of the person and wish them well. You can also send Christmas cards to nursing homes or troops overseas to let them know they're remembered at Christmas. Charity is a hallmark of Christmas, and one way you can participate in that is to pick a charity to give money to. Some common ones that people give to this time of year include food banks, homeless shelters, and other charities that serve those who are down on their luck.  You won't have to look hard to find someplace to give, as many charities put up donation centers and boxes this time of year. You could also buy groceries anonymously for a family you know is struggling. You don't have to give money to help out this time of year. Offer to hang Christmas decorations for a neighbor who can't do it or send them baked goods. Collect food, blankets, coats, or other supplies for local charities, or volunteer at a homeless shelter or soup kitchen on Christmas Day.

The club proves to be a place of conflict and self-discovery, helping Lauryn to realize that even though plans may change, dreams never do. -LieslJadeThe movie opens in Indiana, where Lauryn Kirk (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel - who works as a mechanic in the family garage - is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing.

Is the premise \\"Two young boys wander through a crowd wearing bright yellow shirts.\\" true if \\"The two boys are swimming in the ocean.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"Two young boys wander through a crowd wearing bright yellow shirts\\" cannot be considered true if the statement \\"The two boys are swimming in the ocean\\" is accurate, as the two scenarios depict different situations. However, it is crucial to examine each scenario closely to determine the validity of the initial premise based on the second statement provided. In the first scenario, it is described that two young boys are wandering through a crowd while wearing bright yellow shirts. This scenario presents an image of the boys being on land, likely in a public place, where there is a gathering of people. The crowd implies that they are not alone and that there could be an event or situation where people have gathered. The bright yellow shirts on the boys could either be a stylistic choice or indicate that they are part of a group or event.  On the other hand, the second statement indicates that the two boys are swimming in the ocean. This directly contradicts the first scenario, as swimming in the ocean would require the boys to be in the water, away from any crowd they could be wandering through on land. Furthermore, it is unlikely that they would be wearing bright yellow shirts while swimming, as they would typically be dressed in swimwear or possibly wetsuits, depending on the water conditions and temperature. Additionally, people usually do not swim in a crowd, as it could be dangerous and hinder their ability to swim effectively. In light of the given information, one can conclude that the original premise is not true if the second statement holds. They depict two entirely different situations with distinct environments, activities, and conditions involved. Consequently, if the two boys are indeed swimming in the ocean, it cannot be true they are wandering through a crowd wearing bright yellow shirts at the same time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother‚Äîboth newly arrived in the UK from South Africa‚Äîwere staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa.

Here's a short story: The toddler moved faster in the sandbox than in the patch of grass because it had (A) more resistance (B) less resistance.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"sandbox\\" and  \\"patchy grass\\"?","output":"The most sensical answer between the two scenarios would be (B) less resistance, which is the sandbox. Let's analyze both scenarios to provide a comprehensive explanation: In the sandbox: A sandbox is typically composed of small particles, such as sand, which when compacted, create a relatively stable and smooth surface for the toddler to move on. Sand particles tend to stick together, thanks to their minute size and the moisture present in the environment. The static friction between the sand particles creates a firm footing, thus allowing the toddler to maintain a steady pace without exerting much effort. As compared to natural ground, a sandbox offers a consistent and even surface. This consistent texture allows for minimal variance in the terrain, making it easy for the toddler to move faster as they don't have to adjust their balance and grip repeatedly, unlike on patchy grass. In addition, sand offers little resistance against the toddler‚Äôs movements, which makes it relatively easier for them to move about. In the patch of grass: The patch of grass, on the other hand, offers more resistance when compared to the sandbox. A patchy grass surface is often uneven and has irregularities, such as tufts of grass, bumps, or other elements that make it hard for the toddler to maintain a constant pace. These natural elements necessitate constant adjustments in balance and force the toddler to tread cautiously, potentially slowing them down as they need to adapt their movements to the irregular terrain. Furthermore, grass surfaces are inherently more slippery than sandy ones, particularly due to the presence of dew or moisture. The increase in slipperiness demands more effort from the toddler to achieve a firm grip on the ground, which could reduce their overall speed. The increased difficulty in maintaining a strong footing significantly increases the resistance the toddler experiences in comparison to the sandbox. In conclusion, between the sandbox and patchy grass, the most sensical answer is indeed the sandbox, as it offers less resistance, allowing the toddler to move faster. The consistency and stability provided by the sand surface, as well as the reduced slipperiness, contribute to this outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you. A good example of what it would look like would be the scene from the terminator 2 where Arnold cuts the skin off from his arm. The ambulance came and had to call another team to collect the body.

The Peace of Utrecht established the principle that to preserve the balance of power, the thrones of Spain and France would remain separate, regardless of dynastic rules of inheritance. This makes it a significant milestone both in the development of the nation state and the concept of collective security. Britain is often portrayed as the main beneficiary of the war, with Utrecht marking the beginning of its rise to commercial domination of Europe. It ended the war as the largest naval power in the world while the Netherlands, France and Spain were economically exhausted and their fleets severely reduced. France accepted the Protestant succession, ensuring a smooth inheritance by George I in August 1714 and ended support for the Stuarts by the terms of 1716 Anglo-French Treaty. Possession of Gibraltar and Menorca gave British control of the Western Mediterranean and it gained commercial access to Spanish America; resentment over this would lead to the 1739 Anglo-Spanish War. Spain retained its independence, the majority of its Empire and Philip was confirmed as King; in return, they ceded the Spanish Netherlands and most of their Italian possessions to Austria, Sicily to Savoy and Gibraltar and Menorca to Britain. Under the Bourbons, it became far more centralised, the Nueva Planta decrees of 1707 abolishing regional political structures and transferring their powers to Madrid. Reforms strengthened state finances and Spain recovered remarkably quickly; while British naval power prevented the capture of Naples and Sicily in 1718, it successfully did so in 1734 with Menorca regained in 1782.

The \\"drop\\" is the high-energy section where the beat kicks in, and it's typically preceded by a build-up that increases tension. The drop propels the song forward and often leaves the listener feeling exhilarated.  The best \\"drops\\" songs, therefore, would be those with powerful, catchy, and highly engaging drops. Since musical taste can be subjective, I will provide a list of drops that have become popular or have been praised by many: 1.

Knife Party - \\"Centipede\\": This high-energy track is known for its intense drop featuring the menacing sound of a centipede. 5. Zedd ft. Foxes - \\"Clarity\\": The beautiful vocal harmonies combined with a powerful progressive house drop make for a compelling listening experience. 6. DJ Snake & Lil Jon - \\"Turn Down for What\\": The hard-hitting, electronic baseline is what sets this drop apart, making it a popular choice in dance clubs worldwide. 7. The Chainsmokers ft.

Choose your answer from: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","output":"1). Yes. The statement \\"Cheerleaders are practicing pyramid routines.\\" implies that cheerleaders are engaged in the activity of performing or rehearsing pyramid formations. Pyramid routines are a type of cheerleading move where the cheerleaders form a human pyramid, with members of the team supporting each other to create a multi-tiered structure. This often involves a combination of acrobatics, balance, and teamwork to ensure the stability and safety of the formation. As the statement explicitly mentions that cheerleaders are practicing pyramid routines, it logically follows that cheerleaders are doing pyramids. In this context, \\"doing pyramids\\" refers to the act of executing or practicing the aforementioned pyramid routines. In cheerleading, pyramids are typically integrated into larger routines, which may include other components such as jumps, tumbling, and stunts. The purpose of these routines is often to demonstrate the skills, athleticism, and teamwork of the squad, as well as to generate excitement and support for the team or event being cheered for. Additionally, performing pyramids requires a significant amount of practice and dedication from the cheerleading team. Developing the strength, coordination, and trust necessary to safely and effectively carry out these routines can take time and effort, so it is not uncommon for cheerleaders to spend a considerable portion of their practice time working on pyramid routines.

What is an answer for this question: Which person didn't have to take medicines to slow down the virus? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, person A, James, who is 35 years old and has been HIV positive for 20 years, would have likely needed to take medicines to slow down the progression of the virus. HIV, if left untreated, can eventually lead to the development of AIDS, which is a life-threatening condition. The proper use of medications, such as antiretroviral therapy (ART), can significantly delay the development of AIDS, sometimes even by more than 20 years. Person B, Bill, who is 54 years old and not HIV positive, would not need to take any medications related to HIV or AIDS, as he is not infected with the virus. The background information suggests that someone who acquires HIV after 50 years of age can still expect to reach an average human lifespan with proper treatment. However, in Bill's case, he doesn't have HIV, so there is no need for him to take any medicines to address this particular issue.

My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay. Now, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who does the commander of the Sacred guard fall in love with?, using the article: The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars, during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Phillippides ahead to hold out with the Sacred Guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they successfully beat back the Persians., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The commander of the Sacred Guard, Phillippides, falls in love with Andromeda, the daughter of Creuso. This is seen in the text where it states, \\"his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso.\\" Step 1: Identify the main subject of the question, which is \\"the commander of the Sacred Guard.\\" Step 2: Find the part of the article that refers to the commander of the Sacred Guard, which is when it mentions Phillippides. Step 3: Look for information about Phillippides' love interest in the article. This can be found in the sentence that describes his heart being taken by a young girl, Andromeda. Step 4: Verify that Andromeda is indeed the love interest of Phillippides by confirming that there are no other potential love interests mentioned in the article. Step 5: Formulate the answer to the question based on the information found in the article, stating that Phillippides falls in love with Andromeda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In evaluating a sentence's linguistic acceptability, linguists consider its grammaticality, semantics, pragmatics, and social appropriateness. Let's consider each of these aspects in relation to the given sentence. 1. Grammaticality: The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the general Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure typical of English sentences. The subject, \\"John,\\" is a proper noun, the verb \\"spoke\\" is in the simple past tense, and \\"intimately,\\" an adverb, modifies the verb \\"to speak.\\" The prepositional phrase \\"to Mary\\" indicates the recipient of John's speech. All the parts of speech used are appropriate and correctly placed. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence is clear and unambiguous. \\"Intimately\\" is an adverb that gives more information about how John spoke to Mary. In this context, \\"intimately\\" implies that the conversation was personal, private, or had emotional depth. There is no confusion regarding what the sentence is trying to convey. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatically, the sentence is also acceptable. The implied context of a conversation between two people is easily understood by most English speakers. Furthermore, the adverb \\"intimately\\" might hint at how the relationship between John and Mary is close or significant, suggesting that this detail is relevant or essential in the particular situation in which the sentence is used. 4. Social appropriateness: The sentence does not contain any offensive, discriminatory, or taboo language or subjects. Therefore, a linguist would likely consider it socially appropriate, although this factor may be more subjective and dependent on the culture and the context in which the sentence is used. In conclusion, a linguist would rate the sentence \\"John spoke intimately to Mary.\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it is grammatically correct, semantically clear, pragmatically understandable, and socially appropriate.

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Where do the majority of Native Americans live in Montana?\\" is in \\"Approximately 66,000 people of Native American heritage live in Montana. Stemming from multiple treaties and federal legislation, including the Indian Appropriations Act (1851), the Dawes Act (1887), and the Indian Reorganization Act (1934), seven Indian reservations, encompassing eleven tribal nations, were created in Montana. A twelfth nation, the Little Shell Chippewa is a \\"landless\\" people headquartered in Great Falls, recognized by the state of Montana but not by the U.S. Government. The Blackfeet nation is headquartered on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation (1851) in Browning, Crow on the Crow Indian Reservation (1851) in Crow Agency, Confederated Salish and Kootenai and Pend d'Oreille on the Flathead Indian Reservation (1855) in Pablo, Northern Cheyenne on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation (1884) at Lame Deer, Assiniboine and Gros Ventre on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation (1888) in Fort Belknap Agency, Assiniboine and Sioux on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation (1888) at Poplar, and Chippewa-Cree on the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation (1916) near Box Elder. Approximately 63% of all Native people live off the reservations, concentrated in the larger Montana cities with the largest concentration of urban Indians in Great Falls.

What Are Some Of The Biggest Red Flags In An Interviewee? This question originally appeared on Quora: What are some of the biggest red flags in an interviewee? Answer by Sarah Smith, VP of Recruiting/HR, on Quora I‚Äôve had the fortune to interview hundreds of people (maybe over a thousand by now) in private education and technology and have found the following to be the biggest red flags in interviews: Victim Mentality To me as an interviewer, there is no bigger red flag than victim mentality. When I ask, ‚ÄúTell me about your interest in this role,‚Äù and I get an answer along the lines of, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm at Facebook/Google/Microsoft/<insert other larger company> and have really tapped out on what I can learn here. There‚Äôs no more room for me to grow,‚Äù you‚Äôve pretty much lost me. Are you seriously trying to tell me that there are literally no more opportunities for learning at a 10-30-100 THOUSAND person company? If you cannot find anything to learn there, how are you going to do when you have to roll up your sleeves and do a fair bit of less glamorous work at a start-up? I‚Äôve worked in some very mundane jobs earlier in my career and have never been ‚Äúbored‚Äù. There is always something to learn. Similarly, I see a huge red flag when an applicant talks about their boss ‚Äúhating‚Äù them or really anyone in the organization that is ‚Äúagainst‚Äù them. Talk of being ‚Äúlimited‚Äù or ‚Äúcapped‚Äù are also words I associate with victim mentality. It‚Äôs certainly possible that you are at a company or team that is a sinking ship and you want to get out, but you can always find something to learn in all situations and paint your interest in a role in a positive, learning light. Lack of Product Knowledge or Passion I have little patience for candidates who have not used our product. It is the easiest, most straight-forward way to prepare for an interview. I‚Äôm baffled by candidates who have never used our product or say that they don‚Äôt use it much. You are about to spend likely 50%+ of your waking hours on this product. Shouldn‚Äôt you love it and be compelled by it? Take the time to read a few blog posts from the company. Use the product. Ask and answer a few questions. It will help you know if you want to actually work on it and will help you perform better and more knowledgeably in your interviews. As one other guidepost, I recommend thinking about preparing for an interview like you would prepare for a final exam. You should spend hours and hours reading and preparing. Whenever I‚Äôve interviewed anywhere, I spent at least 10-20 hours researching before the first conversation. Show that you really want the opportunity! Arrogance Luckily, it‚Äôs rare for someone to make it too far in our process if they are arrogant but every once in awhile someone gets to onsite. If we hear of anyone treating anyone at our company poorly (receptionist, recruiting team, interviewers, custodial staff), that‚Äôs a huge red flag. If you come into an interview with a huge ego, it‚Äôs unlikely to go away when you‚Äôre working in a team with humble, nice people. Short Terms of Employment I don‚Äôt immediately reject applicants who have a shorter term at one company but I‚Äôd certainly want to know why. For example, if I saw an applicant at any pre or post-IPO tech company for less than a year or two, I‚Äôd ask why as I want to confirm whether they were involuntarily terminated.

Question: Title: Doesn't fit onto my Graco Safe Seat Review: I bought this because my son, at 5 months, decided the car seat had become a torture device and cried from the moment he was strapped in. We were hoping this would distract him, but we could never get it to clip properly onto the car seat. It would usually fall off en route to wherever we were going and it didn't do much to distract him. In the end we discovered a lullaby version of Radiohead's \\"No Surprises\\" which was magical. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review provided can be considered to be negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the product they purchased as it did not fulfill their expectations or desired outcome. They state that the product was intended to distract their son from the discomfort caused by the car seat, but they encountered problems in attaching it properly. Furthermore, the product would often fall off while in transit. Instead of serving its primary purpose, the product failed to entertain or distract their son from crying and therefore could not provide a solution for their issues with the car seat. The discovery of the lullaby version of Radiohead's \\"No Surprises\\" is mentioned as an alternative solution to the problem, rendering the purchased item unnecessary. In conclusion, the reviewer's experience with the product is mostly negative because it did not address their needs and was difficult to use. The positive outcome that arose from an alternative solution further emphasizes the product's ineffectiveness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But zucchini, summer‚Äôs most underloved vegetable (technically, yes, it‚Äôs a fruit), comes in for a lot of grief. It‚Äôs so prolific! It‚Äôs so cheap! What are we going to do with all of it? I suppose it‚Äôs not just zucchini‚Äôs omnipresence but its mild flavor ‚Äî and indeed, the difficulty of bringing out some of its character ‚Äî that makes us feel challenged. But along with the ubiquitous yellow squash that you prepare in the same way, zucchini is the workhorse of late summer, firm enough to stand up to all cooking methods, tender enough to eat raw, quick-cooking and amenable to all kinds of flavors. Bonus: They maintain firmness and freshness longer than any of the more beloved summer vegetables. When buying, look for the smallest zucchini and yellow squash; they don‚Äôt have to be designated ‚Äúbaby,‚Äù but something under six inches long and an inch or so in diameter is ideal; it will have better flavor and smaller, less cottony seeds. If a zucchini is tender enough, you can even eat the stem. You may also come across the flying-saucer-shaped pattypan squash, which is a bit trickier to cut up but can be used in any of the recipes here. No doubt you have grilled and saut√©ed zucchini, and have probably also eaten it raw (even if it‚Äôs just a bite taken while chopping it to be saut√©ed), but it‚Äôs possible you‚Äôve yet to explore the wonders of zucchini in the microwave. Microwaving makes zucchini silky and tender with the push of a button; if you‚Äôre without a microwave, you can move those recipes to a saucepan over medium heat. Appreciate the zucchini.

He needs to decide which research should get further funding.  and a hint : Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research. However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results.

When a rubber band is snapped, it causes the particles within the rubber band to vibrate. This vibration is transferred to the surrounding air particles, creating sound waves. These sound waves travel through the air and ultimately result in the perception of noise by our ears. Furthermore, the teacher's hint also mentioned that vibration can lead to wear and fatigue of parts. This implies that the noise generated from the snapping of a rubber band may result from the rapid movement and friction of its particles. The relationship between vibration and noise can also be understood as follows: when an object vibrates, the movement of particles near the object's surface causes fluctuations in the surrounding pressure. These pressure fluctuations then propagate through the air or any other medium as waves, eventually reaching our ears, which perceive these pressure variations as sound. Noise is typically characterized as random, unwanted, or unpleasant sound, which is often the result of irregular vibrations. In this context, the snapping of a rubber band creates noise since the vibration and subsequent sound generated are abrupt and unexpected. This makes the option of noise the most suitable answer to the quiz question as it reflects the direct result of snapping a rubber band based on the provided hints."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.  Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids.  Which scientist read less about dairying ants milking the aphids? The answer is:","output":"Ellie read less about dairying ants milking the aphids. In this scenario, we have two entomologists who are studying different aspects of ants' behaviors and habits. Pam is focused on ants that farm aphids, while Ellie is investigating leafcutter ants. It is crucial to understand the different behaviors and characteristics of the specific ants they are studying. Dairying ants, also known as aphid-tending ants, are known for their mutualistic relationship with aphids, where they protect the aphids and consume the honeydew they produce. This process involves the ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae, as mentioned in the given question. The study of these ants and their behavior with aphids is directly related to Pam's research as her interest lies within ants that farm aphids. On the other hand, Ellie is investigating leafcutter ants. Leafcutter ants are famous for their behavior of cutting leaves and using them as a substrate to cultivate fungus gardens, which serve as their primary food source. While this is also an exciting and complex topic in entomology, it is separate from the study of dairying ants and their relationship with aphids. Leafcutter ants do not have the mutualistic relationship with aphids, and therefore milking aphids is not a behavior observed within this group. Consequently, Ellie would read less about dairying ants milking the aphids, as her research focus is on a different type of ant with distinct habits, specifically the leafcutter ants. Her study does not involve the ants' relationship with aphids, and thus, she would not delve deeper into the process of ants milking the aphids.

But the last video was sent in February 2011, and it's unclear where Bergdahl is being held now. He was a private at the time. The army has been giving Bergdahl promotions that would have come to him had his army career gone as planned. If he returns home safely, the army will give him all the back pay that he has earned while in captivity. His father has rarely spoken to the media. Bowe Bergdahl, an adventurer and gentleman. Resolution close? In his exchange with Murphy, he said he believed \\"we are getting closer to a resolution.\\" But, he added, there seems to be a disagreement among the Taliban about the direction forward. \\"It appears at least several parties want to arbitrate captive SGT Bowe, several others ... want to keep fighting until every single Westerner is out,\\" the father said. Last year, Bergdahl's parents led the Rolling Thunder ride in Washington, and said the family holds out hope for his safe return. \\"Bowe, your family has not forgotten you, your hometown has not forgotten you. Your state of Idaho has not forgotten you, and thanks to all of you here today, Washington D.C. has not forgotten you,\\" his father told a cheering crowd. \\"We love you, we are proud of you. Stay strong, never give up. We pray for the day that we welcome you home,\\" he said. Flanked by riders wanting to offer support for the safe return of his son, Bergdahl spoke separately to CNN. He sported a long beard and wore a bandana imprinted with \\"POW.\\" His son's official status is listed as \\"missing/captured.\\" \\"The beard is a chronology,\\" Bergdahl said, \\"of my son's captivity since June 30, 2009.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Her albums include Ill Na Na in 1996, followed by Chyna Doll in 1999, and Grammy-nominated Broken Silence in 2001. While still a teenager, Brown won a talent contest in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Members of the production team Trackmasters who were working on LL Cool J's Mr. Smith album were in attendance that night and were impressed enough to invite Brown to rap over \\"I Shot Ya.\\" She followed this debut with appearances on several RIAA platinum and gold singles from other artists, including remixes of songs \\"You're Makin' Me High\\" by Toni Braxton. Brown was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film The Nutty Professor, on the songs \\"Touch Me Tease Me\\" by Case and \\"Ain't No Nigga\\" by Jay-Z. The immediate success led to a label bidding war at the beginning of 1996, and in March, Def Jam Records won and added the then 17-year-old rapper to their roster. In 1996, Foxy Brown, Lil' Kim, Da Brat, and Total got together for the recording of Bad Boy's remix of \\"No One Else\\". This was the only track that Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown appeared on together, the two were friends at the time.  In 1996, Brown released her debut album Ill Na Na to mixed reviews but strong sales. The album sold over 109,000 copies in the first week, and debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 album charts. The album was heavily produced by Trackmasters, and featured guest appearances from Jay-Z, Blackstreet, Method Man, and Kid Capri. The album went on to go platinum and launched two hit singles: \\"Get Me Home\\" (featuring Blackstreet) and \\"I'll Be\\" (featuring Jay-Z).  Following the release of Ill Na Na, Brown joined fellow New York-based hip hop artists, Nas, AZ, and Nature to form the supergroup known as The Firm. The album was released via Aftermath Records and was produced and recorded by the collective team of Dr. Dre, The Trackmasters, and Steve \\"Commissioner\\" Stoute, then of Violator Entertainment. An early form of The Firm appeared on \\"Affirmative Action\\", from Nas' second album, It Was Written. A remix of the song, and several group freestyles were in the album, Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album. The album entered the Billboard 200 album chart at #1 and sold over half a million records and is RIAA certified gold.  In March 1997, she joined the spring break festivities hosted by MTV in Panama City, Florida, among other performers including rapper Snoop Dogg, pop group The Spice Girls, and rock band Stone Temple Pilots. Later, she joined the Smokin' Grooves tour hosted by the House of Blues with the headlining rap group Cypress Hill, along with other performers like Erykah Badu, The Roots, OutKast, and The Pharcyde, the tour set to begin in Boston, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1997.

This statement seems to convey a negative opinion towards a work, event, or person. The choice of words in the sentence indicates a certain level of disappointment, annoyance, or dissatisfaction. Firstly, the word \\"earnest\\" can be seen as a positive trait, showing a genuine and sincere nature. However, in this case, we can interpret it as overly serious, trying too hard, or lacking an element of humor or lightness that may be expected. This use of \\"earnest\\" is likely to contribute negatively to the overall sentiment. Secondly, \\"unsubtle\\" hints at a lack of nuance or complexity. Someone or something described as unsubtle might be accused of failing to incorporate subtlety or intricacies which could have made it more engaging or interesting. This word clearly carries a negative connotation, implying that the subject is lacking depth or sophistication. Lastly, \\"Hollywood-predictable\\" suggests that the subject is formulaic, clich√©d, or lacking originality. This term is often used to criticize movies, stories, or events that follow well-worn tropes and storylines, neglecting to take risks or offer something fresh and innovative. This also contributes negatively to the overall sentiment of the sentence. Taking all these factors into consideration, one can conclude that the sentiment of the sentence \\"earnest, unsubtle, and Hollywood-predictable\\" is negative as it highlights dissatisfaction with the subject, implying that it is overly serious, lacking depth, and unoriginal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Douglas Richard Flutie (born October 23, 1962) is a former quarterback in the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL), and United States Football League (USFL). Flutie first rose to prominence during his college football career at Boston College, where he received the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in 1984. His \\"Hail Flutie\\" touchdown pass in a game against Miami on November 23, 1984 (dubbed \\"The Pass\\") is considered among the greatest moments in college football and American sports history. Flutie was selected as the 285th pick in the 11th round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, making him the lowest drafted Heisman Award winner among those who were drafted. Context: Flutie played football for Boston College, the only Division I-A school to recruit him, from 1981 to 1984, and won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in his senior year (1984). Flutie became the first quarterback to win the Heisman since Pat Sullivan in 1971. Flutie left school as the NCAA's all-time passing yardage leader with 10,579 yards and was a consensus All-American as a senior. He earned Player of the Year awards from UPI, Kodak, The Sporting News, and the Maxwell Football Club. The quarterback coach for Boston College from 1981 - 1983 was Tom Coughlin.  Flutie gained national attention in 1984 when he led the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45-41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a \\"Hail Mary pass\\" that was caught in the end zone by Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47-45 win. Flutie won the Heisman trophy a week later, but the voting had finished before the game; Flutie said, however, that \\"without the Hail Mary pass I think I could have been very easily forgotten\\".  The subsequent rise in applications for admission to Boston College after Flutie's \\"Hail Mary\\" gave rise to the admissions phenomenon known as the \\"Flutie Effect\\". This idea essentially states that a winning sports team can increase the recognition value of a school enough to make it more attractive to potential applicants.  In addition to his collegiate athletic achievement, Flutie maintained a distinguished academic record at Boston College. He was a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship, for which he was named a finalist in 1984. Upon graduating, Flutie won a National Football Foundation post-graduate scholarship.  In November 2008, Flutie was honored by Boston College with a statue of him throwing his famous \\"Hail Mary\\" pass outside of Alumni Stadium. His number, 22, has been retired by the Boston College football program.  Despite his successful college achievements, whether Flutie was too small to play professional football was uncertain. When asked on television \\"Can a guy who's five-foot-nine, 175 pounds make it in the pros?\\", he answered \\"Yes, he can. But it's a matter of ability and not size. I feel I can play; I don't know for sure, and those questions will be answered in the future.\\"  Flutie was seen as extremely attractive to the USFL, which was desperate for a star to reinvigorate the league as it was in financial difficulty. Meanwhile, the Buffalo Bills, who had the first pick of the 1985 NFL Draft, still had the rights to Jim Kelly (who had earlier spurned them to go to the USFL) and also had concerns about Flutie's height. He was selected by the USFL's New Jersey Generals (owned by Donald Trump) in the 1985 territorial draft, which took place in January, months before the 1985 NFL Draft. Flutie went through negotiations with Trump and agreed on a deal that would make him the highest paid pro football player and highest paid rookie in any sport with 7 million over 5 years; Flutie was officially signed on February 4, 1985. Having already signed with the USFL, Flutie was not selected in the NFL Draft until the 11th round, and the 285th overall pick by the Los Angeles Rams.  Flutie entered the USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many began to wonder if the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, as his first two professional passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, for a total of 174 yards, while running for 51 yards. Flutie completed 134 of 281 passes for 2,109 yards and 13 touchdowns with the Generals in 1985 in 15 games. He suffered an injury late in the season that saw him turn over the reins to reserve quarterback Ron Reeves. The Generals went on to sport an 11-7 record and a 2nd-place finish in the USFL's Eastern Conference. The USFL folded in 1986, and Flutie and punter Sean Landeta were the league's last active players in the NFL.  Flutie played in the Canadian Football League for 8 years. He is considered as one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to play Canadian football. In 1990, he signed with the BC Lions for a two-year contract reportedly worth 350,000 a season. At the time he was the highest paid player in the CFL. Flutie struggled in his first season, which would be his only losing season in the CFL. Over the next seven years he would go 99-27 as a starter. In his second season, he threw for a record 6,619 yards on 466 completions. Flutie was rewarded with a reported million-dollar salary with the Calgary Stampeders.  Flutie won his first Grey Cup in 1992 with the Stampeders. He was named the Grey Cup MVP.  During his last years in Calgary, Flutie's backup was Jeff Garcia, who later went on to start for the NFL's San Francisco 49ers. Flutie won two more Grey Cups with the Toronto Argonauts, in 1996 (The Snow Bowl, held in Hamilton, Ontario) and 1997 (held in Edmonton, Alberta), before signing with the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in 1998. Prior to his final two Grey Cup victories with the Argonauts, Flutie was hampered by the opinion, supported by the media, that he was a quarterback who could not win in cold weather. In both 1993 and 1994, the Stampeders had the best record in the league, but lost the Western Final each year at home in freezing conditions. After first refusing to wear gloves in freezing temperatures, in later years Flutie adapted to throwing with gloves in cold weather.  His career CFL statistics include 41,355 passing yards and 270 touchdowns. He holds the professional football record of 6,619 yards passing in a single season. He led the league in passing five times in only eight seasons. He once held four of the CFL's top five highest single-season completion marks, including a record 466 in 1991 which was surpassed by Ricky Ray in 2005. His 48 touchdown passes in 1994 remains a CFL record. He earned three Grey Cup MVP awards, and was named the CFL's Most Outstanding Player a record six times (1991-1994, and 1996-1997). He passed for 5,000+ yards six times in his career and remains the only player in pro football history to pass for 6,000+ yards in a season twice in his career.  On November 17, 2006, Flutie was named the greatest Canadian Football League player of all time from a top 50 list of CFL players conducted by TSN. In 2007, he was named to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, the first non-Canadian to be inducted. Question: When did he start in Canada. Whats the answer?","output":"Douglas Richard Flutie started his professional football career in Canada in the year 1990. This information is inferred from the text that states \\"In 1990, he signed with the BC Lions for a two-year contract reportedly worth 350,000 a season.\\"  I arrived at this answer by scanning through the provided text for relevant information about when Flutie began playing football in Canada.

The method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death penalty, the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution. For offenses under the Drug Kingpin Act of 1988, the method of execution is lethal injection. The Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana is currently the home of the only death chamber for federal death penalty recipients in the United States, where inmates are put to death by lethal injection. The complex has so far been the only location used for federal executions post-Gregg. Timothy McVeigh and Juan Garza were put to death in June 2001, and Louis Jones, Jr. was put to death on March 18, 2003.
