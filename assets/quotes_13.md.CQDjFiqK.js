The first sentence suggests that someone might be storing their personal belongings with the intention of retrieving them once the war ends, perhaps to keep their possessions safe or avoid losing them during the conflict. This idea is based on a personal motivation to protect one's belongings. On the other hand, the second sentence implies that someone might have been storing items with the intention of profiting from them after the war. This reason is focused on making a financial gain by taking advantage of the post-war situation.  Since these two motivations are different, it is not possible to determine the truth of the second sentence based solely on the truth of the first sentence.

Společná azylová politika by měla zahrnovat harmonizaci právních předpisů a postupů v oblasti azylu, posílení ochrany žadatelů a uznání jejich práv, zajištění přístupu k azylovým řízením, zlepšení podmínek pro začlenění uprchlíků a posílení spolupráce mezi členskými státy a mezinárodními organizacemi, jako je UNHCR.

To by mohlo zahrnovat zvýšení počtu přesídlení uprchlíků z třetích zemí do členských států EU, zlepšení podmínek pro rodinnou reunifikaci nebo usnadnění uplatňování zvláštních opatření pro zranitelné skupiny uprchlíků, jako jsou děti a osoby s omezenou schopností pracovat. Kromě toho by ERF II měl usilovat o zlepšení spolupráce s třetími zeměmi, zejména s oblastech předcházení nucené migraci, posilování kapacit pro řízení azylu a migrace, zvyšování účinnosti repatriace a podpory spolupráce s mezinárodními organizacemi, jako je IOM a UNHCR. A konečně, ERF II by se měl zaměřit na posílení rozhodovacích procesů a provádění azylových politik na evropské úrovni, například prostřednictvím jednotného azylového postupu a společného přezkoumání rozhodnutí o udělení azylu.

The answer is:","output":"No.  Based on the provided review, it is clear that the user would not recommend this product for the AT&T Tilt. The essential factor leading to this dissatisfaction is the incompatibility of the product with the AT&T Tilt model. The screen protector - which is highlighted as scratch-resistant - was too large for the user’s device's screen.  This aspect is critical since the improper fit of the screen does not only diminish the aesthetic appeal but also affects the functionality of the device. Usually, when a screen protector is larger than the screen, it leaves unwanted edges hanging over the sides, which can interfere with the phone's case or any other accessories that might be used in conjunction with the phone. These edges could also easily peel off, thereby compromising the protection the screen protector is supposed to offer. Moreover, the review mentions that the product is too large, but does not stipulate whether the screen protector can be trimmed down to fit. However, even if it could be trimmed, it demands additional effort from the user, which could be an inconvenience.  Moreover, a screen protector's primary purpose is to protect the screen from scratches and other potential damage. If it does not fit appropriately, it cannot perform its primary function, which eventually defeats its purpose.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: HO Old/Reuters      Teenage heartthrob Justin Bieber continues to draw ire after his visit to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam on Friday. After noting in the museum’s guestbook how “inspiring” it was to visit the home where Frank and her family hid from the Nazis for two years during World War II, he went on to opine that she “was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.” Staff posted Bieber’s note to the museum’s Facebook page, prompting many to “cringe at the insensitivity and the sheer ego of” the counterfactual fan club invitation. Frank died in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, so there is no way of knowing whether she would have enjoyed the nuanced strains of “Baby.” However, in addition to being one of the most important chroniclers of her time, Anne Frank was also a normal teenager. Was she a fan of pop culture?      Somewhat. A few clues on this front can be found in the famous diary itself. In one of the earliest entries, dated Sunday, June 14, 1942, Frank imagines what it would be like to own a pet like Rin Tin Tin and writes of her and her classmates’ enjoyment of a movie featuring the dog on the occasion of her birthday party, a few weeks before the family was forced into hiding. Frank was also fond of the young adult novels of her era, particularly the books of Cissy van Marxveldt: “I’ve read The Zaniest Summer four times, and the ludicrous situations still make me laugh.” In these preferences, Frank was like most girls her age.      Musically speaking, though, Frank’s tastes seem to have run highbrow. Along with the rest of her family, she enjoyed listening to classical music in private home performances before the war and later on the radio, and devotes much of a June 1944 entry to a loose review of a biography of Franz Liszt. Classical music also played into Frank’s nascent romantic life: “Sunday afternoon Peter came to see me at four-thirty, at my invitation.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What is a reason to work with used materials during manufacturing?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"recycling reduces the resources needed to make something\\" and \\"recycling is the reuse of material\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","output":"Working with used materials during manufacturing is beneficial mainly because it promotes recycling, which in turn reduces the consumption of natural resources and encourages the reuse of materials. By utilizing recycled materials in the production process, manufacturers can significantly cut down on the extraction and processing of raw materials, which often leads to decreased energy consumption and lower environmental impact. Moreover, recycling contributes to a more sustainable and circular economy, as it minimizes waste generation and promotes a more efficient use of available resources. As a result, manufacturing sectors can enjoy various benefits such as cost savings, improved resource management, and better risk mitigation due to reduced dependency on virgin materials. Another crucial advantage of using recycled materials during manufacturing is the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Since the extraction and processing of raw materials often require energy-intensive practices, incorporating recycled materials lessens the need for these activities. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions associated with production can be considerably reduced, which is a significant step towards combating climate change. Lastly, working with used materials can yield social and economic benefits. As recycling creates new job opportunities and supports local industries engaged in the reuse and recycling of materials, it fosters a more diversified and resilient economy that values sustainability and resource efficiency. In conclusion, the best answer to the question is: Incorporating used materials during manufacturing is essential because it supports recycling, which leads to reduced resource consumption, decreased energy use, lower environmental impact, and the fostering of a more sustainable and circular economy. This not only aids in combating climate change but also generates positive social and economic outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: For autosomal dominant disorders, a person with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing on the gene to their offspring. For achondroplasia, this means there will be a 50% chance that each child will have achondroplasia. Since two copies are fatal, if two people with achondroplasia have a child, there is a 25% chance of the child dying shortly after birth, a 50% chance the child will have achondroplasia, and a 25% chance the child will have a normal phenotype. However, in 3 out of 4 cases, people with achondroplasia are born to parents who don't have the condition. This is the result of a new mutation. New achondroplasis mutations are associated with increasing paternal age (over 35 years). Studies have demonstrated that new gene mutations are exclusively inherited from the father and occur during spermatogenesis. More than 98% of achondroplasia is caused by a G to A point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the FGFR3 gene, which causes a glycine to arginine substitution. This makes this particular nucleotide one of the most, if not the most, mutable base in the human genome.  and the situation: Erin was born with achondroplasia. When this was found out her parents got tested fur the mutation and neither of them had it, As of today she is very concerned because she would like to he children.  Answer the following question: Will a baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia have a higher or lower chance of survival shortly after birth? A:","output":"A baby born to parents that both have achondroplasia will have a lower chance of survival shortly after birth compared to a baby born to parents where only one or neither parent has achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, there is a 25% chance that their child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent), leading to a severe and usually fatal condition known as homozygous achondroplasia. In this case, the baby is likely to die shortly after birth due to complications from the disorder. If only one parent has achondroplasia, the chances of the child inheriting the condition are lower (50% chance of inheriting achondroplasia and 50% chance of not). When neither parent has achondroplasia, the chances of the child being born with the condition due to a new mutation are even lower, as 3 out of 4 cases occur in children born to parents without the condition. Therefore, when both parents have achondroplasia, the overall chance of survival for their baby shortly after birth is lower compared to cases where one or neither parent has the disorder, due to the higher risk of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

To do this, teachers and actually everyone else in a community, should play a role as a \\"cognitive coach\\" to students, helping develop good thinkers among our youth. The best way for you to become a cognitive coach is to seek out and engage school children and adolescents in meaningful conversations. The objective here is to get kids talking about what they think, how they feel, and what they believe whenever and wherever you may find them. It may be in a classroom. It may be at the grocery store. It may be at a basketball game. It doesn't matter where as long as you engage students in a topical conversation and, hopefully, even a debate. Mainly, you want to encourage students to voice their opinion about things. Get them to take a position on \\"this thing, or that thing,\\" and ask them to support their position with evidence. Curiously enough, the simple process of engaging students in real life conversations and debates will serve to strengthen what they have learned in the classroom, and help them create their own knowledge about a subject or a topic. Learning indicates that a student has been exposed to material, understands the material, and can recall the information. Knowledge, on the other hand, goes beyond recall and includes information processing, application to other situations, consideration of meaning, and contrasting with other concepts. Naturally, the topic of conversation you engage in with one of your learners will differ from student to student, and in the level of complexity based on child's age and developmental level.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who put the bible in verses Suggested answer: Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. in Hebrew Bibles is numbered as in Christian translations. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"It seems like the suggested answer isn't clear and comprehensive enough. I would not validate this answer. Here's a more detailed response that might be more helpful: The process of dividing the Bible into chapters and verses happened over time and involved several individuals. The Bible consists of two main parts: the Old Testament, which is primarily based on Hebrew scriptures, and the New Testament, consisting of early Christian writings. The division of these texts into chapters and verses was not part of the original writings but was introduced later for easier navigation, referencing, and study. The division of the Old Testament into chapters and verses can be attributed to several sources. Around the 10th century CE, Jewish scholars known as the Masoretes began introducing divisions into the Hebrew text. They divided the text into verses based on the natural syntax and meaning in each sentence. They also introduced spaces between sections, known as parashot or sedarim, which aided in reading. As for the New Testament, the division into chapters is credited to Stephen Langton, an Archbishop of Canterbury, in the early 13th century CE. Langton's chapter divisions, which followed a similar purpose to the Masoretic divisions, gained widespread acceptance and were later integrated into Hebrew and Latin versions of the Old Testament. The division of the New Testament and the Hebrew Old Testament into verses can be credited to Robert Estienne (also known as Robertus Stephanus), a French printer and classical scholar. Estienne introduced the verse numbering system in the 1550s while working on publishing the Greek New Testament and the Latin version of the Old Testament. He sought to produce an easy-to-reference edition of the Bible that could be used for printing comparative texts. His numbering system gained rapid acceptance and soon became a standard way to reference and study the Bible. In summary, the division of the Bible into chapters and verses was a gradual process involving the efforts of multiple scholars and publishers. The Masoretes contributed to the initial verses and divisions of the Hebrew Old Testament, Stephen Langton introduced the chapters in the early 13th century CE, and Robert Estienne later refined the system by adding the verse numbers in the 16th century CE. This system has been used worldwide, facilitating scholarly study and discussion of the Bible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth.  Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in England than in Nicaragua?  Hint: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" Answer:","output":"In light of the provided information regarding the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions, it can be inferred that the ecosystem functions in England would be less stable as compared to those in Nicaragua. Nicaragua, with its abundant biodiversity including hundreds of bird species and thousands of plant species, would have a more efficient, stable, and productive ecosystem. The high levels of biodiversity contribute to efficient resource capture, biomass production, decomposition, and nutrient recycling processes essential for maintaining stability in the ecological community. On the other hand, England has suffered a significant decline in biodiversity due to centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls. As a result, its ecosystem functions are less stable and efficient. Decreased biodiversity leads to less efficient resource capture, reduced biomass production, and a decline in the decomposition and nutrient recycling processes that are crucial for maintaining stability in the ecosystem. Moreover, diverse ecosystems are more resilient to environmental changes, as they contain key species with varying functional traits that aid in resource capture and contribute to overall productivity. Due to the loss of biodiversity, the impacts on the ecosystem processes in England might be substantial, making them less stable and on par with the effects of other global environmental drivers. In summary, the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua are likely more stable and efficient compared to those in England, primarily due to the higher levels of biodiversity in the Central American country. Such biodiversity helps in maintaining crucial ecological processes, which in turn, contributes to the overall resilience and stability of the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Atlantic coast of the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast-southwest trend to crustal deformations which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea. During what geological period did the Appalachian mountains reach their highest formation point? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The Appalachian Mountains are believed to have reached their highest formation point during the Permian period. The Permian period is a geologic time period that occurred about 298.9 million to about 252.2 million years ago. It was during this time that there was a significant amount of crustal deformation that led to the creation of this mountain system.  The term \\"climax of deformation\\" indicates the time when the structural formation and compositional changes in a geographical entity, like the Appalachian mountains, reached their peak level of intense change or activity. According to the information provided, it's inferred that the highest formation point of the Appalachian mountains was during the Permian time due to this \\"climax of deformation.\\"  However, it should be noted that these mountains are very old and have experienced many periods of uplift and erosion. Significant changes to the current height of the Appalachian mountain system were likely caused by a combination of crustal deformations, continued elevation along earlier deformation lines, and the survival of resistant rocks which persisted as residual mountains. Furthermore, more recent geological activities, such as crustal movements and changes in sea levels also played part in shaping the Appalachians. So, while the Permian period represents a pivotal epoch when the Appalachian Mountains were formed and probably reached their highest peak, the mountains' present-day features are the result of millions of years of geological activity and processes beyond the Permian period. Consequently, they have been reduced to moderate or low relief in the present day. Thus, while the highest formation point can be traced back to the Permian period, the evolution of the Appalachian mountain system is the product of multiple geological periods and varied earth movements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The last party congress was held in 1980, during which Kim Jong-un’s father - Kim Jong-il - was confirmed as the successor to the state’s founder, Kim Il-sung.      Kim, 33, who is already the country’s supreme leader, is expected to use the congress to cement his leadership, declare North Korea a nuclear state and outline his vision for the nation’s economic and military future.      The party’s official newspaper, said: “The [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] proudly joined the ranks of advanced nuclear and space powers while demonstrating the might of the invincible politico-ideological, military and youth power and is now dashing ahead toward to a socialist economic power and highly civilised nation.”      In March, the UN Security Council approved its toughest sanctions yet on the nation, with an aim to withhold funds being used to finance the state’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, following a series of military tests this year.      The sanctions have added to the socialist dynasty’s economic turmoil. Following the vote, US ambassador Samantha Power explained, “Virtually all of the DPRK's resources are channelled into its reckless and relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.”      Speaking in New York ahead of a UN climate change conference, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Su-yong told reporters the economy remained at the forefront of the congress.      He said: “One of the most important things through this party congress is to show to the entire world the union of our people. I'm sure our country will be even more vibrant after the party congress to build up a more prosperous and powerful, economically sound nation.      “The first thing is to advance the pace of economic building for a powerful nation. The second is to improve the people's living standards and to find the best, optimum ways to improve the people's living standards under these circumstances, and the third, to strengthen our national defence capabilities.      “The real source of power in our country isn't nuclear weapons or any other military means, but the single-minded unity of the people and the leader. This power of unity we have is the real source of power that leads our country into victory.\\"      North Korea propaganda video depicts imagined attack on Washington      The congress is likely to last four or five days.      It follows a 70-day “loyalty drive” which has seen members of the country’s workforce put in extra hours to increase productivity and show their devotion to the leader and the Worker’s Party of Korea.

Each year, the American-based group honors environmental activists from six different areas. The first three winners of the 2012 Goldman Prize are from Kenya, the Philippines and China.  The Goldman Environmental Foundation says Ikal Angelei is a hero to those who live around Lake Turkana. The Kenyan woman received the award because of her efforts to stop a dam project on a river in Ethiopia. Critics say the dam will harm the lake and restrict   the flow of water for people who live nearby.  The Philippine island of Mindoro is home to those who depend on the area's natural resources for food and jobs. Edwin Gariguez became concerned when a European company announced plans to mine for nickel   on the island. The Roman Catholic minister said waste materials from the mining project would pollute the water and destroy the forests. So he started a campaign to stop the project. In China, Ma June is working with businesses to clean up their pollution. He formed a group that collects information about pollution, and publishes it on the Internet.

You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Input: Background Paragraph: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.  Story: Andy is participating in this years science fair. He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust.  Question: Will making the surface area of iron larger increase or decrease how fast it rusts? Output:","output":"Part #1: Understand causal or qualitative relationships in background paragraph. Usage: Increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. The nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. This shows that the larger surface area causes a faster rusting reaction between the iron and oxygen in the air. Part #2: Understand the story with the concepts of the background paragraph. Usage: Andy's experiment shows that the sheet, with a larger surface area, rusts in 2 days, and the cube, with a smaller surface area, takes a week to rust. The cylinder, with a surface area between that of the cube and sheet, takes 4 days to rust. This demonstrates the concept of larger surface areas leading to faster rusting. Part #3: Answer the given question using the understanding of the relationship and the story. Usage: Will making the surface area of iron larger increase or decrease how fast it rusts? Answer: increase. It meets the criteria because, as shown in both the background paragraph and Andy's experiment, larger surface areas lead to faster rusting as more of the solid substance is exposed to other reactants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland.    What entity does 'bob mendes' has the relation 'country of citizenship' with?

A team of researchers at Ohio State University, US, has found sad movies can make people happier, Science Daily reported last month. Many people find tragedies make them realize how good their own lives are, the study showed. \\"People seem to use tragedies as a way to reflect on the important relationships in their own lives,\\" said Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, leader of the study. \\"Tragic stories often focus on themes of eternal  love, and this leads viewers to think about their loved ones and count their good and helpful things.\\" In the study, researchers gathered 361 college students and showed them the 2007 movie, Alonement. The movie is about two lovers who are separated  and finally die during Worid War II. Before and after the movie, the students were asked questions measuring  how happy they were with their lives. Researchers also asked them before, afier and three times during the movie to measure various emotions, including sadness.

This is because experiencing negative emotions such as sadness during a tragic movie prompts individuals to think more critically about their own life situations, ultimately leading them to reflect on and appreciate their close relationships. In contrast, positive emotions tend to signal that everything is fine and leave people feeling less inclined to contemplate their life and relationships more deeply. This phenomenon has ancient roots, as even the ancient Greeks recognized the link between the feeling of happiness that arises after witnessing sadness, which they called \\"catharsis\\".

Q: Women with menstrual cramps in New York state could have a new option for easing their monthly pains: medical marijuana.      The New York State Assembly is considering a bill to add dysmenorrhea — the medical name for menstrual cramps — to the list of conditions for which doctors can legally authorize a patient to use medical marijuana. Under the state's law, only patients with the specific medical conditions named in the law can access medical marijuana in New York, according to Newsweek. Cancer, HIV and multiple sclerosis are among the conditions already on the list.      Severe cases of dysmenorrhea can be \\"debilitating,\\" New York State Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal wrote in the bill. \\"Medical marijuana can alleviate many of the painful effects of dysmenorrhea.\\" [Healing Herb? Marijuana Could Treat These 5 Conditions]      The bill, which still has several legislative hurdles to overcome, is supported by actress Whoopi Goldberg, who sells a line of medical marijuana products that are marketed specifically for period pain, Newsweek reported.      But does marijuana really help with menstrual pain?      There haven't been any rigorous studies that have shown that there's a benefit to using marijuana for menstrual cramps, said Dr. Charles Pollack, an emergency-medicine physician at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia and the director of the university's Lambert Center for the Study of Medicinal Cannabis and Hemp.      And though there are good data showing that marijuana can help people with neuropathic pain, the pain from menstrual cramps doesn't fall into this category, Pollack said. Neuropathic pain is pain related to the nerves, such as a pinched or inflamed nerve.      That said, \\"it's not out of the realm of the possible\\" that the drug could be helpful for women with menstrual cramps, Pollack told Live Science.      This is because the female reproductive tract, and, in particular, the uterus and the lining of the uterus, has an \\"abundance\\" of endocannabinoid receptors, Pollack said. The chemicals in marijuana that are responsible for its effects in the body are called cannabinoids, and can bind to these receptors.      The discovery of these receptors, for example, has led to some researchers thinking that marijuana may help women with endometriosis, Pollack said. Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which the tissue that normally lines a woman's uterus, called the endometrium, grows outside the uterus, the Mayo Clinic says. One area of research is considering whether marijuana may help both with easing the pain of endometriosis and slowing the growth of endometrial tissue, Pollack said.      It's also possible that women with painful menstrual cramps benefit from the anxiolytic, or anti-anxiety, effects of marijuana, Pollack added.      But because of the lack of data, it's difficult to draw conclusions about the drug's effects. \\"There's just a paucity of data in this regard,\\" Pollack said. And the drug may have downsides: Although it's \\"exceedingly unlikely\\" that someone will die from an overdose of marijuana, there are still questions about the possible effects of regular, long-term use, he said.      Dr. Ranit Mishori, a professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine, told Live Science in 2016 that, \\"with the exception of a study in 1800s, I see no evidence in the medical literature that supports\\" the use of marijuana for menstrual cramps.      Although there are barriers to studying marijuana in the U.S., \\"the alternative isn't to recommend a treatment in the absence of evidence,\\" Mishori said.      Originally published on Live Science. ||||| The pain creeps in slow and unexpectedly. Initially, it’s a subtle discomfort, like the prick of a needle stabbing away at your stomach. As the minutes pass by, the discomfort can develop into a crippling pain, making even simple tasks such as standing up straight seem utterly unbearable.      That dreadful feeling has a name: Dysmenorrhea—the medical term for severe period pain commonly referred to as cramps. And it’s something experienced every month by hundreds of women all across America.      While over the counter medicine like Midol can be helpful for many women, some 20 percent of women who suffer from cramps caused by their menstrual cycles each month experience such extreme dysmenorrhea that they can’t perform daily actives like getting out of bed and going to work, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians.      Now, relief may soon be on the way. The New York Assembly's Health Committee passed an initiative Tuesday that would add dysmenorrhea to the list of conditions necessary to qualify for medical marijuana use. If it becomes law, everyday women suffering from intolerable period pain could have legal access to pot with a medical marijuana card.      “This is a woman’s health issue and for years women have suffered in silence. There’s Midol. You can take Advil, but really nothing more,” Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, a Democrat, who introduced the bill, told Newsweek during a phone call Wednesday. “Men have really been [the ones] who’ve run state houses, governorships, presidencies, and some issues that are just about women have gotten shortchanged and that’s because it’s not in men’s everyday consciousness.”      The measure, called Assembly Bill 582, was approved in a 21-2 vote by the committee and it’s headed to the Assembly floor next. It would also need the OK from the New York Senate and Governor Andrew Cuomo.      The bill’s only pushback so far came from two Republican Assembly members—both men—but Rosenthal is confident that members of the Senate would be more understanding of how helpful medical marijuana, a drug that people suffering from various types of chronic pain can legally use in New York, can be for women during menstruation, too.      “There is some mild discomfort for some, but some women can’t leave their bed for a week,” Rosenthal said. “People are starting to understand that medical marijuana is a useful tool to relieve suffering and women’s suffering from severe menstrual cramps.”      In New York, only people suffering from cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, Huntington's disease or chronic pain can get access to medical marijuana—not everyday women who naturally have periods and experience the pain that sometimes comes along with it each month.      Rosenthal has become known as a champion for women’s issues. She worked last year to get a bill that removed sales taxes on feminine hygiene products signed into New York law, and she’s at the helm of passing another bill that would make feminine hygiene products free for women in prisons, homeless shelters and schools. For Assembly Bill 582, she is getting some extra help from a highly regarded medical marijuana advocate, who just so happens to be a well-known movie star and co-host of the daytime talk show, The View.      “I met with a force of a woman named Whoopi Goldberg, and she’s been a longtime expert on medical marijuana. I met with her and spoke with her, and she’s been passionate about easing women’s suffering by using medical marijuana,” Rosenthal said. “I thought this was a great opportunity to create an impact with a passionate supporter and help women access something new that can help relieve what cripples some of them during that time of the month.”      Goldberg introduced her own line of medical cannabis products in 2016 to combat menstrual pain with cannabis industry leader Maya Elisabeth. Under their Whoopi & Maya brand, women in legal marijuana states are able to receive pain relief with a cannabis bath soak, cannabidiol (CBD) and beeswax-infused body balm and organic and raw cocoa infused with either THC or CBD.      Although the bill has a few more steps to go before women could potentially be prescribed medical marijuana for cramps in New York, Rosenthal said the high support so far for the measure is a good sign it could pass into legislation.      “I think we’re a progressive state. It did take 20 years to get medical marijuana to be the law,” she said,” but we’re going to work hard to get it passed.”      “And I’m sure many women will vouch for what they have to go through each month.” ||||| Dysmenorrhea may begin soon after menarche, where it often improves with age, or it may originate later in life after the onset of an underlying causative condition.      Dysmenorrhea is very common, and it may be severe enough to interfere with daily activities in up to 20 percent of women.      Dysmenorrhea is more likely in women who smoke, and in women with an earlier age at menarche or longer duration of menstruation.      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce moderate to severe pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea compared with placebo, but we do not know whether any one nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is superior to the others.      Simple analgesics such as aspirin and paracetamol may reduce pain in the short term, although few studies have been of good quality.      The Chinese herbal remedy toki-shakuyaku-san and an Iranian herbal remedy made from saffron, celery, and anise may reduce pain compared with placebo. We do not know whether Chinese herbal remedies are beneficial compared with placebo, but there is limited evidence that they may be effective compared with other treatments for dysmenorrhea.      Thiamine and vitamin E may reduce pain compared with placebo in young women with primary dysmenorrhea.      Combined oral contraceptives may be more effective at reducing pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea; however, few studies have been of good quality.      Topical heat (about 102°F [39°C]) may be as effective as ibuprofen and more effective than paracetamol at reducing pain.      High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may reduce pain compared with sham treatment, but seems to be less effective than ibuprofen.      Acupressure may be more effective than sham or no treatment at relieving dysmenorrhea.      Spinal manipulation may be no more effective than placebo at reducing pain after one month in women with primary dysmenorrhea.      Relaxation may be better than no treatment at relieving dysmenorrhea.      We do not know whether acupuncture, fish oil, vitamin B 12 , magnets, or intrauterine progestogens reduce dysmenorrhea.      Surgical interruption of pelvic nerve pathways is not beneficial in treating dysmenorrhea, and may be associated with adverse effects including constipation.

It is commonly divided into primary dysmenorrhea (pain without organic pathology) and secondary dysmenorrhea (pelvic pain associated with an identifiable pathologic condition, such as endometriosis or ovarian cysts). The initial onset of primary dysmenorrhea usually occurs within six to 12 months after menarche, when ovulatory cycles are established. Pain duration is commonly eight to 72 hours and is usually associated with the onset of menstrual flow. Secondary dysmenorrhea can also occur at any time after menarche, but may arise as a new symptom during a woman's fourth and fifth decades, after the onset of an underlying causative condition. In this review we only consider studies of women with primary dysmenorrhea. However, the results may also be generalizable to women with secondary dysmenorrhea. Studies of women with endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic congestion, and fibroids may also examine dysmenorrhea/pain as an outcome.      Incidence and Prevalence Variations in the definition of dysmenorrhea make it difficult to determine precise prevalence rates. Studies tend to report on prevalence in adolescent girls, and the type of dysmenorrhea is not always specified. Adolescent girls tend to have a higher prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea than older women, because primary dysmenorrhea can improve with age (see Prognosis). Secondary dysmenorrhea rates may be lower in adolescents, because onset of causative conditions may not yet have occurred. Therefore, the results from prevalence studies of adolescents may not always be extrapolated to older women, or be accurate estimates of the prevalence of secondary dysmenorrhea. However, various types of studies have found a consistently high prevalence in women of different ages and nationalities. One systematic review (search date 1996) of the prevalence of chronic pelvic pain, summarizing community and hospital surveys from developed countries, estimated prevalence to be 45 to 95 percent. A second systematic review of studies in developing countries (search date 2002) found that 25 to 50 percent of adult women, and about 75 percent of adolescents, experienced pain with menstruation, with 5 to 20 percent reporting severe dysmenorrhea or pain that prevents them from participating in their usual activities. A third systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence rates among high-quality studies with samples representative of the general worldwide population (search date 2004) found that prevalence of dysmenorrhea was 59 percent (95% confidence interval, 49 to 71 percent). Prevalence rates reported in the United Kingdom were between 45 and 97 percent for any dysmenorrhea in community-based studies, and between 41 and 62 percent in hospital-based studies.      Etiology and Risk Factors A systematic review (search date 2004) of cohort and case-control studies concluded that age younger than 30 years, low body mass index, smoking, earlier menarche (younger than 12 years), longer menstrual cycles, heavy menstrual flow, nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, sterilization, clinically suspected pelvic inflammatory disease, sexual abuse, and psychological symptoms were associated with increased risk of dysmenorrhea. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

It didn't take me long to figure out where I had made the wrong turn. I had tried following my memory instead of Luna's directions and wound up about eighty miles off course. My gas tank was pushing 'E' but fortunately the service station was open. When I stepped out of my Jeep, I could feel the soles of my boots melt on the asphalt. The heat coming off the cracked and pitted cement peeled off in waves that rolled out in every endless direction. The barren mountains in the distance looked unstable, like I was looking at them through a window pane slicked with olive oil. I slogged my way over to the gas pump and wrapped my shirt around the handle to keep my skin from burning against the desert-baked metal. The heat was so great I worried the fumes would ignite. A dirty round man stood in the shadowy doorway of the ramshackle service station and stared at me while he rubbed his hands inside an oily red rag. The oval name-patch stitched to his coveralls was loose at one end and curled like a leaf in the heat. His name was Jack. I topped off the tank and then walked over to him. \\"You work here?\\" I knew it was a stupid question the second it left my mouth. He and I were the only living things for fifty miles in any direction. Who the hell else would be working here? \\"Who the hell else would be working here?\\" he said.

Danny Cevallos: Arrests over tweets threatening NYPD raise issue of when speech is threat. He says Supreme Court to weigh in soon. Maybe it's time to draw threat line at social media. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: When Does Speech Become a Threat? Supreme Court to Weigh in on Social Media's Role  Introduction In today's digital age, social media has become an essential platform for expression and free speech, granting individuals the ability to voice their thoughts and opinions with ease. However, the growing trend of arrests over threatening tweets directed at the New York Police Department raises questions about the boundary between protected speech and criminal threats. Legal analyst Danny Cevallos observes that the Supreme Court's upcoming involvement in clarifying this line might redefine the way we perceive threats within social media spaces. Arrests Over Threatening Tweets Over recent years, there have been multiple instances of individuals being arrested for posting threatening messages on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, targeting the NYPD. For many, these cases evoke questions about whether such arrests infringe upon First Amendment rights to free speech. A delicate balance must exist between protecting individuals' rights to freedom of expression and ensuring public safety against credible threats, especially in evolving digital environments. The Supreme Court Weighs In To address this legal conundrum, the Supreme Court has decided to weigh in on the issue, providing much-needed clarity on the distinction between protected speech and criminal threats in the context of social media. The Court's decision will be crucial in defining the parameters within which threats on social media will be viewed as punishable offenses under U.S. law. This judgment has the potential to act as a legal precedent for future cases involving threats made through digital communication platforms. Drawing the 'Threat Line' on Social Media The imminent Supreme Court decision highlights the importance of establishing a defined 'threat line' on social media platforms. By doing so, legal systems can better account for the intricacies of online communication, ensuring that First Amendment rights are duly safeguarded while simultaneously upholding necessary protection against dangerous threats. The outcome of the Supreme Court's involvement will not only impact the American legal landscape but may also influence the strategies implemented by social media companies in regulating harmful content. Conclusion As the boundaries of human communication blur with the advancements of digital technology, the clarity on the distinction between free speech and threats has become essential to uphold individual liberties and maintain public safety. The Supreme Court's decision on the matter will offer much-needed guidance on navigating this gray area within the realm of social media. By adequately delineating the line between protected speech and punishable threats, the Court's intervention has the potential to shape the way in which authorities and social media platforms approach and manage threatening content online. In this rapidly evolving digital era, it is crucial to strike a fair balance between ensuring the protection of fundamental rights while mitigating the potential harm that may arise from dangerous threats made within virtual spaces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Adam Mitchel Lambert (born January 29, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter and stage actor. Since 2009, he has sold over 3 million albums and 5 million singles worldwide. Lambert rose to fame in 2009 after finishing as runner-up on the eighth season of American Idol. Later that year, he released his debut album, For Your Entertainment, which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. Critics, celebrities and colleagues have been outspoken in their praise for Lambert's vocal command. Kathie Bretches-Urban, co-founder of Metropolitan Educational Theatre Network (now MET2) where Lambert performed as a youth, said \\"He has invested his entire life in music and performing ... He'd just come out onstage, and it popped\\". Record producer Rob Cavallo once described Lambert as having an unlimited range, and able to sing every note on a guitar from the lowest to the highest. In a March 2012 interview, rock artist Meat Loaf rated Lambert's voice in the company of only two others, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, based on \\"that jet pack quality to their voice that just lets it take off.\\" Lambert's total recorded vocal range spans from bass E to B flat above tenor high C (E2 - B5), giving him three octaves and six semitones.  In 2011, when he took the stage at the MTV Europe Music Awards, honoree Queen guitarist Brian May noted that Lambert's voice has \\"sensitivity, depth, maturity, and awesome range and power which will make jaws drop\\"; while Roger Taylor added that Lambert had \\"the best range I've ever heard\\" in a BBC interview in 2012. Pharrell Williams, after collaborating with Lambert on his Trespassing album, commented, \\"This kid has a voice like a siren - there's no guys singing in that Steve Winwood-Peter Cetera range.\\"  In October 2012, British tabloid the Sunday Mirror reported that Lambert had insured his voice for 48 million.

Answer:","output":"\\"England\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a relevant and accurate answer to the question. Here is a step-by-step justification of why \\"england\\" is the best answer: Step 1: Understanding the question The question asks where William the Conqueror was looking to go when he crossed the English Channel. This requires knowledge of historical events and geography related to William the Conqueror's actions. Step 2: Evaluating each possible answer a) \\"england\\" - This answer is directly related to the historical context of William the Conqueror, who invaded England in 1066 after crossing the English Channel. b) \\"go boating\\" - This answer is not relevant to the historical context, as the primary goal of crossing the English Channel was the invasion, not leisure activities like boating. c) \\"northern hemisphere\\" - While technically in the northern hemisphere, this answer is too vague and does not provide specific information regarding William the Conqueror's destination. d) \\"watch tv\\" - This answer is anachronistic and not relevant to the historical context, as television did not exist in the 11th century. e) \\"atlantic ocean\\" - The Atlantic Ocean is located west of England and not directly related to the English Channel crossing or the invasion target.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses.

Smell nice by keeping yourself and your clothes clean, but also consider adding a perfume or cologne to your fashion line-up. Avoid young scents like fruity smells in favor of something more mature for a really classy touch. Keep your clothes in a theme in order give yourself a signature style. This is a look that people will associate with you and will make you seem more stylish, even if they don’t necessarily like your clothes. The style you create for yourself should generally match who you are as a person. For example, a really sweet woman taking on a catty look will seem weird and out of place, the same as a serious businessman dressing in gangsta style. Tailor your clothes to fit your personality and people will be much more inclined to see it as your style. Do you ever feel like some models could wear a brown paper sack and still walk down a runway looking like the height of fashion? Do you know a guy who wears a tracksuit and still somehow manages to look totally fashionable? What the fashion industry doesn’t want you to know is that a lot of looking stylish really comes down to projecting confidence. You don’t have to actually be confident, of course, but if you walk down the street in clothes that you clearly think you look great in, people will usually be inclined to agree that (at a minimum) those clothes are perfect for you. The effortless part of the stylish look should of course be presented by giving off an air that you don’t care, or that you just threw on the first outfit you could find.  Be humble or indifferent when people compliment your clothes. In order to look stylish, you’re also going to want to look elegant and coordinated. This means not falling down if you’re wearing heels. Being graceful should be easier for guys, but is still important so don’t neglect it. Even if you’re wearing 4” stilettos, you need to look like it’s all perfectly natural and you’re perfectly comfortable. Don’t complain and constantly readjust your clothes. If that style isn’t working out for you, if you can’t seem casual in it, then try something that’s actually more comfortable. You can be comfortable and stylish. Again, effortless style is all about looking awesome while also looking like you didn’t try at all. Effortless, right? So relax. Take a generally chill attitude to everything in life. Always stay calm and happy, and you’ll look much better, no matter what you’re wearing. Summary:","output":"Scent and personal style contribute significantly to how people perceive you. To create a positive perception, maintain cleanliness, choose mature scents, and develop a signature clothing style that reflects your personality. Projecting confidence in your appearance, even if you're not confident, makes others perceive your clothing as stylish. Aim for an effortless look and don't fuss over your clothes, prioritizing comfort while maintaining elegance and coordination.

Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.

Each step is justified to ensure a proper and secure half ponytail. 1. Comb/Brush your hair - Begin by combing or brushing your hair to remove any tangles. This ensures a smooth foundation for your half ponytail. 2. Section the hair - Select the top half portion of your hair by running your thumbs from the top of your ears towards the back of your head. Having a clear section ensures a neat and structured half ponytail. 3. Secure the ponytail - Gather the hair from the top half section, and hold it firmly with one hand. Use the other hand to grasp a hair tie. Make sure the hair tie is sturdy and clean, as this will secure the half ponytail in place. Loop the hair tie around the base of the half ponytail until it feels snug but not too tight. A secure ponytail is essential for maintaining the style throughout the day. 4. Adjust the position - Check the position of the half ponytail and adjust it accordingly. You can place it higher or lower on the back of your head depending on your preference. Experiment with different positions to find the one that flatters your face shape and matches your desired style. 5. Smooth the hair - Use a comb or brush to smooth the hair around the half ponytail, as well as the hair in the ponytail itself. This step ensures a polished appearance and helps prevent any loose strands. 6. Optional: secure with bobby pins - If you have shorter layers or flyaways, use bobby pins to secure them in place. This will prevent any stray hairs from detracting from the overall look of your half ponytail. 7. Optional: customize your style - Add accessories, such as a bow or decorative hairpin, to personalize your half ponytail. These small details can transform the style and make it your own.

Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life.  The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\".  A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography.  The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima.  Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him.  Gadsden had been attending the demonstration as an observer.  He was related to the editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, The Birmingham World, who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for \\"parading without a permit\\", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, \\"Why didn't you bring a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one.\\"  Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position above the fold on the front page of The New York Times on May 4, 1963.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Robert Montgomery Knight (born October 25, 1940) is a retired American basketball coach. Nicknamed \\"The General\\", Knight won 902 NCAA Division I men's college basketball games, the most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently third all-time, behind his former player and assistant coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, and Jim Boeheim of Syracuse University. Knight is best known as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000. On March 14, 2000 (just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament), the CNN Sports Illustrated network ran a piece on Knight in which former player Neil Reed claimed he had been choked by Knight during a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, the network aired a tape of an Indiana practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Reed.  In response, Indiana University president Myles Brand announced that he had adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight\\" instead of simply \\"Knight.\\" Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in effigy.  Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic. On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team. Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of Sports Illustrated and around the clock coverage on ESPN.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did this do for him","output":"Robert Montgomery Knight, also known as \\"The General,\\" is a famous retired basketball coach. He coached a college basketball team called the Indiana Hoosiers for many years and was really good at it. One time, a player named Neil Reed said that Coach Knight choked him, but Coach Knight didn't agree. Later, a video showed Coach Knight touching Neil Reed's neck. Because of this, the president of Indiana University, Myles Brand, said Coach Knight had to behave very well from then on. In 2000, a student named Kent Harvey said \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Coach Knight, but Coach Knight thought that was disrespectful. He wanted to be called \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight.\\" This led to Myles Brand asking Coach Knight to leave his job, and when he didn't, Coach Knight was fired. Many students were upset and showed their support for Coach Knight. He later asked his supporters not to be mad at Kent Harvey and to keep supporting the basketball team.

The Ozarks in Missouri, and the  more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more.  Which rocks are less soluble, the ones from the Ozarks, or the ones from the Rockies?  Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the rocks in the Ozarks are more soluble than the ones in the Colorado Rockies. This is because the Ozark region is known for its abundant limestone formations and the presence of cave systems and blue holes, which are a result of the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that dissolves relatively easily in water and weak acids, leading to the formation of karst landscapes characterized by caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems. About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones, and since the Ozarks feature extensive cave systems and blue holes, it is safe to assume that a significant portion of their geological makeup consists of limestone. In contrast, the Colorado Rockies are a younger and more massive mountain range, primarily composed of granite, gneiss, and other igneous and metamorphic rocks. These types of rocks are more resistant to erosion and are less soluble than limestone found in the Ozarks. In summary, the rocks in the Ozarks, which are largely composed of limestone, are more soluble than those found in the Colorado Rockies, which consist predominantly of tougher igneous and metamorphic rocks. This difference in solubility contributes to the unique geologic features, such as caves and blue holes, that Peter enjoyed in the Ozarks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

OPT: - The government officials; - the people;","output":"In the sentence \\"The government officials publicly apologized to the people because they demanded an apology,\\" the pronoun \\"they\\" is most likely referring to \\"the people.\\" The sentence expresses that the government officials made a public apology, and the reason for this apology is because someone demanded it. From the given context, \\"the people\\" are the only other group mentioned who could have made this demand. Therefore, we can safely deduce that the pronoun \\"they\\" must be referring to \\"the people\\" in this instance. Considering both options: 1. The government officials: If \\"they\\" referred to the government officials, the sentence would imply that the government officials demanded an apology from themselves, which is less likely and might not make much sense contextually. 2. The people: The sentence appears to convey that the government officials owe the people an apology due to some transgression or mistake, and the people are demanding that the officials acknowledge and apologize for the situation. This interpretation is more logical and probable within the given context. So, after examining both possibilities, it seems reasonable to conclude that \\"they\\" is referring to \\"the people\\" in the sentence. This interpretation is supported by the context and implies a more coherent and likely explanation - that the people demanded an apology, and the government officials acted accordingly by offering a public apology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In ancient times, its quarries yielded countless stones for the famous temples in Thebes and along the River Nile; up to 3,000 men were working here. Your journey to Gebel El Silsila will be an eye-opening experience as you explore this historically significant site in Egypt. This location is situated on both banks of the River Nile, approximately 65 kilometers north of Aswan and was once known as \\"The Land of Gold\\" for its wealth in resources and materials. As an integral part of ancient Egyptian history, Gebel El Silsila was home to several quarries that provided vital stone materials used for constructing majestic temples, statues, and monuments in Thebes and other cities along the Nile. The quarries in Gebel El Silsila produced stones of various types, including sandstone and limestone, which were essential for the creation of some of ancient Egypt's most recognizable structures. Among these were the Luxor Temple, Karnak Temple, and the many colossal statues that shaped the landscape of the region. During its peak, these quarries put nearly 3,000 men to work, handling everything from extracting the materials to loading them onto boats for transport along the Nile River. These laborers formed an intricate web of skilled craftsmen, including stonecutters, carvers, masons, and engineers. Their knowledge and abilities enabled them to create some of the most enduring landmarks in history. Not only was Gebel El Silsila a crucial supplier of resources to the ancient Egyptians, but the site also holds immense religious significance. Many temples were built within the area itself, serving as places of worship and spiritual retreat for the thousands of workers employed in the quarries. Along the cliffs and within the quarries, you will find numerous rock-cut shrines and stelae dedicated to various deities and ruling pharaohs, providing valuable insights into the religious practices and beliefs of the time. Among the most impressive sights in Gebel El Silsila are the Speos of Horemheb, a rock-cut temple built by the pharaoh Horemheb during the New Kingdom (18th Dynasty), and the Chapel of Seti I, which features well-preserved inscriptions and relief carvings. Moreover, numerous inscriptions and graffiti left by the quarry workers paint a vivid picture of their daily lives and offer a unique perspective on the inner workings of ancient Egyptian society. As you sail to Gebel El Silsila, prepare to be captivated by the marvels of ancient architecture, engineering, and craftsmanship displayed throughout these historic quarries. As you explore the temples, shrines, and stelae hidden within the landscape, you will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the efforts and ingenuity that contributed to the prosperity and grandeur of ancient Egypt."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem: Solve -42*l = -38*l + 115*l - 1904 for l. And the answer is...","output":"To solve the given equation -42*l = -38*l + 115*l - 1904 for l, we should combine like terms and isolate l on one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. First, combine the l terms on the right side of the equation:    -42*l = (-38*l + 115*l) - 1904    -42*l = 77*l - 1904, since (-38 + 115 = 77) 2. Next, we want to get all the l terms on one side of the equation. We can do that by adding 42*l to both sides:    -42*l + 42*l = 77*l - 1904 + 42*l     0 = 119*l - 1904, since (77 + 42 = 119) 3. Now, isolate l by adding 1904 to both sides of the equation:    1904 = 119*l 4. Lastly, to find the value of l, divide both sides by 119:    l = 1904 / 119    l ≈ 16, since (1904 / 119 ≈ 16) So, the answer is: l ≈ 16."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: This is the 2nd time we've made it through this place without having to shoot anything.  Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence. Indeed, both sentences essentially state the same thing but are expressed in different linguistic styles.  The first sentence is expressed in a dialectical manner, possibly reflecting a certain regional vernacular or a particular character's speech in a story. It uses a variety of non-standard English  expressions and phrasings, such as \\"siree,\\" \\"th'\\" for 'the,' \\"havin'\\" for 'having,' \\"a sight of\\" for 'a lot of,' and \\"gunpowder\\" as a likely colloquialism for ammo or bullets. On the other hand, the second sentence is expressed in formal, standard English. It translates the meaning of the first sentence into more universally recognized English. \\"This is the 2nd time we've made it through this place without having to shoot anything\\" communicates the same message as the first sentence—namely, that the speaker and possibly a group have managed to traverse a certain area twice without needing to resort to using their weaponry. So, overall, both sentences share the same message, but they express it in different styles of speech. The second sentence retains the core information from the first sentence and frames it in a linguistic style that would probably be more widely understood.

Given those answer options, answer the question: One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa’s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a...

What kind of a mother will inform her daughter that she is nothing but \\"garbage\\"? And what kind of mother will believe, as Chua tells readers, that \\"an A- is not always a good grade\\"? The only activities her children should be permitted to do are those in which they can eventually win a medal, which must be gold. What kind of a mother she is? Why, a mother who is raising her kids in the typical Chinese way, rather than the Western way. In her new book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Chua tells her adventures in Chinese parenting, and -- so _ as she may be -- she is also mesmerizing  . Chua's voice is that of a happy, knowledgeable serial killer -- think Hannibal Lecter -- who's explaining how he's going to cut his next victim, as though it's the most self-evidently normal behavior.

It is something that all human have, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our parents, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things called \\"genes\\"  in our body. In 1953, two scientists, Watson and Crick, found out that those small parts are really messages.

Direct effects: With less water being processed, there will be less evaporated water collected and less salt removed from the water during each iteration of the process. Indirect effects: The reduced availability of water might lead to adjustments in the process parameters, such as finding alternative water sources or investing in more advanced technologies to increase the evaporation efficiency and salt removal.

He is now bedridden with fears he may never walk or talk again. Now the fighter’s devastated wife Bakanay Abdusalamova plans to sue the state of New York and its athletic commission, alleging negligence and medical malpractice. She claimed in court papers filed yesterday that officials allowed her husband to be 'violently beaten, bludgeoned, punched and pummeled by his opponent without proper, timely or adequate recognition, termination and or/rescue.' Court action: The family of Russian heavyweight boxer Magomed Abdusalamov, 32 (pictured) who was beaten into a coma in a November 2 bout has filed a 100¿million lawsuit. Brutal: Magomed Abdusalamov (right) lost a bloody bout to Cuba's Mike Perez on November 2 and also broke his hand and nose.

The couple's three daughters, Patimat, Shakhrizat and Saygibat, are listed as claimants along with their mother. The Dagestan native suffered a broken. nose and hand in the first round and was visibly disfigured by the fifth. round. In the seventh round, two ringside doctors inspected Abdusalamov but. cleared him to continue. Although Perez nearly knocked then 'Russian Tyson' down in the final round, the referee and his own trainer let. him finish the 10-round fight. The court papers say Abdusalamov, who absorbed 312 punches, was advised by state officials to go to a hospital when he urinated blood after the fight, but an ambulance was not provided. The severely injured boxer and his frightened family were forced to find a cab outside the entertainment venue during rush hour, the court papers say. 'They should have stopped the fight,' the fighter's cousin, Amin Suleymanov, told The New York Post. 'Everybody could see that.'

Summarize this article: As long as you keep up with your payment plan as spelled out in your promissory note, you are on track to successfully repaying your loan. Even if you are able to meet the payments without difficulties, you and the lender might prefer to put a buffer up so that you are not the ones handling the payments directly.  Consider hiring a loan manager to deal with the payments and send any reminder notices, annual reports, and other documents. Having an outside person dealing with the everyday administration of the loan can help you have a more normal relationship with the borrower. A major factor in a successful private loan is your ability to maintain clear communication and honest transparency with the lender. The lender should make herself available to talk, and hear you out if you have run into temporary financial difficulty. The borrower has a responsibility to be direct and honest with the lender from the start and throughout.  If you are anticipating having problems making a payment, speak to the lender as soon as possible and be prepared to offer a sensible alternative. You might like to set up regular meetings or conversations so you can both keep track of the loan. This gives you a formal forum to discuss any issues and work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. If you run into financial difficulty, and are struggling to make the payments, you should be prepared to work hard to make accommodations which ensure the borrower gets repaid. Treat the loan as you would a loan from a bank, and work with the lender to come up with an alternative payment schedule.  This could mean increasing the duration of the loan from ten to fifteen years, or altering the repayment schedule so a greater proportion of the loan is paid off in later years. Remember that you have to make an offer that benefits the lender as well. If you’re asking for a significant extension to the duration of the loan, be prepared to marginally increase the rate of interest. A big part of treating the loan as a professional agreement is keeping it isolated from your day-to-day interactions. Try to avoid talking about the loan at family occasions or when socialising. Keep it something you discuss at specific times, and try to contain it. This will be a lot easier if all the agreements are clear, and everybody is sticking to them. Summary:","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear and transparent line of communication between the lender and the borrower throughout the term of a loan. It suggests that hiring a loan manager could ease the process of payment, reminders, and reports, while preserving the relationship between the two parties. The article also recommends being proactive in case of anticipated financial issues that could affect the payments. Regular meetings could be set up to review the loan progress and negotiate mutually beneficial solutions for repayment. In case of financial difficulties, borrowers are encouraged to consider possible alterations to the repayment schedule while ensuring that it remains fair to the lender. Avoiding discussion of the loan outside of specific settings can help isolate it from day-to-day interactions. Furthermore, all arrangements should be clear to everyone involved to ensure smooth loan management."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Wills Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 04:56 EST, 4 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:52 EST, 4 November 2013. For fifty years, farmer Doug Goulbourne lived without running water. From the age of 21, he was forced to take a bucket back and forth to a tatttered water pump at Widow Croft Farm in Hollingworth, Greater Manchester, just so he could have a bath or pour himself a glass of water. But now, the 72-year-old has been connected to a water mains for the very first time, and celebrated by turning the tap, filling his kettle and making a cup of tea. Into the 21st century: Doug Goulbourne, 72, can now make himself a glass of water without having to walk to a water pump after almost 50 years without running water. Daily routine: He would have to take a bucket to the tattered pump if he ever wanted water. The farmer has been going back and forth to a tattered water pump in a ditch 50 yards away since his parents moved to the property in 1962. Now, after having to rescue unlucky frogs from the 166-year-old contraption at the break of dawn he  can enjoy quality H20 around the clock. 'I'm delighted,' said Mr Goulbourne,. who kept his bath full with water while the workmen from United Utilities dug around his. 84-acre farm just in case the supply ran out. 'Having. running water makes my life so much easier now. It's fantastic just. knowing when I turn on the tap - water is going to come out. Work: Mr Goulbounre, pictured working in the dairy,  moved to the farm in 1962 when he was 21-years-old. Property: The pump used on the farm in Hollingworth, Greater Manchester, was installed 166 years ago. Tough: The farmer has suffered many winters without any water at all, but can now enjoy H20 around the clock. 'It's a real pain having to thaw out your water supply every winter or worry about it drying up in the summer. I think it's marvellous now I have a mains supply and they say it is better water too.' Bachelor Mr Goulbourne inherited. Widows Croft Farm, built in 1837, from his father in the late 1960s. but he was happy to carry on using the well - which involved taking. water from a tank filled by gravity from water streams. He would wake up at 5.30am each day and get the water after he tended to his animals, including a pet cow called Susan, 60 cattle and four dogs. But. times were difficult when his rickety water pump, which channels water. from moorland streams, failed and he was left with no other. option but to fix it time and time again. Finally: He is now able to make a cup of tea by simply turning the tap and filling his kettle. Early rise: He would get the water after waking up at 5.30am each day to tend to his animals, which includes a cow called Susan, 60 cattle and four dogs. Despite the monotonous routine, he never thought about getting running water installed until the offer arrived. Under a new Â£3m scheme, United. Utilities have extended their water network to more remote parts of the. valley where the farmer lives, so supplies will be piped to him and more than. 30 other properties in the area. 'Having a well and no running water was like having a wooden leg,' said Mr Goulburne, who has not owned a working television for 14 years and builds. radios to communicate via Morse code with enthusiasts as far afield as. Spain and Croatia. Handed down: Bachelor Mr Goulbourne inherited Widows Croft Farm from his father in the late 1960s. 'If you've got one, you make do with it and carry on. The tank could pack up at any time and there would be no water to draw and I just to go without. 'It used to always seem to pack up on. Christmas Eve or Christmas morning. But when you're used to using. something you just carry on, it doesn't occur to you to change.' 'Now. it's going to make a tremendous difference. Some days I don't have the. energy I used to have. It's going to give me so much more time - I'll. feel ten years younger. 'It's. going to be lovely to have clean, clear water because there was a lot. of pollution in the other one. In spring I would get little frogs stuck. in the pump and I would have to pull them out. Now. the best thing is the water is just there. I don't have any problems. now. Now if I do have a problem I just ring the company up and they sort. it out. 'Some people. say, 'how can you live like that?' and I say 'well how do you think. people looked after themselves 1,000 years ago?' That's where people got. water from.' Content: Despite the monotonous routine, the farmer did not think about being connected to a water supply until he was offered one. He added: 'We are so lucky in this country having beautiful clean water. We should appreciate it more. But I'm tremendously grateful for what's happened. I have spent quite a lot of time this year messing about with the pump. 'Usually I have enough water to last through winter but this year I didn't have enough. It's run out through winter before and you just have to fix it.' Graham Dent, the United Utilities project co-ordinator said: 'It seems ironic that these properties are so close to our reservoir and yet they don't have mains water. 'We're going to put that right and there will be a lot of activity this autumn as we lay the new pipes. We've planned the work outside peak times and we are keeping the pipeline away from major highways as much as possible.' In 2010, only 30,021 out of more than 21 million households in England and Wales were not connected to the mains supply. Water began being pumped to British houses in the middle of the 19th century after people had previously relied on rivers and wells for their water.

When they say the name of a certain toy, Rico can find it. In fact, he seems to know the names of 200 toys! Some researchers in Germany wanted to test Rico. They put his toys in a room and then told him to go in the room and find a certain toy. Since nobody was in the room with Rico, he had no help from anyone finding the right toy. The researchers did this test forty times. Rico found the right toy thirty-seven times! Then the researchers tried something else. They put seven of Rico's toys in the room together with one new toy that Rico had never seen before. Then they told Rico to go into the room and get the new toy. This new toy had a name Rico had never heard before. Rico found the right toy seven out of ten times! Researchers cannot really say that Rico knows words or language. However, these tests seem to show that Rico can think about what he hears and think about what he knows. In fact, Rico seems to think and remember things as well as a three-year-old child.

By Mark Wilson For The Daily Mail For Ally McCoist, a brief period when football dominated the agenda at Rangers came to an abrupt halt on Friday. Two hours before the Ibrox manager conducted a 9am press briefing at Murray Park, a statement to the Stock Exchange spelled out the precarious financial position at the club. The launch of a new share issue is intended to raise £4million to provide a stop-gap injection of funds. An uptake of at least £3m is required for it to go ahead. Concern: Ally McCoist is worried about the club's perilous finances and the prospect of administration Having bubbled away in the background while the fluctuating form of McCoist’s team drew attention, monetary worries are once again front and centre at","output":"Ibrox. The urgency of the situation is evident, with the club on the precipice of financial disaster. The £4 million share issue initiative represents a last-ditch effort to create a temporary financial reprieve for the beleaguered institution. Club insiders and fans alike have voiced their increasing anxiety about the administration's handling of the finances, and the seemingly endless cycle of mismanagement that has plagued Rangers for years. As the prospect of administration looms over the heads of players, staff, and fans, there is an undeniable fear that the very identity and future of the club are at stake. The heavy burden of responsibility weighs not only on McCoist, who has managed the team through thick and thin, but also on the board members and executives who have allowed the situation to escalate to its current state. McCoist's concerns are shared by players and personnel at the club, with many feeling that the proposed share issue is merely a band-aid solution that won't address the deeper, long-term structural issues facing the organization. Amidst concerns about the club's ability to attract new investors, the £3 million minimum uptake required for the share issue to proceed seems like a tall order. In the event that the fundraising effort falls short, it's almost certain that Rangers will be forced into administration once again, with all the negative repercussions that such a scenario would entail. The club's precarious financial situation is undoubtedly affecting its sporting performance, as McCoist's team struggles to maintain consistency on the field. The persistent air of uncertainty, combined with the incessant waves of bad financial news, can't be conducive to a focused and stable team environment. Despite the various challenges that the squad is facing, McCoist continues to prioritize football and to work tirelessly to ensure his team's performance remains competitive. However, the 9am press briefing and the unforeseen announcement of the club's dire financial status serve as grim reminders that, ultimately, a strong financial foundation is crucial for the long-term health of the organization. As the Ibrox outfit awaits the outcome of the share issue, myriad questions remain unanswered. How has the club reached a position where a mere £4 million injection of funds is seen as a lifeline? Are the current executives and board members capable of leading the club out of this quagmire? And, most importantly, will the supporters – the lifeblood of the entire enterprise – continue to back a club that has dashed their hopes and dreams time and again? For now, all eyes are on the share issue's success or failure. The results will determine whether Rangers will be given a stay of execution or plunged, once more, into the abyss of administration. Both McCoist and the fans are holding their breath, hoping against hope that the club they love can somehow find a way to turn a corner and begin the long, arduous journey back to stability and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Before I left, I read an interesting story in a magazine. It read, \\"Once, while I was riding on a crowded bus, the man sitting next to me threw his cell phone out of the window when his phone rang. I was surprised. He looked at me, shrugged   and looked away. I had no idea whether it was his or stolen or whether he even knew what a cell phone was or not, but he clearly wanted to be free of it, because it clearly troubled him. \\" Billions of people across the world use cell phones.

Is Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. a good answer to this question? Pick from:  * yes;  * no;","output":"Yes, the statement made by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their book, The Grand Design, is a good answer to the question of whether questions of God's existence are similar to questions in natural science. They suggest that it is reasonable to inquire about the creation of the universe. However, if the answer given is God, the question then becomes who or what created God, leading to a similar line of inquiry as in natural science. The comparison to natural science is significant, as it highlights the importance of seeking evidence-based, testable explanations for the phenomena we observe. The scientific method demands that hypotheses should be based on empirical evidence, and it seeks to develop explanations that are consistent with observations, repeatable through experimentation, and falsifiable if new data contradicts the existing hypothesis. In the case of questions involving God, many might argue that these inquiries differ from those in natural science because they involve matters of faith, rather than evidence-based investigation. However, the perspective provided by Hawking and Mlodinow suggests that the questions share similarities with natural science in that they both address matters of causality, origin, and the nature of existence. The authors' approach to the question of God's existence also highlights the potential for an infinite regression of explanatory causes. If God created the universe, who or what created God? And who or what created that creator, and so on, ad infinitum? This idea is not confined to religious debate, as similar questions have arisen in the context of cosmology, which examines the origins and development of the universe. For instance, the Big Bang Theory posits that the universe began with an explosive expansion from an extremely condensed and hot state, approximately 13.8 billion years ago. However, when considering what led to the Big Bang, we may ask what caused the conditions necessary for that event to take place, initiating yet another line of inquiry into what preceded it. In conclusion, the statement by Hawking and Mlodinow is a good answer to the question at hand, as it illustrates the similarities between questions about God's existence and those posed in natural science when considering matters of causality and origin. The authors emphasize that when examining any type of question relating to the creation or origin of existence, it is essential to approach them using evidence-based and testable methods, while always being prepared for further inquiry as new knowledge and understanding develops."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plugging the known values into the formula: d = 1/2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * (2 s)^2 d = 1/2 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 4 s^2 d = 0.5 * 9.81 m/s^2 * 4 s^2 Calculating the distance: d = 0.5 * 39.24 m d = 19.62 meters So, in 2 seconds, you would fall approximately 19.62 meters, assuming there is no air resistance and you are close to the Earth's surface where the acceleration due to gravity is nearly constant. Remember that this is a simplified model and actual results may vary depending on additional factors such as air resistance or altitude."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Where might someone live if they are only able to have a small dog?  Here are possible answers to this question: - dog show - manhattan apartment - tree - farm - neighbor's yard  I believe the correct choice is \\"manhattan apartment\\", here's why: A:","output":"If someone is only able to have a small dog, there could be various reasons behind this limitation, such as living in a confined space, having restrictions imposed by the landlord or the housing society, or simply a personal preference. Out of the options provided, the most suitable choice for someone in this situation would be a Manhattan apartment. Here's why: 1. Limited space: Manhattan apartments are known for their relatively smaller size, especially when compared to house properties. Most of these apartments don't have the luxury of a large backyard or a spacious lawn, which makes it challenging to accommodate a big dog that requires ample space to run and play. On the other hand, small dog breeds typically adapt well to smaller spaces and can live comfortably in an apartment setting. 2. Housing and lease restrictions: Many apartment buildings, particularly in urban areas like Manhattan, may enforce strict rules and regulations when it comes to pet ownership. A building may restrict the size, weight, or breed of dogs allowed as pets for residents. In such cases, having a small dog would be a more practical choice, as they are more likely to comply with these restrictions. 3. Living among neighbors: Apartments are usually part of a larger community, and in places like Manhattan where social interaction is a common occurrence, having pets that are easy to manage, less aggressive, and have a lower potential for causing disturbances, is certainly a better choice. Small dogs tend to fit this bill and are generally more accepted by neighbors than larger, more boisterous dogs. 4. Easier maintenance: With busy city lives and limited available time, having a small dog can also be easier to manage in terms of grooming, training, and daily care. In an apartment setting, taking care of a smaller pet is more convenient as they require less space for their living, sleeping, and feeding areas. 5. Access to city amenities: Manhattan is known for its vast array of amenities, including dog-friendly parks and pet services. Many of these spaces and services are designed with small dogs in mind, catering to the needs of urban dwellers and their pets. Living in a Manhattan apartment provides easy access to these resources, making it an ideal location for someone with a small dog. In conclusion, a Manhattan apartment appears to be the best option among the choices provided for someone who is only able to have a small dog. This living arrangement not only accommodates the practicalities of caring for a small dog but also provides the necessary resources for a pet owner in an urban setting to ensure a healthy and fulfilling life for their furry companion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: A Single Man Context: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room.

At a confiscation ruling in January the four ringleaders of the heist were ordered to pay back £27.5m or serve another seven years in jail.      Prosecutors said John \\"Kenny\\" Collins, Daniel Jones, Terry Perkins and Brian Reader - who were all in their 60s and 70s - benefited by an estimated £13.69m from the burglary.      Only £4.3m had been recovered.      Perkins died a week after the confiscation ruling at Woolwich Crown Court.

Disguised as workmen, the men entered through a lift shaft and used a heavy duty diamond-tipped drill to cut a hole through the vault wall which was big enough for two men to squeeze through.      The gang then raided 73 safety deposit boxes, stealing valuables including gold, diamonds and sapphires. ||||| This article is over 9 months old      Detectives are hunting mysterious figure known as ‘Basil’ for the £14m burglary      Police hunting for a ringleader behind the £14m Hatton Garden heist nicknamed “Basil” have made an arrest.      Scotland Yard said a 57-year-old man was detained on Tuesday morning in London in connection with the 2015 burglary in which which elderly crooks broke into a secure vault and stolejewellery, cash, gold and platinum.            Announcing the arrest, police said a number of items were seized from the address raided in Islington, north London, when detectives executed a search warrant at 7.30am.      Flying Squad detectives have been searching for those who evaded capture after the burglary.      Their main target has been Basil, a mystery figure who has been at large for the past three years.      After members of the gang were convicted and jailed for the heist in 2016, police put out an appeal for information about Basil. There are no plans to reissue it, it is understood. Police think he played a crucial role in getting the gang into the building housing the vault that contained the safety deposit boxes.      The mystery man helped the gang but his identity has never become public. Those convicted of the burglary say they did not know his real name.            Police gave few details about the raid, but said the man was arrested “on suspicion of non-residential burglary”, and not for the lesser charge of handling stolen goods.      The heist over the Easter weekend in 2015 was the largest burglary in English criminal history and a large amount of the stolen valuables are still unaccounted for.      The men drilled through a 50cm-thick concrete wall and broke into 73 security boxes in London’s diamond district without leaving a forensic trace.      Among the ringleaders convicted after a 2016 trial were John Collins, 77, of Islington; Daniel Jones, 63, of Enfield, north London; Brian Reader, 78, of Dartford, Kent; and Terry Perkins, 69, from Enfield, who died in prison in February.            The break-in began on 2 April 2015 and CCTV showed Collins and others arriving in a white van at Hatton Garden at around 8.20pm.      Soon after, a red-haired man – the unidentified Basil, possibly wearing a wig – let them in through a fire exit on a nearby street, which had access to the building housing the vault at 88-90 Hatton Garden.      Basil opened the door of the building, having gained codes for doors and a key for a mortice lock on the front door.      Police believe Basil, whose face investigators were unable to get a clear image of from the CCTV footage, was brought in for technical expertise. He was most likely involved in several roles, including neutralising the alarm and handling the electrics. Once in, Basil opened a fire escape door to the building. ||||| The thieves ransacked 73 safe deposit boxes and stuffed the loot into plastic garbage cans before making their getaway. Officers later found the book “Forensics for Dummies” at one suspect’s home. They continued to use their cellphones after the burglary, helping detectives to trace them.      Prosecutors said that the ringleaders — Daniel Jones, 61; Terrence Perkins, 67; John Collins, 75; and Brian Reader; 77 — had received an estimated £13.7 million from the burglary, but only £4.3 million has been recovered.

In a confiscation hearing this year, prosecutors said that the gang members must pay back more than £6 million each based on their “available assets” or face an additional seven years in jail.      “A number of these defendants are not only of a certain age, but have in some cases serious health problems,” Judge Christopher Kinch said during the hearing. “But as a matter of principle and policy, it is very difficult to endorse any approach that there is particular treatment for someone who chooses to go out and commit offenses at the advanced stage of their lives that some of these defendants were.”      Mr. Perkins, who had diabetes and health problems, died in his cell in Belmarsh prison in February, a week after he was ordered to pay compensation.      It is unclear if the arrest on Tuesday cleared up the one remaining mystery in the case: the identity of another burglar, known as Basil, who was filmed by security cameras during the theft but who had not been caught. The police suspect that he opened a door to a fire escape to allow the rest of the gang to enter, and that he sought to disable the alarm protecting the safe deposit boxes.      Mr. Jones had written a letter to Sky News saying that Basil was a former police officer who was involved in private security. But prosecutors have said that Mr. Jones misled the authorities in the past. The police had offered a reward of £20,000 for information leading to Basil’s arrest. ||||| Share this article with Google Plus      The huge holes bored through a half-meter thick concrete wall drilled to access a vault in a safe deposit centre in Hatton Garden, London (Picture: Getty)      A fresh arrest has been made by detectives investigating the Hatton Garden heist.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? pick from the following.  + mid-ocean ridges;  + desert sand dunes;  + U-shaped valleys;  + continental shelves;","output":"The correct answer to the question, \\"Which of these features of Earth's crust are caused by the shifting of tectonic plates?\\" is: + mid-ocean ridges A brief on each of the given choices helps us determine the correct answer by understanding how they are formed and their relation to tectonic plates: 1. Mid-Ocean Ridges: Mid-ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges, formed by the interaction of tectonic plates. These geological features are the result of the process known as seafloor spreading, where new oceanic crust is created by the upwelling of magma at the boundary of two diverging tectonic plates. As molten material emerges from the mantle and solidifies, it pushes the older crust on either side of the ridge apart, causing the plates to move apart. This continuous process can cause earthquakes and the formation of volcanoes along the ridge. Some examples of mid-ocean ridges include the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the East Pacific Rise, and the Indian Ocean Ridge. 2. Desert Sand Dunes: Desert sand dunes are wind-blown sand formations that develop over time in arid environments. While tectonic plate movement can have an indirect influence on the formation of deserts by altering global weather patterns and the location of landmasses, it is not the primary cause of sand dunes themselves. Instead, sand dune formation is controlled by local wind and sediment supply conditions. Examples of desert sand dunes can be seen in the Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert, and the Great Basin Desert in North America. 3. U-Shaped Valleys: U-shaped valleys are large, glacier-carved valleys with a distinct U-shaped cross-sectional profile. The formation of U-shaped valleys is the result of a glacier eroding its way through a previously V-shaped river valley, typically during an ice age. As the glacier flows through the valley, it deepens and widens the landscape, creating the signature U-shape. While tectonic plate movements and the resulting changes in climate can influence the formation of glaciers, the actual shaping of U-shaped valleys is caused by the erosional forces of glaciers. Examples of U-shaped valleys can be found in the Alps, the Canadian Rockies, and the Himalayas. 4. Continental Shelves: Continental shelves are the submerged, relatively shallow parts of continents that slope gradually seaward. They extend from the coastline to the point where they slope sharply downward to the deep ocean floor, called the shelf break. Continental shelves are formed by the accumulation of sediments brought by rivers or through coastal erosion, as well as being a part of the continental crust. The formation of continental shelves is impacted by various factors, including sea level variation and the geological processes of the continental crust, but it is not directly caused by the shifting of tectonic plates. Notable continental shelves include the Siberian Shelf, Sunda Shelf, and the Grand Banks, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. In conclusion, among the given choices, mid-ocean ridges are the features of Earth's crust that are directly caused by the shifting of tectonic plates, making it the correct answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir...

Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"Try using shampoo daily until symptoms are under control; then start to wash two or three times a week. If one type of shampoo loses its effectiveness after a while, try alternating between two types of anti-dandruff shampoos. It is important to maintain a consistent hair care routine to effectively manage dandruff. Using an anti-dandruff shampoo specifically designed to target the cause of dandruff can help reduce the presence of flakes and scalp irritation. When first starting the treatment, it is recommended to wash your hair with the shampoo daily, as this helps to keep the dandruff under control and lessens the severity of symptoms. Once the dandruff has become more manageable, you can reduce the frequency of washing your hair with the anti-dandruff shampoo. Washing your hair two or three times a week should be sufficient to maintain control over dandruff. This will help prevent the overuse of shampoo, which can sometimes lead to dryness and further irritation of the scalp. However, it is not uncommon for a specific type of shampoo to lose its effectiveness over time. This can happen due to various reasons, such as your scalp becoming resistant to the active ingredients in the shampoo, or changes in your body's chemistry. When this occurs, it's essential to find an alternative solution. The best way to tackle this issue is to alternate between two different types of anti-dandruff shampoos. This can help maintain the effectiveness of the treatment, as your scalp is exposed to different active ingredients and thus does not become resistant to one specific type. It's important to select shampoos that target various causes of dandruff, such as those containing zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole, salicylic acid, or coal tar. By following these steps and establishing a consistent hair care routine, you should be able to successfully manage and control your dandruff symptoms. Keep in mind that individual responses to treatments may vary, so finding the right combination of shampoos and washing frequency that works best for you may take some experimentation. Consulting with a dermatologist or hair care professional can also provide additional guidance and recommendations tailored to your specific needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Sabina left after they left their family? from the following article ?  Tomas, a successful brain surgeon in Communist Czechoslovakia, is pursuing an affair with Sabina, an equally care-free artist in Prague. Dr Tomas takes a trip to a spa town for a specialized surgery. There, he meets dissatisfied waitress Tereza, who desires intellectual stimulation. She tracks him down in Prague and moves in with him, complicating Tomas's affairs. Tomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is fascinated and jealous as she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers, but feels affection for Sabina. Nevertheless, Tomas marries Tereza, in a simple ceremony with both perpetually laughing, followed by her double standard distress about Tomas' promiscuity. Although she considers leaving Tomas, she becomes more attached to Tomas when the Soviet Army invades Czechoslovakia. Amidst the confusion, Tereza photographs demonstrations against the Soviet forces, then hands the rolls of film to foreigners to smuggle to the West. Facing the stultifying reality that replaced the Prague Spring, Tomas, Sabina and Tereza flee Czechoslovakia for Switzerland: first Sabina, then the hesitant Tomas and Tereza. In Geneva, Sabina encounters Franz, a married university professor: they begin a love affair. After some time, he decides to abandon his wife and family for her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decide to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account, and it kick-started a peculiar British Film Genre- the Military Prison Camp story that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959). The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched. There are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn't give way for unlikely drama, jump cuts or jacked up (somethings about to happen!) music. It is utterly of its time and works beautifully. Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. They keep emotion out of their roles. As so many were, until recently, ex-service, I suspect they recreated their war time roles as 'Officers and Gentlemen'. This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most Wartime Escape Films, the story doesn't end at the barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end.","output":"The sentiment of this passage seems to be positive towards the movie \\"The Wooden Horse.\\" The writer mentions how the film is quiet and has a steady storyline, which builds up to a climax that creates tension.

Dick was enraged to see how contentedly the men bore the irksome confinement, the meager food, and harsh peremptoriness of the beardless boys set over them as guards.  Most of the prisoners passed the time in cards, playing for buttons, trinkets, or what not that formed their scanty possessions.  Dick learned that all the commissioned officers of the company with Wesley Boone had been wounded or killed in the charge near the stone bridge.  Wesley had been with the prisoners at first.  He had been struck on the head, and was in a raging fever when his father and sister came to the prison to take him away.  No one could tell where he was now, but Dick knew that he must be in the city, since there were no exchanges, the Confederates allowing no one to leave the lines except women with the dead, or those who came from the North on special permits.  Then he visited the provost headquarters, and was shown the complete list of names recorded in the books there; but Barney's was not among them.  At the Spottswood Hotel, the day after his coming, he met Elisha Boone, haggard, depressed, almost despairing.

Process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point.  Question: suppose winds are funneled toward the turbine happens, how will it affect higher temperature used.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"A: More To fully comprehend why the answer is \\"more,\\" we must analyze the entire process and understand how wind affects the system's temperature. When we consider the process of desalinating saltwater, it's essential to note that the procedure typically involves boiling the water at high temperatures. As the water evaporates, salt particles are separated from the water, leaving behind freshwater that can be consumed. Various methods are used to achieve this, including high-temperature process heating (such as using steam) or methods that optimize the use of heat available from the system (like multi-stage flash distillation). In the context of the question, if winds are funneled toward the turbine, it implies that there is an increase in airflow over the desalination system. The wind, much like a cooling fan in a heat-generating device, will have a cooling effect on the system. Greater airflow will lead to improved heat exchange, dissipating excessive heat from the system and increasing its efficiency. As a result, the desalination process might have to counter the cooling effect of the wind by maintaining higher temperatures to ensure optimal evaporation of water. Therefore, if the wind were funneled towards the turbine and the associated temperature dynamics in the desalination process, there would likely be a need for higher temperatures to compensate for the increased cooling effect brought about by the wind. This is why the answer is \\"more.\\" It is necessary to highlight that multiple factors influence the desalination process, and this answer assumes that the cooling effect of the wind is sufficiently significant to raise the required temperature. Depending on the specific setup and efficiency of the desalination system and the local environment, there is a possibility that the effect of wind on the temperature requirement might be lower under some circumstances. Nonetheless, the general trend would suggest that increased wind will lead to a need for higher temperatures in the desalination process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What will likely happen next ?","output":"Given the context, several possibilities could occur next in the story. To use some tracking skills they learned on safari implying they have a sense of adventure and problem-solving abilities, they would possibly try to deduce their parents' location. They might first search for clues at the house. They might check whether a note was left, observe to see if any specific clothing was missing suggesting their parents went to a specific event, or if any dishes are left in the sink which could hint that parents will come back soon. Perhaps they would try to notice any new items that weren't there before like tickets to events, a brochure for a local restaurant, or a receipt from a nearby shop. Interpreting these clues can guide them on their next step. If for instance, they found event tickets, they may head to that location hoping to surprise their parents there. If they saw a receipt from a local shop or restaurant, it might imply their parent's recent activities, and they could go to these places to ask if anyone has seen them. In order to gather more information, they could also talk to the neighbors. Neighbors could be aware of their parent's plans, especially if they are on good terms.  Another approach might be to visit their parents' common hangout spots. This could be a local pub, park, or community center. Their parents might have a predictable routine, so they could try to interrupt that.  Also, it is worth mentioning that even though the couple has decided to be sneaky, they might change their mind and call their parents directly or any mutual acquaintance who might be aware of the parent's plan, as it would be quite impractical if their parents were out for a longer period or out of the city.  If, on the other hand, their parents are out of town, the couple could decide to enjoy themselves and have a little holiday of their own. This would present a delightful twist, making their surprise visit an unexpected adventure.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the last names of the four people that led the march and formed a breakaway group?  Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released  the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival.

Q: where is the shema found in the torah? A:","output":"The Shema is found in the Torah, specifically within the book of Deuteronomy, often referred to as Devarim in Hebrew. The Shema is considered one of the most essential prayers in Judaism and serves as a declaration of faith and absolute monotheism. The verse in question appears in Deuteronomy 6:4, which states: \\"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\\" In Hebrew, this verse is written as \\"שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָֽד\\". The term \\"Shema\\" itself derives from the Hebrew word \\"שְׁמַע\\", which translates to \\"hear\\" or \\"listen.\\" The Shema appears in a wider context within a passage known as the Shema Yisrael, encompassing Deuteronomy 6:4-9, shaping the basic tenets of Jewish belief and tradition. This passage outlines the importance of wholeheartedly loving God, obeying His commandments, and passing these teachings on to future generations. Additionally, it emphasizes the significance of the first commandment: acknowledging the existence of only one God, who is forever indivisible and incorporeal. The Shema prayer also consists of three additional biblical passages: Deuteronomy 11:13-21, Numbers 15:37-41, and Deuteronomy 6:10-12. These passages reiterate devotion to God, the need to follow His commandments, and serve as a reminder of the miraculous exodus from Egyptian slavery. Collectively, these four passages come together to form the central prayer of Judaism. The Shema prayer is recited twice daily, during morning (Shacharit) and evening (Ma'ariv) services in accordance with God's command to \\"speak of them when you sit at home and when you cross the road when you lie down and when you rise\\" (Deuteronomy 6:7). In addition to daily scriptural readings, the Shema is also included as part of the bedtime prayer (Kriat Shema al haMitah) and is spoken by Jews on their deathbed as a final affirmation of faith. The Shema holds great importance in Jewish life and practice since it serves as a public declaration of faith, a reminder of the relationship between God and the Jewish people, and a focal point for daily prayer. It holds a central position within Jewish worship both privately and publicly, reflecting the fundamental belief in a single, omnipotent, and ever-present God."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry was cooking so much in the third quarter of Game 3 that after a successful driving floater in traffic, he faced the crowd, took his mouthpiece out and shouted, \\"This is my f---ing house!\\"      \\"I blacked out,\\" he said.      Curry's emotions erupted in step with his offensive output as he scored 18 of his game-high 35 points in a pivotal third quarter in which the Golden State Warriors broke the game open, resulting in a 126-85 thumping of the Houston Rockets to take a 2-1 series lead in the Western Conference finals.      His mother, Sonya Curry, was pleased with her son's performance, but not with his mouth.      \\"She already sent me two home videos, showing me the clip and playing it back,\\" Curry told ESPN. \\"She was telling me how I need to wash my mouth out, saying to wash it out with soap. It's a message I've heard before.\\"      It was Curry's breakout game in this series, but he is a devout Christian and says he understands why he received such a scolding.      \\"She's right,\\" Curry told ESPN. \\"I gotta do better. I can't talk like that.\\"      He cooled off his tongue thereafter, but he channeled his emotions elsewhere.      In the same quarter, Curry received the ball from Kevin Durant well beyond the 3-point line and launched a 30-footer over the outstretched arms of Chris Paul that tickled nothing but the net.      About a minute later, Curry used a screen to get James Harden to switch onto him and he crossed him over and nailed a step-back contested triple. And while backpedaling to get set on defense, the two-time MVP stopped and performed a shimmy dance to the fans' delight.      \\"You know, I've seen those explosions happen here and everywhere,\\" said Draymond Green, who provided 10 points, a game-high 17 boards and six assists. \\"It's not just here. Nonetheless, definitely get a lot of support from the fans. His 3 is similar to some people's dunk. You go to certain arenas and a guy gets a dunk and it's just absurd. That's how his 3-ball is.

I don't mean to disappoint, but I've seen crazier from him, but it was good to see.\\"      Curry thrived despite a Rockets game plan that continued to target him on the defensive end, a strategy that had seemed to work in tiring him out in Games 1 and 2.      Curry was the primary defender on 15 plays in Game 3, tied for the second most by a Warriors player with Kevon Looney behind Green's 17.      In Game 2, the Rockets targeted Curry on 23 possessions, the most he has been targeted in a game this postseason. He was the primary defender on 20 plays in Game 1.      With Curry getting picked on defensively for the series' first two games, it was Harden's turn Sunday.      The Warriors were 7-of-11 from the field with Harden as the primary defender, and it included a combined 6-of-7 by Curry and Durant, who supplied 25 points. Golden State shot 8-of-14 (6-of-10 contested) against Harden. Of the eight field goals that the Warriors made against Harden, five were layups or dunks.      \\"Just being aggressive in those situations,\\" Curry said about attacking Harden. \\"Because I find myself in those type of isolation situations a lot with how they guard, so you can make plays and be ready for those type of one-on-one situations.\\"      Going into the contest, Curry was struggling with the long ball, with 2-of-13 shooting from beyond the arc. He started off the game 1-of-6 from 3, but ended the evening 13-of-23 from the field and 5-of-12 on 3-pointers.      He said the emotions he played with had nothing to do with how much his play has been criticized recently.      \\"A lot of it was just [me] talking to myself, almost like you've got to be your biggest fan sometimes,\\" he said. \\"No matter what questions I was being asked over the first two games or what the expectations was, I had the highest expectations for myself. And you've just got to -- find whatever you want to get going. I mean, obviously, it felt good, and you want to use that energy to show your teammates that you're here, you're with them, get the crowd into it. But it's one game, and you've got to have that same type of energy and intentions and focus the next game and the right approach. So, I did my job tonight. I've got to do it again.\\"      Curry, Durant and Klay Thompson (13) combined for 73 points. The Warriors are 4-0 this postseason when the trio combine for 70 or more. Curry extended his NBA-record streak of playoff games with a made 3-pointer to 82 games.      He appears to be back, but his coach says he never left.      \\"This guy's a two-time MVP, and he bounces back from bad games as well as anybody I've ever seen, so it didn't surprise me,\\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ||||| Steph Curry's mom: Wash your mouth out with soap      Even Steph Curry can be scolded by his mom once in a while.

It was in the heat of the moment and probably an emotional night for Curry, who's had his share of struggles since returning from injury.      The curse seen 'round the world was also on the mind of his teammate Klay Thompson, who said he hoped Curry's daughter Riley \\"didn't see it.\\"      But he also noted that it got the Warriors' arena \\"fired up.\\" So maybe a little soap in the mouth was worth it.

Context: Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers. The answer is:","output":"Napoleon built his force at Boulogne in Northern France."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to what time did the world trade center towers fall??","output":"The World Trade Center (WTC) towers in New York City were attacked on the morning of September 11, 2001. Two planes hijacked by terrorists associated with the terrorist group Al-Qaeda crashed into the Twin Towers, resulting in their collapse. The precise times of the collapse of each tower are as follows: 1. North Tower (WTC 1): The North Tower, also known as the World Trade Center 1 (WTC 1), was hit first when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the building at 8:46 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time). The plane struck the North Tower between the 93rd and 99th floors, causing massive structural damage and igniting a fire. The fire, combined with the damage, weakened the building's steel supports and ultimately led to its collapse at 10:28 a.m. Approximately 1 hour and 42 minutes elapsed between the initial impact of the plane and the collapse of the North Tower. 2. South Tower (WTC 2): The South Tower, or World Trade Center 2 (WTC 2), was hit shortly after the North Tower when United Airlines Flight 175 struck the building at 9:03 a.m. The plane collided with the South Tower between the 77th and 85th floors, causing a similar scenario of structural damage and intense fires as seen in the North Tower. However, the South Tower collapsed earlier than the North Tower, at 9:59 a.m., approximately 56 minutes after it was struck by the plane. It is important to remember that the collapse of the World Trade Center towers had devastating consequences, taking the lives of almost 3,000 people. The attack on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, also caused significant destruction and loss of life at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania, where a fourth hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed after passengers attempted to regain control from the terrorists on board. This tragic event led to far-reaching impacts on global politics, security policies, and international military engagements."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

AP - Paul Hamm is finally going to have an answer for everyone who asks if he's going to be able to keep his Olympic gold medal.","output":"This question is about Paul Hamm, an American artistic gymnast, who faced controversy regarding his Olympic gold medal in men's All-Around gymnastics competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Paul Hamm won the gold medal in a dramatic come-from-behind victory after a significant error in his vault performance. After overcoming the setback, he performed exceptionally well in the remaining events and edged out his opponents to claim the All-Around title. The controversy arose after it was discovered that there was a scoring error in the Parallel Bars routine of South Korean gymnast Yang Tae-Young, who won the bronze medal. The error was a result of the judges wrongly deducting 0.1 points from Yang's start value, which is a measure of the routine's difficulty. If the correct start value had been applied, Yang would have won the gold medal, with Hamm being awarded the silver. The South Korean Olympic committee filed a complaint with the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) requesting a review of the judging process. FIG admitted the scoring error and suspended the judges responsible. However, they did not change the results or request that Paul Hamm return his gold medal, as they believed that the South Korean delegation should have protested immediately following the competition. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) supported Hamm's right to keep the gold medal, arguing that many competitions do not change standings once they are finalized, even in the event of a judging mistake. They also contended that revisiting the final results could open the door for countless similar appeals in various sports and disrupt the integrity of the Olympic Games. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was eventually called in to make a final decision on the matter. On October 21, 2004, CAS denied South Korea's appeal to change the results. They ruled that Yang Tae-Young's final score couldn't be modified due to the time limit for appeals having expired, and there was not sufficient evidence to prove that the judges' error was an act of \\"bad faith or dishonesty.\\" After the CAS ruling, Paul Hamm was allowed to keep his Olympic gold medal, putting an end to the controversy. Despite the contentious circumstances surrounding his victory, Hamm's remarkable comeback performance remains an iconic moment in the history of Olympic gymnastics. The controversy also led to sweeping changes in the sport of gymnastics, with the FIG implementing a new scoring system to reduce subjectivity in judging and to ensure greater accuracy in evaluating routines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Military history of the United States In the Treaty of Paris after the Revolution, the British had ceded the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the United States, without consulting the Shawnee, Cherokee, Choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there. Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began dividing these lands for settlement. This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.

Lou was the smallest in stature of four boys in an athletic family; his brother Alex became a star basketball player at the University of Kentucky, a member of two national championship teams. After Groza retired, he entertained an offer to play for the San Francisco 49ers, but was reluctant to do so because he did not want to move his family and insurance business to the West Coast. He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach, helping mentor the young Don Cockroft, but he declined. Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments. He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea, Ohio near the Browns' headquarters and training facility. He and his wife Jackie were known as the team's First Family.  Modell relocated the Browns to Baltimore in 1995 and renamed the team the Ravens, provoking a wave of anger and disbelief from fans and former players.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.

The 28-year-old from Solihull, West Midlands, has admitted rape and 21 offences of causing or inciting sexual activity with children. He will be sentenced on Tuesday. Birmingham Crown Court heard he duped 18 victims in all, with the offences taking place between 2011 and 2016. He created fake Facebook personas of teenage girls and would use them to get boys to send him naked images. The boys would then be urged to engage in sex acts and, if they they refused, he would blackmail them by threatening to send their photos to their friends or family. Prosecutor Matthew Brook said Chapman's aims were to get the boys to send him naked pictures so he could blackmail them, and then to encourage them to meet up with a boy and, ultimately, to meet up with himself. One blackmail victim agreed to meet a boy, who turned out to be Chapman. Chapman, of Tamar Drive, raped him and filmed it on the boy's phone. Police traced Chapman through internet addresses he left behind when logging into his fake profiles. He is part-way through being sentenced and has also pleaded guilty to nine counts of taking, making and distributing indecent photos of children.

Between 2011 and 2016, Chapman duped 18 victims by creating fake Facebook personas of teenage girls, tricking teenage boys into sending him explicit images. He then blackmailed them, threatening to send their photos to friends or family if they did not engage in sex acts or meet up with him in person. One of the blackmail victims agreed to meet with a boy, who was actually Chapman, resulting in the rape that was filmed on the boy's phone. Chapman was traced by police through the internet addresses he used for his fake profiles.

Willi (Walter Slezak), a German survivor, is pulled aboard and denies being the U-boat's captain. During an animated debate, engine room crewman Kovac (John Hodiak) demands the German be thrown out to drown. However, the others object, with radioman Stanley (Hume Cronyn), wealthy industrialist Rittenhouse (Henry Hull) and columnist Connie Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), who speaks German, succeeding in arguing that he be allowed to stay. Porter, initially alone in the boat, had managed to bring her luggage with her, and her primary concern at first is a run in her stocking. She is thrilled at having filmed the battle between the two vessels, but her movie camera is the first in a series of her possessions to be lost overboard in a succession of incidents.

The Paralympic star was jailed for five years in 2014 for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp. Ms Steenkamp's parents have said that the time he has served is \\"not enough for taking a life\\". A state appeal against his acquittal on murder charges is due in November. Under South African law, Pistorius is eligible for release under \\"correctional supervision\\" having served a sixth of his sentence. South African Commissioner of Correctional Services Zach Modise told the BBC that the case management committee at the Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria, where Pistorius is being held, made the recommendation last week. The decision is likely to mean a spell under house arrest for Pistorius. The double amputee shot and killed Ms Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door at his Pretoria home, believing she was an intruder, he told his trial. In March a Johannesburg court blocked his legal team's attempts to stop the prosecutors' appeal. State prosecutors say Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder - if convicted he could face a much more lengthy jail term. Tania Koen, a lawyer for Ms Steenkamp's parents Barry and June, said that while the two had forgiven Pistorius, \\"ten months is not enough\\". \\"It also doesn't send out the proper message and serve as the proper deterrent as the way it should.\\" The decision will reignite a national debate in South Africa about the rule of law, says the BBC's Milton Nkosi. Pistorius was born without the fibulas in both of his legs, and had surgery to amputate both below the knee while still a baby.

Article: When travelers think of an Adriatic cruise, scenes of Venice, Italy--its canals, bridges, piazzas, and stunning architecture--come to mind. It's one of the most popular cruise destinations in Europe. And for many, the sail-away from Venice, through its Giudecca Canal, is an awe-inspiring experience. Venice may be known as La Serenissima, or \\"the most peaceful,\\" which, however, isn't entirely accurate these days. Venetians have been increasingly concerned about the impact of tourism and the potential for an environmental disaster off its shoreline due to the number of cruise ships that enter and exit its lagoon . That's why earlier last month, Venice announced a new policy to forbid the transit  of cruise ships to the city via the Giudecca Canal. It's not that the city wants to shun the cruise industry altogether: It simply wants to force traffic further away from the landmarks along the shoreline. City officials say that most ships will now transit the Contorta Sant'Angelo Canal. Additionally, the city is _ the size of ships that can visit Venice, as well as the total number of ships that call on it on a daily basis. As of January 2014, Venice plans to reduce the visitations of larger ships (those that are 40,000 tons or heavier) by 20 percent. This effectively caps the number of ships that can enter per day to five. In November, ships heavier than 96,000 tons will not be allowed to enter Guidecca Canal at all. How the city plans to carry out the new five-ships-per-day rule remains to be seen and have yet to be announced. Which ships will be allowed passage? Will it be first-come, first-served? However they proceed, cruise line executives want their passengers to know that Venice will remain a regular port of call--even if the transit to and from the city must evolve.

Q:This article: Just-married taxi driver Thomas Leslie 'Tom' Manning is led to an abandoned bomb-site by an eight-year-old girl who says that she has lost her dog. The kind-hearted Manning gives her his handkerchief to dry her tears. She then runs off taunting Manning as an April-fool prank. He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz.

The trial begins at London's Old Bailey, where Tanner is opposed by his father, prosecuting counsel Geoffrey Tanner. The trial is presided over by Justice Harrington, whose wife is in the hospital undergoing a serious operation. It soon becomes evident that things are going badly for Manning. Jurors are seen expressing their belief in Manning's guilt even before the trial was over.

Summarize the following: A rocks glass is a small glass tumbler that holds between 6 to 10  fl oz (180 to 300 mL). These are often decorative and you can purchase them alone or as part of a whiskey decanter set. Drinking your Jameson from a rocks glass will promote a smooth drinking experience. Keep in mind that you can drink whiskey out of any glass you want. For example, you could pour it into a ceramic coffee mug, a tin cup, or even a disposable plastic cup if that’s what you want to use. If you want to experience the full spectrum of flavors in the whiskey, then don’t add anything to it. Simply pour a 1.5  fl oz (44 mL) serving of room temperature Jameson into a rocks glass or other drinking vessel, and enjoy! You can pour a larger serving if you prefer. Just remember that whiskey is a very strong drink so it is best to drink only a small amount at a time. If you want to chill your Jameson, use a large ice cube. Using multiple small ice cubes will quickly dilute the Jameson and cool down the alcohol which this will mute the flavor. To make Jameson cold without adding too much water, add a large cube-shaped or spherical ice cube to the glass.  You can purchase special ice cube trays for whiskey. Check culinary stores and online retailers to find a large spherical or cube-shaped ice tray. If you want to chill Jameson without water, then purchase a set of whiskey rocks. These are granite or stainless steel cubes that you freeze and add to whiskey in place of ice. Add about 0.5  fl oz (15 ml) of water, then taste the Jameson to see if this makes it easier for you to drink. If it still tastes too strong, add another 0.5  fl oz (15 ml) of water and taste it again. Repeat until the Jameson tastes how you want it to. You may find it easier to detect subtle flavors in the whiskey even after adding a few drops of water. Put your mouth on the glass as if you are going to take a sip and tip the glass so that your nose is in it. Then, take a deep breath in through your nose to inhale the scent of the Jameson. Take a small sip and let the sip linger on your tongue for a moment before you swallow. Common scents and flavors you might notice include toffee, vanilla, and caramel. Because Jameson is so strong, it is best to sip the entire drink slowly. Take your time and savor the flavors and scent of the Jameson. You can hold the glass in your hands while drinking to keep it warm or set it down if you have added ice to your drink.","output":"A rocks glass is a special little cup that can hold 6 to 10 ounces (180 to 300 mL) of a drink, usually used for whiskey like Jameson. These glasses can be pretty and sometimes come with a special container for whiskey. You can drink whiskey from any kind of cup, even a coffee mug or a plastic one. It's best to not add anything to the whiskey if you want to taste all its flavors. To enjoy it, pour a small serving and drink slowly. If you want a cold drink, use big ice cubes, special ice trays, or cool rock-like things that you can freeze. Adding a little bit of water might make the whiskey taste better. When drinking, smell it first and try to notice sweet smells like toffee, vanilla, and caramel.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Most of the time, we choose colors for decorating based on our personal taste and our sense of aesthetics  . But, a number of color experts believe that colors have an effect on our emotions and that it would be wise of us to be conscious of that before settling on a definite choice. Some of the effects of colors are well known and accepted by most people. In fact, those effects have been the subject of serious research and experiments and have been scientifically proven. But not all scientists agree on the validity   of the results. When we become interested in the psychological effects of colors, it is important to know that not all societies share our opinion of those effects on our emotions. What we hold as an \\"objective\\" observation on a color is often nothing more than a reflection of our cultural belongingness, which has attributed properties to that color for generations. Why is it not possible for us to hold a really objective discourse on the subject? In part, because it is very difficult to separate the psychological from the symbolic, the symbolic aspects are definitely cultural. Often, and this without our realizing it, they influence our understanding of colors and the following emotions - both psychological aspects. Black and white are good examples. In western countries, black is considered serious, dramatic and sometimes sad. People are warned against its potentially depressing effects on decoration. Black is the traditional color of mourning. White, on the other hand, is associated with purity, peace and optimism. For those reasons, white is the traditional color of bridal dresses. No one would think of attending a funeral in white. Any more than it would occur to a bride to wear black. We simply remain convinced that it is not in the \\"nature\\" of those colors.

The app has undoubtedly proven to be a useful addition to my daily smartphone experience, but there are some areas where I believe it could be even better. Firstly, I appreciate the convenience that the Home Button Launcher app brings to my device. The app allows me to customize and quickly access my frequently used apps right from the home button, saving me time and hassle. The interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, which is a huge plus and reflects the developer's attention to detail. Another feature I truly enjoy is the ability to create shortcuts to specific app actions. This has made it much easier for me to streamline tasks like sending an email or composing a new message on my messaging apps. However, I have experienced occasional minor bugs in the app, such as the app icons disappearing from the launcher once in a while. While this does not directly impact functionality, it can be a little annoying at times.

It causes either watery diarrhea or, in more severe cases, bloody diarrhea that can lead to other complications such as kidney failure. E. coli infections occur most frequently while traveling to areas of the world with poorer hygiene than we have here in North America. It is transmitted via fecal contamination of food, water, etc. Symptoms of an E. coli infection include:  Abdominal pain Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Fever Abdominal cramps It is important to understand that E. coli infections are not able to be \\"cured\\" (and the bacteria cannot be \\"killed\\") with typical medical drugs such as antibiotics or even antidiarrheals. Rather, the treatment offered by medical professionals is \\"supportive,\\" meaning it consists of rest, fluids, and medications for symptom management such as pain and/or nausea.  This is counter-intuitive for many people, who often expect medical drugs as a \\"cure\\" for illnesses such as an E. coli infection. Antidiarrheal medications are not helpful because they delay the passage of the infection and a worsening of symptoms. Your best bet, counter-intuitive as it may seem, is to allow the diarrhea to continue to get rid of the infection as soon as possible.  Antibiotics are also not recommended — they have been shown to worsen the illness, because when the bacteria are killed they release more toxins, resulting in greater damage. Because antibiotics are not advised in E. coli infections, it will be up to your immune system to kill off the infection. Fortunately, your immune system is very capable of doing this, given adequate time and proper support. Rest, follow your doctor's instructions, and allow your immune system to do its job! Talk to your doctor about the supportive measures you can take to get through the infection. It will be important to stay hydrated as you will be losing lots of fluids while you are sick. Summary:","output":"E. coli primarily affects the gastrointestinal tracts in adults, causing watery or bloody diarrhea that can result in complications like kidney failure. Infections usually occur when traveling to areas with poorer hygiene and are transmitted through fecal contamination of food and water. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Unlike common belief, E. coli infections cannot be cured with antibiotics or antidiarrheals. Treatment focuses on supportive measures such as rest, fluids, and symptom management. Antidiarrheal medications can delay recovery, while antibiotics may worsen the condition by releasing more toxins. Therefore, allowing the immune system to combat the infection naturally with adequate time and support is crucial. It is vital to follow a doctor's advice, stay hydrated, and allow the immune system to tackle the infection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the three habitats that are designated as a red-zone area? from the following article ?  The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes. Blakeney Point, along with Holme Dunes and Holkham dunes, is considered to be a sensitive habitat already suffering from visitor pressure, and therefore designated...

Ampulla of Vater Various smooth muscle sphincters regulate the flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the ampulla: the sphincter of the pancreatic duct, the sphincter of the bile duct, and the sphincter of Oddi. Is this statement correct \\"does the ampulla of vater only contain pancreatic juice\\"?","output":"To determine if this statement is correct, let's examine each component of the ampulla of Vater: 1. Ampulla of Vater: The ampulla of Vater, also known as the hepatopancreatic ampulla, is an important structure that connects the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct to the duodenum (small intestine's second part). 2. Pancreatic duct: This duct carries pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes, from the pancreas to the duodenum. The enzymatic content in pancreatic juice aids in breaking down nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. 3. Common bile duct: This duct carries bile from the liver and the gallbladder to the duodenum. Bile, which contains bile acids, aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fats. 4. Sphincters: Three major sphincters control the passage of fluids (pancreatic juice and bile) through the ampulla of Vater. These include the sphincter of the pancreatic duct, the sphincter of the bile duct, and the sphincter of Oddi. Now, let's analyze the statement: \\"Does the ampulla of Vater only contain pancreatic juice?\\" Based on the information provided, we can conclude that the statement is not correct. The ampulla of Vater contains not only pancreatic juice but also bile. Both pancreatic juice and bile have distinct roles in the digestion process, and they mix within the ampulla before entering the duodenum. The various smooth muscle sphincters (sphincter of the pancreatic duct, sphincter of the bile duct, and the sphincter of Oddi) regulate the flow of these fluids through the ampulla."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It has been a while since we last touched base on the progress of our California projects, and I wanted to take a moment to provide you with an update, as well as share some significant developments that have taken place recently. As always, your support and continued interest in these projects is greatly appreciated. Firstly, our team has successfully completed the rollout of the new solar power generation system in the Southern California region. I am thrilled to report that the installation finished ahead of schedule and under budget, and that the system is already generating clean, renewable energy at an impressive rate. The local community has shown immense enthusiasm for this initiative, and we can proudly announce that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the area has already begun. In terms of our affordable housing initiative in the Bay Area, we have secured the necessary permits to move forward with construction, and groundbreaking is slated for the end of this month. We have identified two viable locations for these developments, both of which are in close proximity to public transportation and essential services, ensuring accessibility and convenience for future residents. We will be working closely with the local community throughout the construction process, as well as creating job opportunities for residents. Speaking of job opportunities, our job training and placement program has achieved exceptional results thus far. Since its inception, we have managed to assist over 300 individuals in securing stable employment, vastly improving their prospects for a brighter future. Moreover, approximately 75% of these participants have managed to retain their positions for a period of six months or more, which serves as a testament to the program's impact and success. Lastly, we are excited to announce that our partnership with the California State Parks system is entering a new phase. Over the past few months, our team has been working diligently to identify potential park improvements and develop a strategy for their implementation. As a result, we will be moving ahead with plans to enhance park facilities, including upgrades to playground equipment, picnic areas, and trail systems. These enhancements will undoubtedly contribute to a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience for park visitors. As we forge ahead with these projects, your input and engagement is invaluable. If you have any questions or would like further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. We also encourage you to share this email with any colleagues or associates who may be interested in our endeavors in California.

The centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire, led to numerous Ottoman–Persian Wars. The Safavid Era peaked in the reign of Abbas the Great, 1587–1629, surpassing their Ottoman arch rivals in strength, and making the empire a leading hub in Western Eurasia for the sciences and arts. The Safavid Era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s, which was caused by the internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722.

Summarize this article: PARKLAND, Fla. - Panicked parents searching for students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a shooter killed 17 people Wednesday in Parkland, were sharing their children's photos on social media and asking for help.      Michelle Wiseman was among the 2,840 Facebook users who shared the photo of Jaime Guttenberg, before the post was removed. Her parents, Fred and Jennifer Guttenberg, later learned that Jaime died in the shooting, while their son, Jesse, made it home.      Jaime Guttenberg, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was killed in the Feb. 14 shooting at the school in Parkland.      \\"Praying for all of the families and kids,\\" Wiseman wrote.      The Broward Sheriff's Office had yet to release the identities of the 17 dead or the 17 who were rushed to Broward Health North, Broward Medical Center, Broward Health Coral Springs and West Boca Medical Center. Authorities identified the suspected gunman as Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former troubled student at the school.      Broward Health Medical Center received seven patients, out of which two were in life-threatening condition. Broward Health North received eight patients and one suspect. Three were in life-threatening condition and two died. Broward Health Coral Springs received one patient with non-life threatening injuries.      It wasn't easy to get updates on social media, because most of the students posting on Snapchat and Instagram were using pseudonyms. A Twitter user known as \\"The Captain Aidan\\" published unidentifiable photos of himself and other students in a classroom. They were all sitting on the floor using their cellphones.      \\"My school is being shot up and I am locked inside,\\" he wrote. \\"I’m f---- scared right now ... Please don't just send your love to me, but pray for the victims' families too,\\" he wrote. \\"Love you all.\\"      He later identified himself as a freshman and shared photos outside of the school where other parents were frantically waiting for updates. He also tweeted he and his brother were safe and with their parents in the car.      Chad Reidlinger, a friend of the Winkander family, shared a photo of Ben Wikander, a senior who hadn't contacted anyone Wednesday afternoon.

According to Douglas football coach Willis May, Feis’ family was notified around midnight Wednesday or very early Thursday morning. In a news conference late Wednesday night, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel referenced a football coach dying, but did not give a name.      Social media accounts throughout the day called Feis a hero, saying he was shot while helping a student. May said he heard directly from a student that Feis jumped between her and the shooter, to push her out through a door and out of the line of fire.      “It is with Great sadness that our Football Family has learned about the death of Aaron Feis,” the Douglas football team’s Twitter account posted early Thursday morning. “He was our Assistant Football Coach and security guard. He selflessly shielded students from the shooter when he was shot. He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories.”      Feis, in his capacity as a school security guard, responded to the original call on the school’s security radio walkie-talkies. Someone asked on the radio if the loud sounds heard were firecrackers, according to May, who also carries a radio.      “I heard Aaron say, ‘No, that is not firecrackers.’ That’s the last I heard of him,” May said.      May was in his football office at the time of the shooting and went into a lockdown mode with four football players and two coaches from Nichols College, who were recruiting at the school when Mays heard “Code Red” over the intercom. He added they later saw the shooter outside the office window, trying to blend in with students evacuating.      As for Feis, May talked about a man he worked with and cared for deeply.      “Big ol’ teddy bear,” May said of Feis. “Hardcore – he coached hard. Real good line. He did a great job with the [offensive] line. He took pride with working with those guys. Loyalty – I trusted him. He had my back. He worked hard. Just a good man. Loved his family. Loved his brother – just an excellent family man.”      Earlier in the day, Douglas junior lineman Charlie Rothkopf tweeted a picture of Feis with the text: “Can everyone please take a second to pray for my coach today he took serval bullets covering other students at Douglas.”      It was one of many social media tributes to Feis that floated around Wednesday in the aftermath of the shooting.      “He was a great guy,” said sophomore Douglas lineman Gage Gaynor. “Everyone loved him. Shame he had to go like this. Always gave his all to making us better. Definitely learned a lot from him.”      In addition to coaching linemen, Feis served as the school’s junior varsity football coach for eight years, according to his bio on the football team’s website. He also played a role in football operations and was the team’s college recruiting coordinator.      Feis played center for the Eagles from 1995-98. A 1999 graduate of Douglas, he first returned to his alma mater as a coach in 2002.      He resided in Coral Springs and leaves behind a wife named Melissa and a daughter, according to his bio.      dfurones@sunsentinel.com / @DavidFurones_      Correspondent Gary Curreri contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"In the aftermath of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed, parents and friends of students turned to social media to locate and receive updates on their loved ones.

It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.  - A video game genre is a classification assigned to a video game based on its gameplay interaction rather than visual or narrative differences. A video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges and are classified independent of their setting or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as films or books. For example, a shooter game is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space.  - First-person shooter (FPS) is a video game genre which is centered on gun and projectile weapon-based combat through a first-person perspective; that is, the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist. The first-person shooter shares common traits with other shooter games, which in turn fall under the heading action game. From the genre's inception, advanced 3D or pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has been integral.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was launched March 25, 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB and ceased operations in December 2005.  - In the history of video games, the sixth-generation era (sometimes referred to as the 128-bit era; see \\"Bits and system power\\" below) refers to the computer and video games, video game consoles, and video game handhelds available at the turn of the 21st century which was from 1998 to 2008. Platforms of the sixth generation include the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Microsoft Xbox. This era began on November 27, 1998 with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast, and it was joined by the PlayStation 2 in March 2000 and the GameCube and Xbox in 2001. The Dreamcast was discontinued in 2001, the GameCube in 2007, Xbox in 2009 and PlayStation 2 in 2013. Though the seventh generation of consoles started in November 2005 with the launch of the Xbox 360, the sixth generation did not end until January 2013, when Sony announced that the PlayStation 2 had been discontinued worldwide.  - The PlayStation 2 (abbreviated as PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to the PlayStation, and is the second installment in the PlayStation lineup of consoles.

This document was more holistic than any President Kennedy had offered, and therefore more controversial. It aimed not only to integrate public facilities, but also private businesses that sold to the public, such as motels, restaurants, theaters, and gas stations. Public schools, hospitals, libraries, parks, among other things, were included in the bill as well. It also worked with JFK's executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate. Maybe most significant of all, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act aimed to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees. Another provision established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation's workplace.:74 Now answer this question: What was the purpose of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?","output":"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had a critical and far-reaching purpose: to end discrimination in employment across the United States. More specifically, it aimed to prohibit employers, both public and private, from engaging in discriminatory practices based on an individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The primary target of Title VII was any firm employing 25 or more employees, ensuring that a significant portion of the American workforce would be protected from discriminatory actions. Under Title VII, employers were prohibited from making decisions related to hiring, firing, promotions, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment based on any of the aforementioned protected categories. Additionally, the legislation prohibited employers from retaliating against employees who either opposed discriminatory practices or filed charges of discrimination. Title VII also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as the federal agency responsible for implementing, enforcing, and interpreting the provisions of the Civil Rights Act concerning workplace discrimination. The EEOC was granted the authority to investigate allegations of discrimination, initiate lawsuits intending to end discriminatory practices, and provide guidance to employers on how to comply with the provisions of the Act. In conclusion, the purpose of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was to address and eliminate the pervasive issue of employment discrimination in the United States by explicitly outlawing specific discriminatory practices and establishing an enforcement mechanism through the creation of the EEOC. This groundbreaking legislation fundamentally transformed the nation's workforce, promoting equal opportunities for all employees regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To test the effect of volcanic eruption on sea level scientists measured geological data through carbon dating. They measured the data for four different time point - for year 998, year 1000, year 1002, and year 1010. Scientists now need to compare and analyze these data.  But I can use this background: As the thermal expansion is the key factor to the sea level variability, decreased heat content should result in a reduction in global mean sea levelon a decadal time scale.[2] However, Grinsted [2007] argued that a significant sea level rise is the first direct response to the volcanic eruption, and after that sea level becomes to drop. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the imbalance of ocean mass fluxes. After the volcano eruption, evaporation over ocean becomes lower, because it is largely determined by the ocean skin temperature change. The quick response of evaporation to the surface cooling and the delayed response of river runoff to the associated lower precipitation lead to an increased sea level. About 1~2 years later, river discharge becomes less due to the reduced precipitation and less sea ice melting, which cause sea level to drop.[9]  What is an answer for this question: According to Grinsted, would the sea level increase or decrease right after year 1000?","output":"According to Grinsted, the sea level would initially increase right after the volcanic eruption in year 1000."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969.

Which method do paleontologists most likely use to determine the forms of life that existed millions of years ago? What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Pick your answer from:  1). examine current species of plants and animals.  2). research past species in the library.  3). interview older scientists.  4). examine fossils records.","output":"The correct answer to the question is option 4: examine fossil records. Paleontologists are scientists who specialize in the study of past life on Earth, focusing primarily on the remains of plants, animals, and other organisms that have been preserved in the Earth's crust. Fossil records offer the most reliable and direct evidence of the existence of these prehistoric life forms. Here is a detailed explanation of why option 4 is the correct answer and why the other choices are not: 1) Examine current species of plants and animals: While examining current species may provide some insights into the evolutionary history of life on Earth, it does not offer direct evidence of the specific life forms that existed millions of years ago. It is essential for paleontologists to study fossils to trace back the evolutionary lineage of organisms and identify the ancient species that once thrived on our planet. 2) Research past species in the library: Although libraries contain resources that can provide valuable context and background information on extinct species, they are not the primary method by which paleontologists determine the forms of life that existed millions of years ago. These scientific researchers rely heavily on the discovery and analysis of fossils, which are the tangible remains or traces of ancient organisms. By studying the physical characteristics of fossils, paleontologists can better understand the anatomy, ecology, and behavior of long-extinct life forms. 3) Interview older scientists: While consulting with other scientists can be helpful in the sharing of knowledge, skills, and techniques, it is not the most reliable method of determining the forms of life that existed millions of years ago. The information that older scientists possess would still be based on the study of fossils and related research. Therefore, the primary method of discovering ancient life forms would still be the examination of fossil records. 4) Examine fossil records: This is the correct answer. Fossils provide the most direct and concrete evidence of past life and allow paleontologists to study these extinct organisms. Fossil records include not only the preserved remains of ancient plants and animals but also traces such as footprints, burrows, and impressions that reveal information about their behavior and ecology. Analyzing the geological context in which a fossil is found can also provide crucial information about the organism's environment and possible reasons for its extinction. In conclusion, paleontologists most likely use the examination of fossil records as the primary method to determine the forms of life that existed millions of years ago. This method offers the most direct evidence of ancient species and their evolutionary processes, allowing scientists to reconstruct the history of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: James hated getting in line.

People whose sugar intake is about a quarter or more of their total daily calories had twice the risk of dying from heart disease than those who whose intake was 7 percent, according to the research today in JAMA Internal Medicine. For those whose intake of added sugar was about 19 percent, their risk of dying from heart disease was about 38 percent higher.      Today’s study is the first to link on a national level the amount of sugar American adults eat to their risk of dying from heart disease after taking into account weight, age, health, exercise and diet, said lead study author Quanhe Yang, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Research has already linked sugar consumption to diabetes, weight gain and obesity.      “Too much sugar can make you fat; it can also make you sick, sick from diseases like cardiovascular disease, which is the No. 1 killer in America,” said Laura Schmidt, a school of medicine professor at the University of California at San Francisco, in a telephone interview. “Small amounts of sugar are fine. It’s consuming massive amounts of sugar that’s a growing problem in America.”      The study also found that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, seven servings or more each week, was linked to an increased risk of dying from heart disease.      600,000 Deaths      Heart disease, which can cause heart attack, chest pain and heart failure, is the leading cause of death worldwide for both men and women and kills more than 600,000 Americans each year, according to the Atlanta-based CDC.      There is no specific national guideline for sugar consumption. The Institute of Medicine recommends sugar be less than 25 percent of total calories, the World Health Organization recommends less than 10 percent, while the American Heart Association suggests limiting sugar to less than 150 calories a day for men and less than 100 calories a day for women, the authors wrote.      ‘The majority of us are consuming more added sugar than the recommendations,’’ Yang said in a telephone interview.      About 37 percent of added sugar in U.S. diets comes from sugar-sweetened beverages, while the rest comes from grain-based desserts, fruit drinks, dairy desserts and candy, the authors said. Sugar from fresh fruits and vegetables isn’t considered added sugar.      Better food labels would help people identify their sugar intake, said Schmidt, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.      Sugar Effects      Scientists don’t have a clear understanding why sugar may raise the risk of dying from heart disease, Yang said. Sugar may increase blood pressure and weight gain, both risk factors for heart disease, or it may raise bad cholesterol and triglycerides and lower good cholesterol. Sugar may also increase insulin resistance, a factor in diabetes, or increase fat accumulation in the liver, he said.      Researchers in the study looked at data from several National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which provides nationally representative information on U.S. adults.      They found that U.S. adults consumed about 14.9 percent of daily calories from added sugar in 2005-2010, down from 16.8 percent in 1999-2004. For most U.S. adults, added sugar made up 10 percent or more of their daily calories during 2005-2010 and for 10 percent of people, sugar made up 25 percent or more of their daily calories.      Today’s findings support recommendations to limit intake of sugar-added foods and drinks, Yang said.      “We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in research on the health effects of sugar, one fueled by extremely high rates of added sugar overconsumption in the American public,” Schmidt said in an editorial accompanying the study.

During his career , Vikelides was capped 7 times by the Greek National Football Team , scoring 4 goals . Vikelidis coached Aris Thessaloniki twice in 1954 and 1959 and later continued his managing career with PAOK during the 1957 season and Apollon Kalamaria during the 1961 season . In his honour , Aris FC named the stadium at Charilaou , Thessaloniki Kleanthis Vikelides Stadium .  - Central Macedonia is one of the thirteen administrative regions of Greece, consisting of the central part of the geographical and historical region of Macedonia. With a population of almost 1.9 million, it is the second most populous in Greece after Attica.  - The Ludovisi Ares is an Antonine Roman marble sculpture of Mars, a fine 2nd-century copy of a late 4th-century BCE Greek original, associated with Scopas or Lysippus: thus the Roman god of war receives his Greek name, Ares.  - Yellow is the color between green and orange in the spectrum of visible light. It is the color of ripe lemons, sunflowers, and gold. It is a primary color in subtractive color, used in color printing. According to surveys in Europe, Canada, and the United States, yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, and spontaneity, but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, avarice, and, in the U.S., with cowardice. It plays an important role in Asian culture, particularly in China, where it is seen as the color of happiness, glory, wisdom, harmony, and culture.  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires.

The club is named after Ares, the ancient Greek God of War, but also associated with courage and masculinity, inspired by the successful military operations of the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars, and the liberation of Thessaloniki in 1912 from the Ottoman empire. Its image (as depicted in the Ludovisi Ares) is portrayed on the club's emblem.  - Thessaloniki is the second-largest city in Greece and the capital of Greek Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace. Its nickname is   (\\"Symprotévousa\\"), literally \\"the co-capital\\", a reference to its historical status as the  (\\"Symvasilévousa\\") or \\"co-reigning\\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople.  - Black is the darkest color resulting from the absence or complete absorption of light. Like white and grey, it is an achromatic color, literally a color without hue. It is one of the four primary colors in the CMYK color model, along with cyan, yellow, and magenta, used in color printing to produce all the other colors. Black is often used to represent darkness; it is the symbolic opposite of white (or brightness).  - The Greek national football team represents Greece in association football and is controlled by the Hellenic Football Federation, the governing body for football in Greece. Greece's home ground is Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus. Greece is one of only ten national teams to have been crowned UEFA European Champions.  - The Hellenic Football Federation (HFF); also known as the Greek Football Federation is the governing body of football in Greece. It contributes in the organisation of Super League Greece and organizes the Greek football Cup and the Greece national football team. It is based in Athens.  - The Balkan Wars (literally \\"the Balkan Wars\\" or \\"Balkan Facias\\", meaning \\"the Balkan Tragedy\\") consisted of two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the first war; one of the four, Bulgaria, suffered defeat in the second war. The Ottoman Empire lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples. The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus served as a \\"prelude to the First World War\\".  - The Kingdom of Greece (Greek: , \\"Vasíleion ts Elládos\\") was a state established in 1832 at the Convention of London by the Great Powers (the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire). It was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Constantinople, where it also secured full independence from the Ottoman Empire. This event also marked the birth of the first, fully independent, Greek state since the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in the mid-15th century.  - Ares is the Greek god of war. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera. In Greek literature, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war, in contrast to his sister the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship.  - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror.  - Football is a highly popular sport in Greece. History of Greek football. The Ancient Greeks are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game \\"harpastum\\" is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as \\"\\" (\\"Episkyros\\") or \\"\\" (\\"phaininda\\"), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c.150-c.215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.  - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf.

You are given a new situation: David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D.  and a hint : Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity.  Please answer this question : If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, are they closer or farther? Answer:","output":"If the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, they are closer together. Justification: 1. According to the hint provided, when two negative charges (like charge A and charge B) are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. 2. As the two negative charges move apart, their potential energy decreases since the repulsive force between them also decreases due to increased distance. 3. Consequently, if the potential energy between charge A and charge B increases, it means that the repulsive force between them is stronger, indicating that they are closer together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How can I get peace of mind? How do I find peace of mind? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Pick your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","output":"b). yes Both of these questions indicate a desire to achieve a state of mental and emotional calmness or tranquility, so they are essentially the same question. Now, let's dive into ways you can find peace of mind. 1. Mindfulness and meditation: Setting aside time every day for mindfulness meditation can significantly help in achieving peace of mind. Meditation helps in quieting the chatter in your mind and encourages you to stay in the present moment, without judgment. Start with just a few minutes a day and gradually increase the duration. 2. Acceptance: Accepting that certain situations or events might be beyond your control can help in achieving peace of mind. Embrace imperfections and accept that life is full of surprises - this will help you cope better with uncertainty. 3. Stay organized: Keep your life organized by decluttering your living and workspaces, creating to-do lists, and setting realistic goals to reduce stress and clutter, which can further increase your peace of mind. 4. Regular exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, reduces stress, and can help clear negative thoughts. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. 5. Connect with nature: Spending time outdoors and in nature can help in grounding yourself and finding peace of mind. Find a quiet spot in a park or by the water where you can sit and reflect on your thoughts and emotions. 6. Practice gratitude: Cultivate a habit of expressing gratitude for what you have, rather than constantly seeking more. Keep a gratitude journal to record positive experiences, and try to focus on the positive aspects of your life. 7. Develop healthy relationships: Surround yourself with positive people who support and encourage your growth. Eliminate toxic relationships that may add stress and negativity to your life. 8. Seek help when necessary: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family members, or professionals if you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed. Seeking help can be an important step towards achieving peace of mind. 9. Limit exposure to technology: Overuse of technology can be a significant source of anxiety and stress. Limit the time spent on electronic devices, especially social media, and take periodic breaks throughout the day. 10. Engage in hobbies and activities: Participate in activities that bring you joy and help you express your creativity, such as painting, writing, swimming, or gardening. Engaging in hobbies can act as a form of therapy and help in achieving peace of mind. Remember that achieving peace of mind is a journey and not a destination. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small successes along the way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Warped take on the Pinocchio theme, and set during the Christmas season(..after the previous entry abandoned ties to Christmas) has booby-trapped toys sent to murder a child(..yet through this, other victims are accidentally harmed in the process)perhaps by a toy maker's \\"son\\". Screaming Mad George was responsible for the killer toys(..including a larvae which enters a victim's mouth and out his eye, another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy, operating from a remote control). The little target is a mute child named Derek(William Thorne)whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face, causing him to land on a fireplace poker. Mother Sarah(Jane Higginson)worries about her son's mental state, figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or, more importantly, talking, derives from watching her husband's horrific murder. Derek's real father, Noah(Tracy Fraim)fears for his son't safety, and informs, reluctantly, his ex-girlfriend Sarah that the local toymaker, Joe Petto(Mickey Rooney)once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash..kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn't have a son, then others shouldn't either. Still quite a heavy drinker(..often seen swigging Jack), Petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids, but his creepy son Pino(Brian Bremer)hasn't and Derek he harbors angst towards. Why? You'll soon understand. Pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise. Rooney's name adds an allure to the film, gaining it a notoriety, but his histrionics can only help so much. Attractive lead actress Higginson(Slaughterhouse)and Fraim as the man who re-enters her life aren't so bad, but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously. I'm guessing that's the point, but Rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this..he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation, quite volatile, barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards Pino, when not downing liquor. Bremer is appropriately weird and \\"robotic\\" as Pino, longing to have Sarah as his mama. The practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing..Screaming Mad George's work with Savage Steve Holland was far more effective than what we see in this film. The sex everyone talks about isn't as gratuitous as many would have you believe(..I can't even recall any nudity). Probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted, but that's not exactly an endorsement. I'm pretty sure written on paper, this was an entertaining concept, the idea of spoofing Pinocchio using horror elements, but the result doesn't exactly blow you away.

Article:Last March, the government appointed former health minister Lord Norman Warner as external commissioner to oversee the running of children's services. Ministers have had his progress report since April, but will not say when it will be released. One young woman's experience of being in the care of the authority saw her being moved 39 times in just five years and raped several times while in care. Danielle, who has waived her right to anonymity, was taken into care in 1998 at the age of 11, after slash marks from a belt were spotted on her back when she changed for PE at school. She told BBC Inside Out West Midlands the first of the 39 moves she went through saw her transferred six times in the first six weeks. \\"I don't think any of us ever felt safe,\\" Danielle, who is now in her 20s, said. \\"Half of us ran away because it was safer to run away than to be in the home sometimes.\\" When she was 11 years old, she said, someone tried to rape her in the children's home she was staying in and aged 13 she ran away. \\"[I] got tricked into going to this flat and I got locked in. \\"Then he started calling people and they kept me there for hours and I got gang raped. They locked me in a cupboard and wouldn't let me go.\\" By the time she left the care system at the age of 16, Danielle had been raped three times. As she left in 2003, a new director of children's services was appointed in Birmingham. Peter Hay inherited a zero-rated service that was already on a government watch list, where it has remained. \\"The first stage I think was to stop the thing falling off a cliff,\\" he said. But high-profile cases have continued to come, including those of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, who starved to death at her home in Handsworth in 2008, and Keanu Williams, who in 2011 was found collapsed in his mother's partner's flat. Their deaths are among 23 serious case reviews published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006. Between 2009 and October 2013, the authority had four different strategic directors of Children, Young People and Families. Mr Hay, who was in charge until 2006, before returning to oversee the department in 2013, said at the time of Keanu's death the council had been going through \\"an eight-year period of sustained failure\\" in spite of the previous warnings. Ofsted branded the service a \\"national disgrace\\" after the boy's death. The government warned the authority it was considering taking over the running of the department, but instead appointed Lord Warner. 23 Serious case reviews in Birmingham since 2006 7 Years Birmingham children's services has been rated inadequate Â£9.2m  Pledged by the city council in 2014 to improve the department 161 Social worker posts unfilled by permanent staff in January Four months after he started, a new, integrated agency hub was created to speed up the safeguarding process. Birmingham Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (Mash) is based inside the council's headquarters and is made up of many organisations, including police, social workers and the NHS. Christine Wellington, Mash head of service, said: \\"Pre-Mash there was no feedback, there was almost the sense of 'what's the point of referring if nothing is going to be done?'.\\" Now, when a safeguarding call comes in, it takes priority and the various agencies get together to discuss what action to take. But one social worker who has worked for the council on more than one occasion - in 2012 and again this year - said his experiences had put him off going back. The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said during his most recent time there, managers were being sacked, asked to leave and resigning, on a weekly basis. He said he was \\"fearful of a child death or a serious incident happening on my watch and I want to be able to sleep at night\\". The council has said a recruitment crisis in the department has been turned around - in contrast to May last year, when more than a quarter of frontline social worker posts were unfilled. Social worker Siobhan Patton said her case load is the lowest it has ever been, down from 30 to 10. And she said that was a big change from her \\"lowest point\\" - working from 06:00 until midnight. Despite the council having to save millions of pounds from several departments, the authority has invested Â£30m in children's services over the past two years, which Mr Hay said was \\"a real sign of that commitment to make this the number one service the council provides\\".

The guy in charge of making sure children like Danielle are safe in the city of Birmingham was called Mr. Hay. However, even though he was trying to make things better, there were still some big problems and other kids also suffered. The government said they were thinking about taking over the job of looking after these services from Mr. Hay and the other leaders in Birmingham. Instead of doing that, they chose Lord Warner, another important guy, to help out. Now, they have a new way of doing things called 'Mash' in Birmingham. Different groups like the police and health care workers come together to talk about what they can do to help when a call about the safety of a child comes in. But, some people who work there don't think things are going well and are worried something bad could happen. At one point, they didn't even have enough social workers, who are people that help children in need. Things seem to be better now, with less work for each social worker. As for the money part, the leaders have put more money into these services, which is a good sign that they're trying to make things better for children.

I then decided to clean ALL the dishes one week and lay the ground rule that *anyone leaving dishes on the counter(where we all prep food in our tiny kitchen) or in the sink longer than 3 days will be liable to have them put out of the kitchen and into their personal space, unless they know of a better solution that doesn't result in other people having to do *someone else's dishes. I made it known I was fine being held to this standard myself, and was very fine working with any other solution that didn't mean others having to do my dishes or vice versa- really anything with some enforcement method. A couple weeks go by, and some dishes are stuck in the middle of the food prep counter, so I bagged them and put them on the stool, to a ranting tyrade over our group chat from roommate in question.

There was also a group of settlers that arrived from the colony of Bermuda. These settlers played a significant role in establishing the first permanent English-speaking populations in present-day Duval County, Baker County, St. Johns County, and Nassau County. By offering land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War, the British government managed to attract settlers with the promise of economic opportunities and the abundance of natural resources in the region. Upon settling in Florida, the British colonists built quality public roads and introduced a variety of crops, including sugar cane, indigo, and various fruits.

Answer: A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking for a method that feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks while avoiding the need for each light to have a line-to-low voltage transformer. Step 2: Consider possible methods There are various methods to supply power to low voltage lighting systems, one of which is cable lighting. Step 3: Evaluate the methods Cable lighting is a modified version of track lighting where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension. Instead of individual transformers, this method utilizes a central transformer to power all the lights on the cable. Step 4: Formulate the answer A centralized transformer in a cable lighting system feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks, eliminating the need for each light to have a line-to-low voltage transformer. Step 5: Review the initial answer and compare Comparing the initial answer and the formulated one, it can be seen that the initial answer is mostly satisfactory. However, it could be improved by mentioning the central transformer explicitly, as it is a key aspect of the system.

In this system, lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension, and a central transformer powers all the lights on the cable."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Isabella Stewart was born in New York City in 1840. Her father made a great deal of money in trade. During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised  every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston. In her will, she left the museum a million dollars and a series of requirements about how it should be managed. One requirement is that the permanent collection cannot be changed.

GOP failing to learn race lessons Editor's note: Crystal Wright runs the blog ConservativeBlackChick.com. She also is a principal at the Baker Wright Group, a communications and public relations firm. You can follow her on Twitter @GOPBlackChick. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. That was the Republican Party's own take on the 2012 election as it acknowledged in an autopsy report (otherwise known as the Growth & Opportunity Project) that it was failing to appeal to minority voters. Unfortunately, too many Republicans have already forgotten this lesson, a reality made all the clearer by the response to recent revelations that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise spoke to a white supremacist group 12 years ago. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was just one of those who seemed more interested in making excuses than holding Republicans to the standard they had supposedly set for themselves. Appearing on CBS' \\"Face the Nation,\\" Gingrich brushed off the accusations, suggesting it was a \\"stupidly\\" scheduled meeting, while noting that President Barack Obama attended the church of the racially divisive Rev. Jeremiah Wright for 20 years. Gingrich also attempted to pivot to the media's treatment of Democrats with racist records. \\"You have (Sen. Robert) Byrd who was the majority leader and a Klan leader. You have Hugo Black, who was a justice, who was a Klan leader. But they were Democrats and being in the Klan was OK,\\" Gingrich lectured. Actually, none of that was OK. But this isn't about Democrats -- it's about the racist undercurrent that has been corrupting the GOP for decades, and the fact that the party's establishment has too often looked the other way. Unfortunately, it feels like every time a Republican is caught behaving like a racist in the 21st century, prominent members of the GOP try to change the subject to Democrats behaving badly instead of denouncing what is going on. What exactly did Scalise do to deserve the opprobrium that critics have justifiably heaped on him? Well, in 2002, as a Louisiana state representative, Scalise spoke to the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, founded by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. Scalise alleges a staffer scheduled the appearance and that he wasn't aware of the group's, uh, \\"divisive racial and religious views,\\" as he wrote in a statement. Yet Scalise's claims of plausible deniability just don't add up. Exclusive: Duke threatens to name names 00:33 For a start, The Washington Post reported that Kenny Knight, his neighbor at the time and a longtime Duke adviser, requested Scalise speak to the group and said Scalise \\"knew who I was, but I don't think he held it against me.\\" But we don't even need to look to someone else's take to get a feel for Scalise's past. In 1999, Scalise reportedly told Roll Call he shared Duke's \\"conservative\\" views but said that \\"the novelty of David Duke has worn off.\\" More recently, in 2004, Scalise voted against declaring a state holiday honoring civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Collectively, these actions don't look like those of an elected official who rejects \\"that kind of hateful bigotry,\\" as Scalise noted in his statement, but instead suggest a man trying to play politics in a state where only 13% of his congressional district's residents are black. Gingrich also told \\"Face the Nation\\" host Bob Schieffer that Mia B. Love, the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, had said Scalise has been \\"helpful\\" to her, as if this somehow negates what Scalise has done. But isn't helping out a fellow member of the GOP a pretty basic requirement of the job for someone in a leadership position? House speaker, Louisiana Democrat back Scalise 03:52 I admire Love, but the truth is that as a black woman myself, I have no idea how she could say on ABC's \\"This Week\\" that she believes Scalise \\"should remain in leadership,\\" particularly since Love doesn't appear to have had experience working directly with him. Perhaps Love was trying to show the GOP she's a team player, but she didn't do herself or the party any favors by standing by a colleague who spoke to a group whose membership would no doubt be happy if segregation had never ended. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Scalise made a \\"mistake.\\" Speaker John Boehner, for his part, called it an \\"error of judgment\\" and added that Scalise has his \\"full confidence.\\" As a black Republican, I'm tired of my party continuing to provide safe harbor to people like Scalise. Gingrich complained the media's coverage of Scalise's speech was \\"a one-sided view of reality.\\" Actually, that sounds more like a description of the GOP today. The face of the party looks as intolerant as ever as 2015 begins. Unless it starts showing \\"representatives\\" like Scalise the door, it will find itself writing another autopsy report in 2016.

If Today, a visit to the quarries, just outside town, reveals some of the secrets of how the ancient Egyptians worked the stone., can we conclude that \\"The Egyptians stonework has been one of the best kept secrets in the world, their methods still unknown.\\"?","output":"While your statement might lend an air of mystery and intrigue to ancient Egyptian stonework, it's not entirely accurate based on current archeological knowledge and understanding. The prowess of ancient Egyptians in stonework is indeed impressive, marveled at through the ages, and is a subject of many studies. Their accomplishments have stood the test of time and are visible today in the grand edifices such as the Great Pyramids, Sphinx, Obelisks, statues, and more. Although the processes and methods they used in achieving such an extraordinary level of precision and imagination in their stonework may have been initially shrouded in mystery, archaeological findings, rigorous studies, and scientific developments over years have allowed us to uncover several of their methods. Visiting the ancient quarries can certainly provide insight into how they extracted and shaped the stones. The archaeological evidence, such as the remains of tools, quarry marks, and cut-stone waste in the quarry area, help reconstruct the process of stone extraction and initial shaping. It is believed that they used tools such as hardened bronze and copper chisels, as well as a technique known as \\"fire-setting\\" wherein they would light a fire to heat the rock, then quickly cool it with water, making it far easier to break apart. Moreover, detailed studies on the ancient structures, aided by modern techniques like microscopy, chemical analysis, and geology, have offered further clarity. For instance, it is now understood that the Egyptians employed a unique method to transport the massive blocks of limestone and granite. They most likely used large sledges which were dragged over wet sand, significantly reducing the friction and making transportation of such large weights feasible. While the construction techniques from the Pyramids built around 2600 BC might not be entirely understood, the later monuments like the temples constructed during the New Kingdom period (around 1550 – 1069 BC) are better understood due to the preservation of more extensive resources and tools. Additionally, various pieces of evidence in ancient Egyptian textual material, including inscriptions, paintings, and papyri, provide further insight into their construction methods. For instance, the illustrations in the tomb of Rekhmire, a vizier during the reign of Thutmose III, distinctly represent a scene of stone-cutting. However, it is important to note that while scholars are confident about these discovered methods, some secrets of the ancient Egyptians' stonework do remain a mystery due to the lack of comprehensive and written records detailing the exact methods. The limitations in replicating the precision and finesse of their work with same ancient techniques also add to the mystery. Therefore, these points might lend some credibility to your statement. In conclusion, while we have managed to uncover a significant amount regarding ancient Egyptian stonework techniques, there are aspects of their practices that remain as yet undiscovered, keeping the intrigue alive. However, it wouldn't be entirely accurate to term it as \\"one of the best kept secrets\\" due to the considerable progress made in understanding their techniques. This field is an area of ongoing research and interpretations, and every new archaeological discovery adds a bit more to our understanding of their extraordinary skills.  Overall, continuing to explore and analyze Egypt’s ancient quarries and structures is certain to further enhance our knowledge of the ancient Egyptians' advanced construction skills and practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The brand-new experience was like having a constantly programmed movie screen in the family living room. The pleasure, the convenience-- all a person had to do was lean back and be entertained. Or so it seemed. But two men -- a pair of fledgling television producers whose names were Harry Prichett and Edwin Wyckoff -- had the foresight to realize that the screen did not necessarily have to be one-way. And that there was money to be made by encouraging people to treat the screen as something with which they could interact. Thus was born \\"Winky Dink and You\\" -- a primitive and rudimentary first step into what would eventually become the screen-obsessed world in which we live today: millions of people endlessly tapping away, sending and receiving messages, relentlessly responding to what glows in front of their eyes, regarding their screen as almost a person, a friend. \\"Winky Dink and You,\\" which aired Saturday mornings on CBS beginning in 1953, was hosted by Jack Barry and starred a sprightly, squeaky-voiced cartoon character named. . .well, you know what he was named. Winky Dink's adventures were not all that spectacular -- but it is what he asked the children watching the show to do that heralded a cultural change. Winky Dink said he wanted the children to mail away for a \\"Magic Window,\\" which was actually a cheaply produced, thin sheet of plastic that adhered to the TV screen by static electricity. \\"Send your name and address, along with 50 cents, to Winky Dink, Box 5, New York, 19, New York!\\" Those incessantly repeated words became one of the most familiar phrases in the land. Along with the plastic sheet that arrived in the mail were \\"magic crayons.\\" Children were encouraged to place the sheet on their TV screen and watch the show each Saturday, so that Winky Dink could tell them what to do. They might be instructed to draw a ladder on a certain part of the sheet, or a chimney, or a bridge. Then the action on the television screen would combine with what the children had drawn on the plastic sheet to create a narrative-in-motion. It was a sensation, for a while. Children who didn't own the magic sheet or the magic crayons felt left out -- they could watch the show, but they weren't participating in the whole experience. Winky Dink guilted them into sending in the 50 cents so they weren't deprived of what every other kid on the block was doing. The show's downfall derived from two things. According to author Billy Ingram, perhaps the world's leading Winky Dink authority, many children who didn't own the plastic sheets simply took crayons they had around the house and, on Winky Dink's cue, drew directly on the glass screens of their parents' expensive first-generation television sets. And if that didn't make the parents angry enough, there was the concern that the children, by sitting so close to the TV sets as they drew, could be exposing themselves to harmful radiation. The original show went off the air in 1957, and although there were short-lived attempts to revive it, it is now just a distant memory. But Winky Dink's influence lives on in every screen that every person today regards as a two-way window. Which brings us to Bill Gates. There is a line that occasionally pops up in Winky Dink-related literature. The line quotes Gates -- it has him crediting \\"Winky Dink and You\\" as \\"the first interactive TV show.\\" It certainly would make sense. Gates and his Windows are the logical extension of Winky Dink and his Magic Window. Winky Dink and Gates both saw the true back-and-forth possibilities of those screens. What Gates has accomplished is essentially Winky Dink writ large. Very large. But, try as I might, I was unable to locate a reliable, rock-solid citation for that quote. Was is it real -- had Gates ever actually uttered the words? Or was it merely some tall tale, repeated person-to-person by would-be believers? I contacted the Microsoft corporate offices to ask if they could verify, for the sake of posterity, that Gates had, in fact, once sung the praises of Winky Dink. I had some false starts and hit some dead ends. But then, paydirt. I was able to get in touch with a man by the name of John Pinette, who once worked for Microsoft and who now is a spokesman for Gates himself. Pinette said he had a distinct recollection of having been present at the key moment:. \\"I remember the Winky Dink speech -- but don't remember when Bill gave it (or where -- or to whom). It was a brief example of 'here's an early example of interactive TV' before he went on to a bigger presentation of Microsoft's TV efforts. \\"He had one of the plastic film sheets -- and the Winky Dink box, if I remember correctly.\\" So there it is. Gates was born in 1955, so it is unlikely that he remembers watching in first-run the original version of \\"Winky Dink and You.\\" Perhaps he saw the subsequent attempts to bring the show back; perhaps, like so many young Americans of the time, he simply found himself awash in the echoes of Winky's legend. Every creative genius is influenced by someone. Plato was influenced by Socrates. Beethoven was influenced by Mozart. William Faulkner was influenced by Mark Twain. In some future century, a new Mount Rushmore may be carved, to celebrate the figures of our own era who changed the course of the world as dramatically as any presidents or statesmen. It will be only fitting and right if the three faces on the side of the mountain are those of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Winky Dink. Not necessarily in that order. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.

Step 2: Consider the hypothesis The hypothesis is that policies like capital-gains and estate-tax cuts are generally geared towards benefiting the rich. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, both discuss the effects of capital-gains and estate-tax cuts on the well-to-do population, but the hypothesis is a broader generalization that policies of that nature are primarily geared towards benefiting the rich. Step 4: Assess the relationship between the premise and hypothesis The premise supports the hypothesis by providing an example of how specific types of tax cuts (capital-gains and estate-tax cuts) will favor the well-to-do in the long run. This indicates that at least some of these types of policies are designed to benefit the wealthier population. Step 5: Evaluate the hypothesis Based on the premise, it is reasonable to consider that the hypothesis could be true. However, it's important to note that the premise only highlights \\"almost any sort\\" of these tax cuts. It leaves the possibility that there might be exceptions or that not all similar policies are geared towards benefiting the rich. While there seems to be a trend, the hypothesis might be a generalized statement and not applicable in all cases. Conclusion:  The premise supports the hypothesis, indicating that capital-gains and estate-tax cuts of almost any sort will favor the well-to-do in the long run. However, the hypothesis might be too generalized and not address every instance.

The second premise is \\"Women are shaving.\\" The context is that some women are currently shaving - it does not specify what they are shaving or where they are. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises We need to analyze if the second premise affects the truth value of the first premise. In other words, does the fact that some women are shaving affect the reality that two men are shaving their faces while a woman watches? Step 3: Determine if the premises are connected The two premises seem to be unrelated as the first premise involves a specific situation with specific individuals, while the second premise is a general statement which involves an unspecified number of women and does not specify what or where they are shaving. Since the second premise does not provide information about the woman who is watching the two men shave, we cannot determine any direct connection between the two premises. Step 4: Determine the truth value of the first premise Given that the second premise does not provide any direct information about the woman in the first premise, we cannot conclude that her actions (watching the men shave) are affected by the fact that some women are shaving. As a result, the truth value of the first premise remains unaltered by the second premise.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A young child is sleeping on a man's coat on the floor.\\" if \\"A kid is sleeping on a coat in the waiting room of the dentist.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the statement, \\"A kid is sleeping on a coat in the waiting room of the dentist,\\" it is possible, but not certain, to conclude that \\"A young child is sleeping on a man's coat on the floor.\\" We can evaluate the similarities and differences between the two statements in order to assess this possibility. 1. Age of the person sleeping on the coat: Both statements describe a young individual as the subject. In the first statement, it is referred to as a \\"young child,\\" while in the second statement, it is referred to as a \\"kid.\\" Although both terms typically describe young individuals, there might be slight variations in their age range. Nonetheless, since the terms overlap in their general age descriptions, this part of the two statements aligns. 2. Location of the person sleeping on the coat: In both statements, the individual is sleeping on a coat. However, the specific location is different. In the first statement, there is no information on the setting, whereas, in the second statement, the location is explicitly mentioned as the waiting room of the dentist. Although the locations differ, it is not impossible for the first statement to occur within a dentist's waiting room. Therefore, the location could align, but it is not explicitly clear. 3. Ownership of the coat: The first statement mentions that the coat is a \\"man's coat,\\" while the second statement does not provide any information about the owner of the coat. It is plausible to think that the coat in the dentist's waiting room could belong to a man, but there is no definite information in the second statement to confirm this. Thus, this part may or may not align based on the given statements. 4. Position of the coat and child: In both statements, it is implied that the coat is on the floor since the child is sleeping on it. This assumption is based on the common understanding that a person would sleep on a coat when it is spread out on the floor rather than on a surface like a chair or table. So, it can be concluded that the coat is on the floor in both situations. In summary, certain aspects of the two statements align well, such as the age of the individual and the coat's position on the floor. Other aspects, like the specific location and ownership of the coat, have more ambiguity due to the lack of explicit information in the statements. While it is indeed possible to conclude that \\"A young child is sleeping on a man's coat on the floor,\\" based on the information given, it is important to keep the uncertainties in mind and not conclude this as an absolute certainty."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hint: If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths.

The answer is:","output":"The term that provides a career description that matches the brothers Louis and Nathan Thompson is \\"pioneering aeronautical engineers and inventors.\\" Louis and Nathan Thompson were distinguished figures in the field of aviation during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, making significant contributions to the development of lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air flight technologies. Born in the 1860s, Louis and Nathan Thompson's interest in flight started at a young age. They began their careers with numerous experiments in building and flying large kites and gliders, which laid the groundwork for their future aeronautical innovations. Their dedication to the principles of aerodynamics and aircraft control systems became evident as they shifted their attention to developing powered aircraft. Their innovative work in this field led to the design and construction of several early aircraft prototypes. The Thompson brothers' contributions to aviation also included developments in airship design. These innovations played a crucial role in the growth of commercial and military aviation during the first half of the 20th century. Some notable accomplishments by the Thompson brothers include: 1. Pioneering the development of ailerons, which are adjustable control surfaces on the wings of airplanes. Ailerons enable lateral (rolling) control of the aircraft, making it possible for pilots to execute turns and bank maneuvers with greater precision. 2. Creating innovative airship designs featuring streamlined, aerodynamic shapes which allowed for increased speed and maneuverability. Their airship models significantly influenced the subsequent designs of blimps and zeppelins. 3. Developing an early wind tunnel, a valuable tool that is now essential for the study of aerodynamics and aircraft design.

To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","output":"To determine which test saw higher concentrations of the products, we should first understand the basics of Le Châtelier's principle and the effect of stress on a chemical system in equilibrium. Le Châtelier's principle states that when a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature, or pressure (i.e., stress), the system will respond by shifting the position of the equilibrium to counteract the change and re-establish the initial equilibrium. This involves either the forward or reverse reaction being favored. Here's a summary of each test: - Test A: No stress - Test B: Stress applied - Test C: Forward reaction observed - Test D: Reverse reaction observed Test A does not provide any useful information since no stress was applied to the system in equilibrium. In test B, stress was applied to the system. This stress caused the system to undergo some change, leading to either the forward or reverse reaction being favored. In test C, the forward reaction was observed, which means the stress applied in test B resulted in an increase in product concentrations. The system adjusted itself by forming more products to counteract the stress and re-establish equilibrium. In test D, the reverse reaction was observed, which means the stress applied led to a decrease in product concentrations. The system adjusted itself by consuming more products and forming more reactants to counteract the stress and re-establish equilibrium. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that test C saw higher concentrations of the products compared to test D, as the forward reaction increased product concentrations, whereas the reverse reaction in test D decreased product concentrations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lyrics: Choose or write lyrics that tell stories or express emotions, usually about everyday life, love, family, nature, and traditional values. 4. Simplicity: Keep the music simple, with fewer instruments playing at the same time. This allows each instrument to shine and create a more intimate atmosphere. 5. Rhythm: Combine steady and simple rhythms with toe-tapping beats. This encourages people to dance along or clap to the music. 6. Dress: Wear clothing that represents a simpler time, like farmers or pioneers. This helps create an authentic folk experience. 7.

[2]. it is not possible to tell. [3]. no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the two sentences contradict each other. Let me explain in detail. Sentence 1: \\"The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of the utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery.\\" This sentence provides information about a photograph of Jane Finn and emphasizes its importance to the police in finding her. It clearly states that the photograph was lost beyond recovery, implying that it cannot be found or retrieved. Sentence 2: \\"The photo was never lost.\\" This sentence directly contradicts the information provided in Sentence 1. It claims that the photo has never been lost, implying that it is still available or accessible. Given the contrasting information in these two sentences, it is clear that the second sentence does not logically follow or is not entailed by the first sentence. The two statements cannot both be true; either the photo was lost beyond recovery or it was never lost. Based on the information we have, we cannot confirm if either sentence is true or false, but we can conclude that they are contradictory and not logically connected. So, the answer would be [3]. No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Input: Inspector Chan Ka-Kui has been demoted to highway patrol as the result of his handling of his previous case (in the first Police Story movie), which involved the violent arrest of crime lord Chu Tao. The new duty pleases his girlfriend, May, who is glad that her boyfriend is no longer taking difficult cases and has more time to see her.However, the happy mood changes when Ka-Kui is greeted by Chu Tao and his bespectacled right-hand man John Ko. It seems Chu Tao is terminally ill with only three months left to live, so he's been released from prison, and while he's still alive he vows to make life difficult for Ka-Kui. John Ko and some henchmen show up at Ka Kui's apartment and intimidate him, baiting the policeman to attack. Later, May and her mother are beaten by John Ko and his men. Ka Kui can no longer hold back, and he lashes out against John Ko and his men at a restaurant.Ashamed of his behavior, Ka-Kui resigns from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. He plans to take a trip to Bali with May, but while he's at a travel agency in a shopping mall, some police officers see him and report that the mall is under a bomb threat. Unable to resist the urge to get involved in police work, Ka Kui tells the officers to sound the fire alarm and have the mall cleared, and agrees to take responsibility for the decision. A bomb does indeed explode, and the entire mall is leveled by the blast.Ka-Kui is praised for his efforts, and he is reinstated and assigned to solve the case of the bombing. Ka-Kui plants a covert listening device in the mall property company's office to try and learn more about the bombers. This leads to a suspect who is a deaf-mute and is a fierce martial artist and explosives expert.The bombing gang, aware that the police are on to them, plan a simultaneous bombing of the property company and the police headquarters. They double their ransom demand to 20 million and kidnap May, luring Ka-Kui into a trap in which he's strapped with an explosive vest and forced to pick up the extortion money from the property company. However, after handing off the money, Ka-Kui is able to drive his car into a tunnel so that the bomb he's wearing can't be activated, and he strips off the vest. He then goes to rescue May, who's being held in a warehouse full of fireworks. Ka-Kui again faces the deaf-mute man, who throws small firebombs at him. Ka-Kui then gains the upper hand and brutally retaliates against the mute man, finally throwing him off a third storey catwalk onto a pile of plastic drums below.Ka-Kui then rescues May and departs the warehouse, just as it explodes in a huge ball of fire.

Question: Percival Lowell established the observatory after what American astronomer that discovered Pluto in 1930? Answer:","output":"Actually, your question seems to have a slight confusion regarding the individuals and timeline involved in the discovery of Pluto. Percival Lowell did establish the Lowell Observatory, however, it was not after but before the discovery of Pluto. His primary goal in setting up the observatory was the study of Mars and his personally held belief that there were canals on Mars, an indication of intelligent life. Quite notably, he also initiated systematic searches for a planet beyond Neptune, often referred to as “Planet X.” It's Clyde W. Tombaugh, an astronomer at Lowell Observatory, who is credited with the discovery of Pluto in 1930. The discovery was made nearly fifteen years post Percival Lowell's death.  Lowell had been driven by a belief that discrepancies in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune could be explained by an unknown ninth planet. Although Pluto turned out not to be the Planet X that Lowell hypothesized, the powerful legacy of Lowell's passionate engagement with astronomy undoubtedly fueled the drive for exploration and discovery at the Lowell Observatory. As for your question, it might be more accurate to rephrase it as follows: \\"Percival Lowell established the observatory which later on employed which American astronomer that discovered Pluto in 1930?\\" And the answer would be: Clyde W. Tombaugh.    In sum, Percival Lowell played a critical role in promoting advanced study of our solar system by establishing the observatory where, years after his death, Clyde W. Tombaugh was able to make the historical discovery of Pluto."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

She let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant. She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father. Forever. The thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle. Stupid? Later someone founds it in the river. Well it's supposed to proof Tarzan is dead. Some cheap drama. The crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that he is gone. She takes their words for granted and want to be taken away(to England). Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is, how hard he is to kill. The caravan is leaving and Jane go along. Again a pothole. She could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more, to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband. She could be smart. She could dive where they found the floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. She can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in Liana's. Picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle Jane.

No. The statement you provided, \\"The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there,\\" is not the correct answer. The Stamp Act Congress was indeed an important gathering of colonial representatives that took place in response to the Stamp Act imposed by the British Parliament in 1765. However, it was not a trial, and its primary focus was on protesting against taxation without representation rather than addressing freedom of the press. The trial that helped establish the right of freedom of the press in Manhattan was the 1735 trial of John Peter Zenger. This historical trial took place in the then-British colony of New York, which would later become Manhattan, New York City. John Peter Zenger was a German-American printer and journalist who operated a newspaper called the New York Weekly Journal. In his newspaper, Zenger published articles that criticized the colonial governor, William Cosby, and accused him of corruption and abuse of power. As a result, Zenger was arrested and charged with libel, which was then considered a criminal offense. During the trial, Zenger's defense attorney, Andrew Hamilton, argued that the accusations published in Zenger's newspaper were factual and that truth should be an absolute defense in libel cases. The jury agreed with Hamilton's argument and acquitted Zenger, establishing the critical precedent that truthful publications criticizing the government should be protected under the principle of freedom of the press. This landmark trial later served as a foundation for the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press among other fundamental rights. The Zenger trial was a crucial turning point that contributed to the development of the free press in America, helping to promote democracy and protect citizens' right to express their opinions and criticisms of public figures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A wild police chase in Washington ended bizarrely when a man crashed a stolen RV into several cars and a home then got out of the vehicle and stripped to his underwear before running into a home and donning female clothing. Snohomish County deputies say 33-year-old James M Johns was spotted driving a motor home that had been reported stolen early Tuesday morning at a Walmart in South Everett. Everett police, Washington State Patrol troopers and Snohomish deputies were all involved in an hour-long chase after repeated attempts to pull Johns over failed. Suspect: James Johns, 33, was arrested after leading police on a wild chase and crashing into cars and homes. Wild chase: The RV was reported stolen Tuesday morning and spotted that afternoon, when a chase involving up to 20 police vehicles ensued. Damage: This car was mangled after Johns hit it with the SUV, setting off a chain reaction of crashes. The. out-of-control driver reportedly swerved into the path of an oncoming. police car, narrowly missing it, and almost hit a jogger and three girls. with a horse. Johns. eventually drove the vehicle to Granite Falls, where it slammed into a. car, which in turn launched another car into the front of Gary Poplin's. home. 'I'm just glad it hit the telephone pole first otherwise I wouldn't have a bedroom,' Poplin told Kiro TV. The. RV didn't stop there. It hit another car and broke through Poplin's. fence before taking out the corner of Juliane Rowell's home and smashing. three more cars. Lucky escape: The driver of one of the vehicles Johns hit was taken to hospital with injuries but police say no one was seriously hurt. Damage: The fence of this home was mowed down by Johns in the RV, and the home was also damaged. Rowell says she was upstairs when the incident happened. 'Then my son started yelling, \\"Mom, Mom, you can't believe this:  someone ran into our house!\\"' she told Kiro TV. After the RV finally came to a stop, witnesses say Johns jumped out and began running, shedding clothing as he went. He ran into a home in his underwear, encountered a group of people inside and demanded they give him clothing to disguise himself from the police. They refused and ran outside before calling the police. Out of control: Johns reportedly hit a car which ran into a telephone pole before hitting Gary Poplin's home. Neighborhood in shock: All in all, five cars and two houses were damaged in Johns's rampage. Deputies were not far away and arrived just moments later. 'He had about 15 or 20 cop cars chasing him,' a witness told KOMO. Deputies removed Johns from the house, reports Kiro TV, where he had managed to don a pair of women's jeans and a women's T-shirt. 'He started putting on girl clothes,' one witness told KOMO. 'And then the cops came and grabbed him and brought him out and he was still wearing the girl clothes.' One motorist was injured in the series of crashes and was taken to hospital. Johns was arrested at the scene.

The Steelers stayed home for a 3-game home stand and for a Sunday Night duel against the Ravens.  The Ravens scored first when Joe Flacco hooked up with Torrey Smith 35-yard TD pass to take a 7-0 lead for the only score of the first quarter.  In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers managed to tie the game up when Ben Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell on a 5-yard TD pass for a 7-7 game.  They eventually took the lead when Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 19-yard TD pass to make it a 14-7 game.  The Ravens came within 4 as Justin Tucker kicked a 46-yard field goal to make it 14-10 game.  However, the Steelers would manage to go ahead by 12 before halftime when Roethlisberger found Markus Wheaton on a 47-yard TD pass followed by a successful 2-point conversion for a 22-10 lead at halftime.  After a scoreless 3rd quarter, the Steelers came out strong and went back to work in the 4th when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 54-yard TD pass making the score 29-10.  The Ravens responded with a big play as Jacoby Jones ran a 108-yard kickoff return for a TD to make it a 29-17 game. Roethlisberger found Bryant again on an 18-yard TD pass to make the score 36-17.  This was followed by the Ravens trying their hand at coming back when Flacco found Crockett Gillmore on a 1-yard TD pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) for a 36-23 score.  But the Steelers were able to seal the game when Roethlisberger found Matt Spaeth on a 33-yard TD pass for a final score of 43-23. A week after passing for a franchise-record six touchdowns against Indianapolis, Roethlisberger duplicated the feat to lead Pittsburgh to its third consecutive win. The 12 touchdown passes over the last two games broke the NFL record of 11 set by Tom Flores for Oakland in the AFL in 1963 and matched by New England's Tom Brady in 2007.

Objective: To prevent your cell phone from ringing during a meeting, Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Both solutions offer their unique perspectives in terms of naive physics reasoning. However, to determine which solution is more sound, we need to first explore the concept of naive physics reasoning. Naive physics reasoning is the understanding and interpretation of the physical world based on common sense and everyday experiences rather than formal scientific knowledge. It is a way of looking at how things work in the real world without being informed by scientific theories. When considering solutions to a problem, naive physics reasoning prioritizes practicality, simplicity, and intuitiveness. Now let us examine the two solutions: 1. Wrapping the phone in a cloth or any sound-absorbing material. 2. Burying the phone in a pile of sand. Solution 1: Wrapping the phone in a cloth or any sound-absorbing material In this solution, the rationale lies in minimizing the sound emitted by the phone by using a material that readily absorbs sound. Materials like cloth, foam, sponge, or paper can be used for this purpose, as they possess the properties to dampen vibrations and muffle the sound. This method is practical and relatively easy to implement for anyone. Moreover, it doesn't require any special resources and can be executed in any environment, even during a meeting. However, this approach may not completely silence the phone; it can only muffle or reduce the loudness to some extent, depending on the sound-absorbing material used. Additionally, there would also be a risk of missing notifications or important calls, as the phone's ringer might be blocked or muffled to the point of being inaudible. Solution 2: Burying the phone in a pile of sand In this solution, the idea is to use sand to block or attenuate the sound emitted by the phone. Sand forms a barrier around the phone, which could impede sound transmission to a significant extent due to the distortion of sound waves. Sand particles may also absorb some of the sound being generated, hence reducing the noise level. By doing so, it might be possible that the phone's ringing could be blocked or significantly muffled. Despite the notion being considered in the realm of naive physics reasoning, this method might not be practical in most scenarios. One of the obvious concerns being the unavailability of a pile of sand in typical meeting environments. Moreover, burying a phone in sand may cause potential damage to the device, risk of dust or sand particles entering the phone, or pose difficulty in retrieving it when needed. Conclusion: Based on the analysis above, it can be concluded that wrapping the phone in a cloth or any sound-absorbing material is a more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. This method is practical, easily implementable, and can be executed in a variety of settings without any major drawbacks. While burying the phone in a pile of sand might offer some naive physics merit, its impracticality and potential risks make it less favorable and less sound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Heavy rains Wednesday afternoon kept emergency officials across Connecticut busy responding to reports of flooding, house fires, washed-out roadways and vehicle incidents.      No major injuries were reported.      Lisa Beaulieu, of Enfield, was driving along Mountain Road in Suffield near Ratley Road about 3 p.m. when a telephone pole adjacent to the road cracked and came tumbling down in front of her car, police said.      \\"She was unable to avoid it,\\" said Suffield Police Chief Richard Brown. \\"The car got tangled up in the telephone wire.\\"      Brown explained that because a tree had fallen on a support wire for the telephone pole, it came crashing down, and the front wheels of the car got tangled in the telephone wire, pulling Beaulieu's car up off the road. With two front tires suspended off the road as her car dangled, Beaulieu, who was in the car with her son, called for help at 3:07 p.m, Brown said.

Within a matter of seconds I saw smoke billowing out,\\" he said. \\"I had to take a second look just to make sure it was real. I ran outside to see it better and sure enough, there were flames.\\"      Macci said he called 911 at 4:31 p.m. and the fire department rushed to the two-story home on 15 Stanford Road, which belongs to Christopher and Rhonda Day.      \\"The neighbor across the street made a quick call,\\" said Manchester Fire Chief Dave Billings. \\"That's what saved these people's house.\\"      With six inches of water rushing down the road, Billings said firefighters had to pull the heavy hose through the water in order to put out the house fire.      \\"There was literally a river running down the street,\\" he said. \\"[The firefighters] were all really tired afterward.\\"      The lightning hit the right rear corner of the roof, \\"blew a big hole in the back of the house\\" and set fire to a second floor bedroom, which was contained by 5:03 p.m., according to Billings. The house was saved and the only damage is in the bedroom, Billings said.      \\"It was fortunate that the neighbor was watching the storm, because it was raining so hard, no one would have seen any indication of the fire until it was much more advanced,\\" he said.      Though the storm was only in town for about 90 minutes, Billings said within that timeframe, while they were also dealing with the house fire, the department received 35 calls for storm-related incidents such as motor vehicle accidents, flooded homes, tree limbs hitting houses, wires going down, and manhole covers blowing up off the street due to the water pressure.      \\"It was a busy day,\\" Billings said. \\"It got crazy for about two hours.\\"      No one was inside the house at the time of the fire, and the Days' black cat named Jack was rescued, according to Macci.      \\"Obviously it was a bad situation but it could've been a lot worse,\\" he said      In Cornwall, one road, Route 125, remained closed Thursday due to the significant amount of damage to the road, according to Kevin Nursick, a spokesperson for the State Department of Transportation. Nursick said the road literally washed away, leaving rubble and exposed patches of dirt along a section of the road in between Route 4 and Dibble Hill Road.      \\"In certain locations when we have heavy rain events, the geography and topography coupled with the soil's inability to absorb water, means the location is conducive to flash-flood effects,\\" Nursick said.      The state Department of Transportation is still assessing the area, Nursick said, but he said it's likely that they'll need to pave the road over again.      \\"Water was traveling over, under and around the road,\\" he said. \\"It's that high velocity water that'll erode everything, including the asphalt.\\"      Conditions like these make it dangerous to drive on flooded roads, Nursick said, and he warned to avoid situations like this when driving in a storm.      Another road that flooded during the storm, according to Cromwell Police Chief Denise Lamontagne was South Street in Cromwell. The section of the road between Main Street and Ranney Street was flooded and closed during the storm, but was able to reopen with no damage afterward, according to Lamontagne.      \\"This is pretty typical when there's a heavy rain in a short time period,\\" she said. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video      SUFFIELD -- A mother from Suffield is thanking the first responders who helped her and her children out of their car after an unusual accident during Wednesday’s storm.      Lisa Beaulieu told FOX61 she was driving home from her mother-in-law’s house with her two young children, ages 4 and 5, when the storm hit abruptly.      “I never anticipated it would get that bad,” she said.      When she reached Mountain Road in Suffield, she said she saw some debris falling from a tree up ahead, which caused a telephone pole to snap toward its top.      “At that point, we were pretty much right underneath it,” said Beaulieu.      She explained, “What we didn’t know at the time was that there was a wire still attached to it.”      Beaulieu said the wire somehow got lodged underneath her car and lifted them into the air. All three of them were OK but trapped.      She called 911 from the car and said the dispatcher stayed with her on the phone the whole time.      Emergency crews from Suffield responded, along with Eversource to make sure that wire wasn’t live. Eventually, they were able to open the doors and carry the children out safely. Then they brought a ladder over to Beaulieu’s side and helped her out that way.      In all, they were in that car balancing on its rear bumper for around 45 minutes.      “I was panicking but I did understand obviously,” she said. “They knew that we were in the car. I knew that we were safe.”      Beaulieu said, “The dispatcher was amazing, the firefighters, everybody that approached us and helped us out made my kids feel very safe. The EMS team that took us out of the scene were so, so good with my kids. They just made us feel so calm and safe, and so that made the situation better.” ||||| A Suffield mother and her children were trapped in a car after it became entangled by electrical wires during a storm.      A Suffield family is grateful to be safe after downed electrical wires snagged their car and hoisted it in the air during the storms on Wednesday.      The driver, Lisa Beaulieu, said she was heading home with her two children in the car when an electrical pole snapped in half as she drove down Mountain Road.      \\"We saw a telephone pole snap and fall down as we were approaching it, our car got stuck in the wires that were attached to it, and we got air lifted,\\" she said.      Beaulieu drove over the power lines which reeled her vehicle into the air. Their car dangled over Mountain Road until rescuers could come free them.      \\"I prayed the entire time we were in the car. I prayed please don't let lightning hit us, please don't let the car shift,\\" Beaulieu said.      The mother waited for help inside the car with her 5-year-old son Drew and her 4-year-old daughter Noella. The mother called 911 and the operator remained on the line until help arrived.      When help did arrive, Drew was the first to see them because he could see out the back window.      \\"I cleaned the window off and started crying for the firefighters,\\" said the 5-year-old boy said.      More than 40 minutes later, the Beaulieu family was free and unharmed. They are thankful for all crews who helped them during their time of need.      \\"Thank you so much,\\" said Beaulieu to the emergency crews.

Hypothesis: \\"No businesses\\" The hypothesis suggests that there are no businesses present. Now, let's evaluate the options provided: 1) Yes This option indicates that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true. However, this is contradictory as the premise talks about the existence of a pub and a restaurant, while the hypothesis claims there are no businesses. If the premise is true, meaning that there indeed are a pub and a restaurant, that would mean that there are at least two businesses present, which contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, this option is incorrect. 2) It is not possible to tell This option suggests that it is unclear if the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. The premise states that there is a pub and a restaurant, which means two businesses exist. Meanwhile, the hypothesis posits that there are zero businesses. Given this contradiction, it is quite clear that the hypothesis is not true if the premise is true, so this option is not correct either. 3) No This option denotes that if the premise (Pub, Restaurant) is true, then the hypothesis (No businesses) is not true. If we accept the premise as true, this implies that the existence of a pub and a restaurant as two functioning businesses is confirmed. In contrast, the hypothesis (No businesses) assumes that there are no businesses, which is in direct contradiction to the premise. Thus, this option is correct.

The university has three campuses, with the main one being located in Graz, and the other two in Kapfenberg and Bad Gleichenberg. All these campuses are situated in the province of Styria, Austria. Based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that FH Joanneum's student and employee population is distributed across these three campuses. It is highly likely that the campus in Kapfenberg, being one of the two additional branches of the university, would have a proportion of the student and employee populations attending there. The exact distribution of students and employees among the three campuses is not provided in the context. However, the hypothesis is reasonable considering that universities usually distribute their resources, programs, and personnel across multiple campuses. This allows them to optimize space allocation and cater to local demands for educational resources more efficiently. Moreover, students and employees may choose to attend a specific campus based on several factors such as the availability of programs, proximity to their residence, or personal preference. Thus, it is likely that students and employees living in or around Kapfenberg would opt to attend this campus, contributing to the mentioned portion in the hypothesis. Furthermore, each campus might have its unique features, facilities, or programs that attract students or employees. The Kapfenberg campus could offer specific courses or research opportunities, contributing to a portion of the university's population choosing to attend there. To conclude, the hypothesis that a portion of FH Joanneum's student and employee populations attend in Kapfenberg, Austria, can be reasonably inferred based on the context provided. While the exact distribution of students and employees is not given, it makes logical sense for the university to allocate its resources, including students and employees, across its different campuses for efficient utilization and better access to the local population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The filming of Crystal Skull involved an extensive chase sequence through the streets of New Haven. Several downtown streets were closed to traffic and received a \\"makeover\\" to look like streets of 1957, when the film is set. 500 locals were cast as extras for the film. In Everybody's Fine (2009), Robert De Niro has a close encounter in what is supposed to be the Denver train station; the scene was filmed in New Haven's Union Station.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Steven Spielberg.  Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Read and understand the question: The question asks to identify which option among Mona Lisa Smile, The Life Before Her Eyes, or Steven Spielberg is not a movie. 2. Analyze the context provided: The context provides information about several movies filmed in New Haven, including Mona Lisa Smile, The Life Before Her Eyes, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It also states that Steven Spielberg directed the Indiana Jones movie. 3. Discard irrelevant information: Information about downtown streets, casting of extras, and filming locations of Everybody's Fine are not directly related to answering the question. Therefore, we can discard it. 4. Use the relevant information to answer the question: Since the context mentions Mona Lisa Smile and The Life Before Her Eyes as movies, and Steven Spielberg as the director of another movie (not being a movie itself), we can conclude that Steven Spielberg is not a movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot: Buzz and Rick are two private investigators running a well-respected detective agency in a small town. They are childhood friends who have spent years solving cases together and have earned a reputation for their attention to detail and relentless pursuit of the truth. One day, they are approached by Linda, a wealthy widow who suspects her late husband's business partner, Jim, might have been involved in his untimely death. According to Linda, her husband, Paul, and Jim had a tense relationship due to disagreements in their business ventures. She presents an anonymous letter she received alleging Jim's involvement in the crime. Buzz and Rick agree to take on the case and quickly immerse themselves in the world of Paul and Jim's business, a once-thriving real estate development company that has fallen on hard times due to a series of failed projects. Through thorough investigation, they uncover a trail of hidden deals, questionable construction practices, and simmering rivalries. As they dig deeper into the case, Buzz and Rick become increasingly uncomfortable with the nature of the evidence they are uncovering. They begin to find subtle hints that suggest a far more sinister third party behind the murder - someone who has orchestrated the crime from behind the scenes, expertly framing Jim and driving the wedge of suspicion between him and Linda. In a dramatic twist, Buzz and Rick discover the anonymous letters sent to Linda were not only designed to implicate Jim but also to subtly provide the detectives with clues hinting at his guilt. The third party wanted Buzz and Rick to unwittingly help with the murder investigation, ensuring the blame falls on Jim. Determined to expose the true mastermind of this complex murder plot, Buzz and Rick use their expertise in deception and manipulation tactics to lure the real killer into a trap. Along the way, they face life-threatening obstacles, emotional turmoil, and even moments of doubt in their long-standing friendship. The climax of the film sees Buzz and Rick confronting the mastermind of the entire scheme – who turns out to be none other than Linda herself. Motivated by greed, she planned and executed her husband's murder to take over their failing business empire and eliminate Paul's increasing debts. Linda planted false evidence pointing to Jim and chose to involve Buzz and Rick in the case, betting on their skills to eventually convict an innocent man. In a tense final standoff, Buzz and Rick manage to overpower Linda, with the truth finally exposed. The duo resolves their internal conflicts while maintaining their unwavering dedication to justice, vowing to continue their work in rooting out deception and standing by the truth. Double-Edged Deception is a gripping crime thriller that examines the depths of human greed and manipulation, serving as a cautionary tale for those who underestimate the bonds of friendship and the power of the truth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: In the team's home opener, former Heisman Trophy winners Johnny Manziel and Marcus Mariota started against each other, and the two combined for over 400 yards with each having a pair of TD's and no INT's. After the Browns led 21-0 at halftime, Anthony Fasano and Dexter McCluster factored in each of the scoring drives for Tennessee, as defensive containment limited Mariota for most of the game. The Titans cut the deficit to 21-14 late in the 4th quarter.  On their next drive, the Browns reached midfield and faced 3rd and 2.  On a broken play, Manziel found Benjamin and threw a touchdown to put the Browns up 28-14.  The Titans reached the red zone on their next drive, but Mariota fumbled and lost the ball, allowing the Browns to run out the clock.  After committing 5 turnovers in their season opener, the Browns had 0 turnovers while forcing 3 Titans turnovers.  For Cleveland, Armonty Bryant led the Browns with 2.5 sacks (of the 7 total) as they pressured the Titans to turn over the ball 3 times, and a selection for AFC Special Teams Player of the Week was bestowed upon WR/KR Travis Benjamin, who had 269 all-purpose yards, including a 78-yard punt return TD. With the win, the Browns ended their six-game losing streak and improved to 1-1 on the season.  Benjamin's 3 TD's were all over 50 yards, becoming only the third player in NFL history to have three 50+ yard touchdowns in the same game. Question: How many touchdowns did Johnny Manziel throw?

Article: Coral Polge is a person who has provided comfort to thousands. She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her.        Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic  artist.        She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died.        Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life.        Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait.        There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.  I am facing a new situation today: It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear.                                                                                                                     Sarah is going to a family picnic in the park and is trying to decide what dress to wear. She knows it is going to be very hot and sunny today and she has narrowed her choices down to two different dresses. One is a dark colored dress and the other is a white dress.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would the white coat absorb more or less sunlight?","output":"Based on the background information provided, we can conclude that darker colors absorb more sunlight than lighter colors. This occurs due to the properties of dark and light colors. Dark colors tend to absorb all wavelengths of light and convert them into heat, hence they get warm when exposed to sunlight. On the other hand, lighter colors, such as white, reflect most of the wavelengths of light, preventing them from absorbing much heat. Applying this to your new situation, Johnathan's black coat would absorb more sunlight and hence more heat than the white coat. So, on a cold winter day, the black coat might be a better choice as it would absorb more sunlight and potentially keep him warmer. Similarly, for Sarah, if she wants to stay cooler in the hot and sunny weather, the white dress would be a better choice. The white dress would reflect most of the sunlight, not letting it convert to heat, and thus helping her stay cooler in the sun. So, to answer your specific question: The white coat would absorb less sunlight than a black or darker colored coat, because white, being a lighter color, tends to reflect more sunlight and thus absorbs less of it."},{"instruction":"The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years.

Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. What land mass are the killer whales nearest?

This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep. Why do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep. Go to bed regularly. Use your bed only to sleep. Don't exercise in the evening. Keep the bedroom dark and quiet. Drink a glass of milk before sleep.

Write some highlights for the following article: Burkina Faso's hopes of reaching the quarter-finals of the African Nations Cup hung by a thread after they could only draw 0-0 against hosts Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday. Burkina, who lost their opening Group A game 2-0 against Gabon, have one point from two matches while Equatorial Guinea have two following their 1-1 draw against Congo. Gabon take on Congo in the group's other game later on Wednesday. Equatorial Guinea's midfielder Randy (right) tussles with Burkina Faso's forward Jonathan Pitroipa. Burkina Faso's defender Steeve Yago (right) flies into a challenge with Emilio Nsue. Bakary Kone (left) climbs above Equatorial Guinea forward Kike to head the ball clear. Burkina Faso failed to convert the game's best chances, hitting the woodwork twice, while Equatorial Guinea relied on counter attacks. Burkina Faso went close in the 20th minute when Alain Traore's whipped 35-yard free kick smashed Felipe Ovono's right post. Equatorial Guinea's Diosdado Mbele was lucky to escape a straight red card in the 28th minute for a dangerous tackle on Jonathan Pitroipa, who was racing towards goal from the left flank. The competition hosts were once again saved by the woodwork in the 39th minute when Ovono deflected Traore's volley from close range onto his post. Referee Neant Alioum shows a yellow card to Burkina Faso's defender Issa Gouo. The lack of goals did not stop the home fans enjoying the Group A match. The Equatorial Guinea keeper was involved again five minutes from the interval, parrying away Bertrand Traore's powerful long-range effort. Equatorial Guinea, however, looked dangerous on the break. Shortly after the hour, Kike's fierce shot was blocked by Burkina keeper Moussa Germain Sanou. Kike, arguably Equatorial Guinea's best player on the day, was substituted eight minutes from time. Highlights:","output":"In a soccer game, Burkina Faso and Equatorial Guinea played against each other for the African Nations Cup. Both teams really wanted to win to get closer to the next part of the competition, called the quarter-finals. But, they ended up with a 0-0 tie, which means nobody scored any goals.

However, it is crucial to consider each option presented and analyze the possibilities. - Medium: This option seems out of context in relation to the question asked. \\"Medium\\" might refer to a level of spiciness, but it does not provide a potential outcome or reaction to eating spicy food. - Illness: In rare cases, eating spicy food might lead to an illness, especially when an individual has hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction to specific spices. However, this is not a common outcome in general for those who eat spicy food. - Throwing up: Consuming extremely spicy food may result in vomiting for some people, particularly if their body cannot handle the intensity of the spice. While this reaction may occur for those unaccustomed to spicy foods, it's not the most common outcome for the average person, who generally develop a certain tolerance to spiciness. - Heartburn: This is the most common outcome when it comes to eating spicy food. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest, often caused by the stomach's acidic contents flowing back into the esophagus. Spicy foods can trigger or exacerbate heartburn, as they may irritate the esophageal lining and increase stomach acid production. Thus, it is common for individuals who consume spicy foods to experience heartburn. - Sleepiness: Sleepiness is typically not a direct outcome of eating spicy food. While one may feel tired after consuming a big, heavy meal, spicy food itself is not commonly associated with inducing sleepiness. In conclusion, heartburn would be the option most in line with common sense as an expected outcome after eating spicy food, as it is a widespread experience among people who consume such dishes. However, it is important to bear in mind that individual reactions may vary and factors such as personal tolerance and sensitivities must be considered."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN)Al Qaeda militants freed six of their fighters from a southern Yemeni prison during an attack on the facility Friday, just one day after the group took over a military camp in the same province, security officials said. These attacks by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has long clashed with Yemen's military, happened in the Arab nation's Shabwa province, more than 100 miles to the east of the capital, which has been in political strife for weeks after minority Houthi rebels took over. Also Friday, at least three more nations announced they were temporarily closing their embassies in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa because of deteriorating security conditions, including neighboring Saudi Arabia. Three of the six militants freed in Friday's prison attack in Shabwa had been sentenced to death, provincial security officials said. Information about casualties, and details about how the attack transpired, weren't immediately available. A day earlier, AQAP took over a military camp at the Sabwa town of Baihan, about 110 miles east of Sanaa, after two hours of clashes with government troops, three local security officials said. This gave AQAP control of all of the camp's weaponry, the officials said. Before the clashes ended, the camp's commander called on tribal fighters to intervene. When those fighters arrived, a ceasefire was called so that the tribal fighters could help evacuate Yemeni troops -- including dozens of injured -- from the camp, a tribal leader said. Saudi Arabia, Germany and Italy said Friday they were suspending their embassy operations in Sanaa -- joining the United States and other nations that made similar moves earlier in the week. Saudi Arabia evacuated its staff because of deteriorating security conditions following a recent takeover of the Yemeni capital by Houthi rebels, the Saudi Foreign Ministry and two Yemeni Foreign Ministry officials said. One of the Yemeni officials said the Saudi evacuations happened Thursday. German Embassy officials left Yemen on Friday morning, Germany's Foreign Ministry said on Twitter. Italy's decision follows \\"recent events in the country and the progressively deteriorating security conditions,\\" a post by Italy's Foreign Ministry reads. The United States, along with Britain and France, said this week that they moved staffers out of their embassies because of instability in Yemen, after Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament and placed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi under house arrest last month. The Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country -- are now the preeminent power in Sanaa. But different groups there have resisted the Houthis' attempted takeover of national government institutions, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement. AQAP, a Sunni Muslim terror group, vowed to attack Houthi loyalists nationwide last year. The United States has had a long relationship with Yemen's leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants. It's not clear what the Houthis' takeover of Sanaa means for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, but the drone program there still appears to be active. A U,S. drone strike killed senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in Shabwa province on January 31. CNN's Alexander Felton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has launched multiple attacks in Yemen's Shabwa province, freeing six of their fighters from a southern Yemeni prison and taking over a military camp after engaging in clashes with government troops.

When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps.  Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.  Rob was in the East Coast for a month. He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions.  Which case would result in more extreme tidal conditions, case A or case B?","output":"Case A would result in more extreme tidal conditions. This is because Case A corresponds to the spring tide, which is characterized by high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. In contrast, Case B corresponds to the neap tide, which results in less extreme tidal conditions.  To understand why spring tides have more extreme tidal conditions, we can consider the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's oceans. Tides are primarily caused by the Moon's gravitational force, which pulls the Earth's ocean waters towards it. However, the Sun's gravitational force also has an effect on the tides, either strengthening or weakening the Moon's influence depending on the relative positions of the Moon, Earth, and Sun.  During a spring tide, the Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned, with the Sun and Moon either both on the same side of the Earth (new moon) or on opposite sides (full moon). In both cases, the gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun combine, resulting in a stronger overall force and hence more pronounced tidal variations. High tides reach higher levels, and low tides fall to lower levels, with stronger tidal currents in between. On the other hand, during a neap tide, the Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other relative to the Earth, as occurs during the first quarter and third quarter lunar phases. In this situation, the solar tidal force partially cancels out the Moon's tidal force, which leads to less extreme tidal conditions. The range between high and low tides is at its minimum, and the tidal currents are generally weaker. Therefore, Rob would observe more extreme tidal conditions in Case A (spring tide) compared to Case B (neap tide), with higher high tides, lower low tides, and stronger currents during the spring tide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vajubhai Vala is the leader of Karnataka. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, several key pieces of information can be extracted: 1. Bhajji - This is likely referring to a person, object, or location linked to the Karnataka region of India. It could be the name of a person or possibly a local food or place, and further context is needed to provide more precise information. 2. Karnataka region - This is a specific region in India, situated in the southwestern part of the country. The capital of Karnataka is Bangalore, which is a well-known technological hub in India. This region is known for its rich history, diverse culture, and numerous tourist attractions. 3. India - The Republic of India is a nation in South Asia, sharing borders with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. It is the world's seventh-largest country by land area and the second-most populous country, with more than 1.3 billion people. India is the largest democracy globally and has diverse cultures, languages, religions, and historical influences from various empires and foreign invasions. 4. Sumitra Mahajan - The sentence incorrectly states that Sumitra Mahajan is the leader of India. Sumitra Mahajan is an Indian politician and previously served as the Speaker of the 16th Lok Sabha (House of the People) from 2014 to 2019. The leader of India is the Prime Minister, as of writing the answer, is Narendra Modi. 5. Indian people - The people of India are referred to as \\"Indian people\\" or \\"Indians.\\" India is known for its cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and religious diversity. It is estimated that there are more than 2,000 ethnic groups in India and over 1,600 languages spoken. The major religions practiced in India are Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism. 6. Vajubhai Vala - The sentence mentions Vajubhai Vala as the leader of Karnataka. Vajubhai Vala served as the Governor of Karnataka from 2014 to 2019, a constitutional head of the state rather than the actual leader. The actual leader of Karnataka, in terms of political power, is the Chief Minister, who, as of writing the answer, is Basavaraj Bommai (July 2021-present). To sum up, the sentence provides information about Bhajji's association with the Karnataka region of India, shares details about the nation and the people of India, and includes two political figures, Sumitra Mahajan and Vajubhai Vala, who held prominent positions during their respective tenures but are not the current leaders in India or Karnataka."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Why does only the vine get left behind after the host tree dies ?","output":"To answer the question of why only the vine gets left behind after the host tree dies, we need to understand the relationship between the vine and the host tree, as well as the properties of both plants. So, let's go through this step by step: Step 1: Identify the relationship The vine and the host tree are engaged in a parasitic relationship. The vine is the parasite, using the host tree for support and resources to grow. As the vine grows, it envelops and wraps itself around the tree, gradually getting stronger. Step 2: Understand the vine's properties Vines are resilient plants that can survive in a variety of conditions. They can quickly adapt to their environment and are often successful at out-competing their host trees for resources such as water, sunlight, and nutrients. This strength and resilience help the vine to persist even after the host tree dies. Step 3: Understand the host tree's properties The host tree provides a stable and supportive structure for the vine to grow on, but it is not as resilient or adaptable as the vine. As the vine consumes more of the tree's resources and puts increasing pressure on its structure, the host tree's health gradually declines. Eventually, the host tree becomes too weak and may succumb to other factors such as disease or pests, leading to its death. Step 4: Analyze the outcome When the host tree dies, it begins to rot and decompose. The decomposition process breaks down the tree's organic material, which may be consumed by other organisms or returned to the soil as nutrients. However, the vine, being a stronger and more resilient plant, is able to withstand these changes and maintain its structure even after the host tree has died and rotted away. Step 5: Provide the answer The vine is left behind after the host tree dies because it is a more resilient and adaptable plant that can withstand the changes associated with decomposition. The vine, having used the host tree as support and resources for growth, can maintain its structure even without the presence of the tree, ultimately leaving only the vine standing as a \\"strange hollow tree-thing.\\""},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Answer:","output":"The correct answer to the question \\"turbines are used to what?\\" with the given context that turbines are used to produce electricity is not \\"direct energy.\\" Instead, a more appropriate and accurate answer would be \\"convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.\\" Turbines are essential components of power generation systems and play a vital role in the conversion of various forms of energy into electricity. Turbines are engineered to produce mechanical energy from different energy sources, such as wind, water, steam, or gas, and they operate by harnessing the kinetic energy from a moving fluid or gas, which causes the turbine blades to rotate. The rotational movement of the turbine blades drives a connected generator, which then produces electricity through electromagnetic induction. In this process, the mechanical energy from the rotating turbine is converted into electrical energy, which can then be distributed and utilized for various purposes. In conclusion, turbines are used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, predominantly for electricity generation.

Article: Placing ads can be an excellent source of revenue for your blog. With “pay per click” (PPC) ads, you get paid when visitors to your blog click on ads that lead to other clients. You usually need to already have a strong readership and high visitor counts for ad buyers to be interested in your blog. Here are some examples of websites that pay you to place ads:  Google’s AdSense program is the most widely used PPC program because it has the power of Google Search behind it. Google will read your article and find \\"ads that are relevant\\" to it and display them next to or within the article. It will also use your readers’ cookies to display ads that are relevant to their recently visited websites on your blog.  You can also sign up for “cost per impressions” (CPM) ads. These function similarly to PPC, but they pay you based on units of “impressions” (views) the ad gets, even if the visitor doesn’t click on the link. Usually, the units are sets of 1,000 impressions.  If you don’t have about 10,000 unique visitors to your site every month, you aren’t likely to make much money from ads. That’s why it’s crucial to build up your readership through marketing and quality content. Affiliate marketing is a very popular way of monetizing a blog because it capitalizes on your readers’ trust of you. If your posts always deliver quality content, then your audience is more likely to trust product or service recommendations. You can provide links or recommendations to relevant products and get a commission from any sales driven by your blog.  Amazon Associates lets you place a banner on your website with products targeted at your audience, such as diapers for a parenting website or art supplies for a creative website. You earn a small commission when people buy something through your link. Amazon pays a commission ranging from 4% to 15%. Amazon is the giant in the industry, but it’s also a good idea to reach out to small companies and even individuals who make products or services that are related to your blog. For example, if you have a popular cooking blog, you might contact small BBQ sauce companies to see if they’d be interested in setting up an affiliate marketing program with you. You earn a portion of the sale through your blog, and they get free marketing.  You can also check out other affiliate programs at big “clearinghouse” sites such as Commission Junction, LinkShare, and ShareASale. These sites offer huge lists of programs, from which you can choose the ones relevant to your blog.  An affiliate aggregator service, such as VigLink, will automatically insert monetized affiliate links into posts for you. They keep a higher percentage of the commission than other services, but the convenience may make up for it. If you already have a high visitor count, you may be able to get other companies to pay you to “sponsor” a post. The advertiser may contact you directly, or you can check out online “sponsorship marketplaces” such as \\"themidgame\\".  Be careful about sponsors who want you to place an article to increase their own page rank. This violates Google’s policy and could hurt your AdSense revenue.  You can also check out websites such as Blogsvertise, Social Spark, and Review Me for listings of paid or sponsored posts.  Don’t allow sponsored posts to overtake your own content. Remember: your readers visit your blog to read your content. Make sure that you only post sponsored posts that still benefit your readers in some way. You don’t want your blog to seem like a corporate shill. Working directly with a company to help with a promotional campaign can be a good way to boost traffic and revenue for your blog. Many companies, particularly ones like publishers, are happy to pay you to participate in things like Twitter parties, blog-based “book tours,” and giveaways.  For example, if you run a popular blog where you review romance novels, contact various romance publishers to see if they’re interested in paying you for a review or other promotional event, like an author interview. Signing up with third-party connecting agencies can be helpful. Blog Friendly PR, Blog Insiders, and Brandfluential are popular networks. This type of revenue comes from providing sales “leads” to other companies who partner with your blog. You don’t actually have to sell a product or service to generate these leads -- you just need your blog visitors to provide their information and opt in to being contacted by your partner. For example, if you run a popular DIY blog, you could partner with a home supply store. If your visitors agree to be contacted by the home supply store, you could get paid by the company for generating that “lead.” You may be able to use your blog to create freelance income by using it to showcase your work. Don’t use your blog only to sell products, but having a “portfolio” section on your blog can let readers see what you’re good at.  For example, if you run a photography blog, keep a portfolio of your very best photographs and market yourself as a freelance photographer. Readers will know exactly what they’re getting because they can see your passion and expertise. Blogs can also be very helpful even if you have a full-time “day job,” such as an attorney. For example, writing blog posts that offer helpful law advice and information will demonstrate to readers that you know your field. It will also give a sense of who you are personally, which is very important to prospective clients. Once you have a loyal following and have demonstrated your trustworthiness, you can consider adding “paid content” to your blog. For example, you could host a special podcast or write an e-book and charge visitors a small fee to access it.  Paid courses, consulting services, and advice are other popular types of products and services you can use the reputation you’ve established to sell.  You can also use a service such as Zazzle or CafePress to create branded items like t-shirts and tote bags for sale. The Bloggess creates new items weekly, usually playing on a humorous post from the week before. Consider memberships, where you charge a small monthly fee for users to gain access to exclusive content, video content, or possibly direct access to you through Q&A or live events. WordPress has many plugins to help you add membership services to your blog. Consider “bonus content.” For example, if you run a podcast on your blog, you might consider having the standard episode available for free but a longer version or additional content for a small fee. Dan Savage’s extremely popular “Savage Lovecast” runs on this model, where standard episodes are free and “magnum episodes” (longer, with no ads) are available for a subscription fee.  Many bloggers parlay their blog’s success into books. The “Cake Wrecks” blog has several popular books of disastrous cake photos, and The Bloggess now has two books about her life adventures. The “Tom + Lorenzo” bloggers wrote a tongue-in-cheek “how to guide” to becoming a celebrity.  Remember: anything you can offer that’s valuable to your readers might be worth them paying for. Just don’t let your blog become so paid-content-heavy that it doesn’t seem like a good value to your audience anymore.

Robert Willett rwillett@newsobserver.com ||||| A North Carolina lawmaker was taking flak Thursday for posting on Facebook that President Lincoln was \\"tyrant\\" just like Adolf Hitler.      State Rep. Larry Pittman made the comparison while responding to critics Wednesday who were blasting him for pushing a bill that would have restored North Carolina’s ban on same-sex marriage in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court.      Larry Pittman attends a House session on Jan. 30, 2013. Takaaki Iwabu / The News & Observer via AP file      It was a commenter’s crack that he should “get over it” that set off Pittman, who is a Republican, a preacher — and apparently still smarting over the South’s loss in the Civil War more than a century-and-a-half ago.      “And if Hitler had won, should the world just get over it? Lincoln was the same sort (of) tyrant, and personally responsible for the deaths of over 800,000 Americans in a war that was unnecessary and unconstitutional,” Pittman wrote.      (The death toll was closer to 620,000, according to the Civil War Trust.)      The exchange on Pittman’s campaign Facebook page first appeared in a story by the Raleigh News & Observer.      And while it appears to have been scrubbed from Pittman’s page Thursday there were still plenty of people piling on and calling him a “warm pile of garbage” and worse.      Larry Pittman comments on his campaign facebook page. Courtesy The News & Observer      Pittman, who is from the Charlotte suburb of Concord, did not return calls for comment to both his office and home and did not respond to an email. Neither did House Speaker Tim Moore, who is also a Republican.      The Facebook fracas came after Moore on Wednesday effectively killed Pittman’s bill, which says the Supreme Court ruling in 2015 that legalized gay marriage \\"is null and void in the State of North Carolina.”      “There are strong constitutional concerns with this legislation given that the U.S. Supreme Court has firmly ruled on the issue, therefore House Bill 780 will be referred to the House Rules Committee and will not be heard,” Moore said in a statement.      Pittman made his Hitler crack a day after White House spokesman Sean Spicer had to apologize for saying the Nazi leader \\"didn't even sink to using chemical weapons\\" against his own people like Syrian strongman Bashar Al-Assad.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Answer based on context: The Black Sea Fleet is considered to have been founded by Prince Potemkin on May 13, 1783, together with its principal base, the city of Sevastopol. Formerly commanded by such legendary admirals as Dmitriy Senyavin and Pavel Nakhimov, it is a fleet of enormous historical and political importance for Russia. In 1790, Russian naval forces under the command of Admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait. From 1841 onward, the fleet was confined to the Black Sea by the London Straits Convention. As a result of the Crimean War, one provision of the Treaty of Paris was that the Black Sea was to be a demilitarized zone like the Island of Åland in the Baltic Sea, although Russia subsequently renounced the treaty and reconstituted its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea. The crew of the battleship Potemkin revolted in 1905 soon after the Navy's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. Lenin wrote that the Potemkin uprising had had a huge importance in terms of being the first attempt at creating the nucleus of a revolutionary army. During World War I, there were a number of encounters between the Russian and Ottoman navies in the Black Sea. The Ottomans initially had the advantage due to their having under their command the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben, but after the two modern Russian dreadnoughts Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya had been built in Mykolaiv, the Russians took command of the sea until the Russian government collapsed in November 1917. German submarines of the Constantinople Flotilla and Turkish light forces would continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the war's end. How many years after  the founding of the Black Sea Fleet did the Battle of Kerch Straigt occur?","output":"To determine how many years after the founding of the Black Sea Fleet the Battle of Kerch Strait occurred, follow these steps: 1.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who does Briony think the housekeeper's son is attacking?  In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \\"sex maniac\\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie apologises for the obscene letter, but Cecilia surprises him and confesses her secret love for him. They then proceed to make passionate love in the library when Briony walks in, and thinks that Cecilia is under attack. Cecilia and Robbie try to pass the incident off. A:","output":"In the 1935 England setting, Briony Tallis, a 13-year-old from a wealthy family, witnesses an intimate moment between her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner. Briony misunderstands the situation and comes to the conclusion that Robbie is attacking Cecilia. This misinterpretation is further fueled by Briony reading an explicit letter Robbie accidentally gives her to deliver to Cecilia, which contains crude language and expressions of his sexual desire for Cecilia. Briony shares the content of the letter with her cousin Lola, who labels Robbie as a \\"sex maniac.\\" Later on, Briony walks in on Cecilia and Robbie making passionate love in the library, further solidifying her misguided belief that Robbie is attacking Cecilia.

Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did.  Which town caused less fertilizer to dissolve in the soil?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"The town that caused less fertilizer to dissolve in the soil is Silver town. As mentioned in the scenario above, Silver town produced their food sustainably and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides. Therefore, there would be no fertilizer for the rain to dissolve, preventing any runoff carrying it away. This contrast to Gold town, which did use fertilizers and would have experienced rain dissolving some of it into the soil and potentially being carried away into water bodies.  This difference is crucial as the dissolved fertilizer, rich in nitrogen, can lead to algae blooms when it reaches bodies of water. Extensive algae growth can create a \\"dead zone\\" where nothing can grow due to insufficient oxygen resulting from the decomposition of the algae. In other words, Silver town, by not using fertilizers, effectively reduced the risk of contributing to harmful environmental impacts, such as algae blooms and the creation of \\"dead zones\\" in bodies of water, while Gold town may have contributed to these issues by their use of fertilizers."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   42.1 Circulatory systems link exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body.   Q: What organ systems link exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body?   Choices:  - vascular  - pulmonary  - nervous  - circulatory  A: Answer:","output":"The organ system that links exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body is the circulatory system. The circulatory system is a complex network of organs and structures that work together to transport nutrients, oxygen, and waste products to and from the cells of the body. This vital system helps maintain the overall stability of the body's internal environment, while also facilitating communication between various organs and systems. Let's examine each of the given choices to provide further clarification: 1. Vascular System: This term refers to the network of blood vessels, such as arteries, veins, and capillaries, which are essential components of the circulatory system. These vessels transport blood throughout the body, providing the necessary link between cells and exchange surfaces. As a component of the circulatory system, the vascular system supports the overall function by carrying necessary materials to cells and removing waste materials from them. 2. Pulmonary System: This system refers to the structures involved in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the ambient air and the bloodstream, primarily the lungs and associated airways. Although the pulmonary system is crucial for respiration and closely interacts with the circulatory system, it does not, by itself, link exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body. 3. Nervous System: The nervous system coordinates and controls various body functions by transmitting electrical signals between the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Although the nervous system is essential in maintaining overall body function and communication between organs, it does not directly link exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body, as its primary role is in transmitting information and coordinating responses. 4. Circulatory System: As mentioned earlier, the circulatory system acts as the primary organ system for linking exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body. Comprising the heart, blood vessels (vascular system), and blood, this system efficiently transports nutrients, oxygen, hormones, and other essential substances to cells, while also removing waste products and carbon dioxide for disposal through other systems such as the pulmonary and excretory systems. Thus, the correct answer is the circulatory system, as it is the main organ system responsible for linking exchange surfaces with cells in the body, ensuring they receive the necessary nutrients and oxygen while also removing waste products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The First French Empire, was the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte of France and the dominant power in much of continental Europe at the beginning of the 19th century. Its name was a misnomer, as France already had colonies overseas and was short lived compared to the Colonial Empire.  - Charles Percier ( ( al psje ) ; 22 August 1764 -- 5 September 1838 ) was a neoclassical French architect , interior decorator and designer , who worked in a close partnership with Pierre François Léonard Fontaine , originally his friend from student days . For work undertaken from 1794 onward , trying to ascribe conceptions or details to one or other of them is fruitless ; it is impossible to disentangle their cooperative efforts in this fashion . Together , Percier and Fontaine were inventors and major proponents of the rich , grand , consciously - archaeological versions of neoclassicism we recognise as Directoire style and Empire style . Following Charles Percier 's death in 1838 , Fontaine designed a tomb in their characteristic style in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery . Percier and Fontaine had lived together as well as being colleagues . Fontaine married late in life and after his death in 1853 his body was placed in the same tomb according to his wishes .  - The Empire style, , the second phase of Romanticism, is an early-nineteenth-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts that flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the Consulate and the First French Empire periods, although its life span lasted until the late 1820s (or more in some countries). From France it spread into much of Europe and the United States.     After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'charles percier' exhibits the relationship of 'country of citizenship'. Find the answer from the choices below.  Choices: - france  - french empire Answer:","output":"Charles Percier exhibits the relationship of 'country of citizenship' with France. Although he was an influential figure during the First French Empire and played a significant role in the development of the Empire style, Charles Percier's country of citizenship was France. The First French Empire was a political entity, whereas citizenship is generally associated with a country. Moreover, the First French Empire was a part of French history, and those who lived during that time would still hold French citizenship.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are related, but they are indeed asking about different aspects of tears and their functions in the human body. Let me offer a detailed answer for each question separately to provide clarity. Question 1: Why do you shed tears when you're tired? When you're tired, your body experiences a range of physiological changes that may lead to the release of tears. Here are a few possible explanations: 1. Eye strain: When you're fatigued, your eyes may be working harder to maintain focus, especially if you've been staring at a screen or concentrating on a task for an extended period. This prolonged effort can cause eye strain, which could lead to the production of tears as a natural lubricant to alleviate ocular discomfort. 2. Blink rate: Your blink rate decreases as you become more tired, which may result in reduced lubrication of the eyes by tears. The eyes may then become dry, prompting your tear glands to produce more tears to rehydrate the ocular surface. 3. Emotional response: Tiredness can increase your emotional sensitivity, making you more susceptible to emotional triggers like sadness, frustration, or stress. In response to these emotional stimuli, your body may produce tears as a regulatory mechanism to help restore emotional balance. Question 2: Why do we have tears in our eyes? Tears serve multiple functions in maintaining eye health and overall wellbeing: 1. Lubrication: Tears help keep your eyes lubricated by maintaining a thin film of moisture known as the tear film, which coats the surface of your eyes. By maintaining adequate lubrication, tears help reduce friction between the eyelids and the ocular surface, ensuring that blinking remains comfortable and the eyes don't feel dry and irritated. 2. Nourishment: The tear film also contains essential nutrients, electrolytes, proteins, and other components necessary for maintaining the health and integrity of the cornea, the outermost transparent layer of the eye. By providing nourishment to the corneal cells, tears play a critical role in supporting optimal visual function. 3. Protection: Tears serve as a protective barrier against irritants, debris, and pathogens. They contain lysozymes, enzymes with antimicrobial properties, that help neutralize bacteria and other potential infections. 4. Clearing and cleaning: Blinking helps spread tears evenly across the eye's surface, ensuring that debris and irritants are washed away. This helps to clean the eyes continuously and maintain a clearer vision. 5. Emotional expression: Tears also serve as an outlet for emotional release, helping individuals cope with various feelings, such as sadness, joy, or frustration. The act of crying can have a soothing or cathartic effect on one's emotional state. In summary, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 focuses on the reasons behind tear production when we are tired, while Question 2 asks about the overall functions of tears in our eyes and their significance to our ocular health and emotional wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sam Benjamin Harris (born April 9, 1967) is an American author, philosopher, neuroscientist, blogger, and podcast host. He is a critic of religion and proponent of the liberty to criticize religion. He is concerned with matters that touch on spirituality, morality, neuroscience, free will, and terrorism. He is described as one of the \\"Four Horsemen of atheism\\", with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett. Harris considers Islam to be \\"especially belligerent and inimical to the norms of civil discourse,\\" relative to other world religions. He asserts that the \\"dogmatic commitment to using violence to defend one's faith, both from within and without\\" to varying degrees, is a central Islamic doctrine that is found in few other religions to the same degree, and that \\"this difference has consequences in the real world.\\"  In 2006, after the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Harris wrote, \\"The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' is a dangerous fantasy--and it is now a particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It is not at all clear how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer. It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. But it is important to recognize why this is so--it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms.\\" He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam.  Harris wrote a response to controversy over his criticism of Islam, which also aired on a debate hosted by The Huffington Post on whether critics of Islam are unfairly labeled as bigots:  Is it really true that the sins for which I hold Islam accountable are \\"committed at least to an equal extent by many other groups, especially [my] own\\"? ... The freedom to poke fun at Mormonism is guaranteed [not by the First Amendment but] by the fact that Mormons do not dispatch assassins to silence their critics or summon murderous hordes in response to satire. ... Can any reader of this page imagine the staging of a similar play [to The Book of Mormon] about Islam in the United States, or anywhere else, in the year 2013? ... At this moment in history, there is only one religion that systematically stifles free expression with credible threats of violence. The truth is, we have already lost our First Amendment rights with respect to Islam--and because they brand any observation of this fact a symptom of Islamophobia, Muslim apologists like Greenwald are largely to blame.  Harris has criticized common usage of the term \\"Islamophobia\\". \\"My criticism of Islam is a criticism of beliefs and their consequences,\\" he wrote following a controversial clash with Ben Affleck in October 2014 on the show Real Time with Bill Maher, \\"but my fellow liberals reflexively view it as an expression of intolerance toward people.\\" During an email exchange with Glenn Greenwald, a critic of the New Atheists, Harris argued that \\"Islamophobia is a term of propaganda designed to protect Islam from the forces of secularism by conflating all criticism of it with racism and xenophobia. And it is doing its job, because people like you have been taken in by it.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what else does he think about it?","output":"Based on the provided information, Sam Harris believes that \\"Islamophobia\\" is a term designed to protect Islam from criticism and secularism by conflating all criticism of the religion with racism and xenophobia.

Researchers at Arizona State University and University of Illinois at Chicago looked at 6,716 fast-food outlets nationwide to check the extent of indoor and outdoor marketing aimed at youngsters. Marketing towards children ranged from free toys to ads featuring sports celebrities and cartoon characters, as well as play areas and promotions for kids' birthday parties. Fast-food restaurants in the United States are 'disproportionately' targeting black children and kids in middle-income and rural areas, according to a newly published study. 'Majority black communities, rural areas and middle-income communities are disproportionately exposed (to child-directed marketing) and specifically to indoor displays of kids' meal toys, a popular strategy among chain restaurants,' the study said. 'In light of these findings, it is important to urge the fast-food industry to limit children’s exposure to marketing that promotes consumption of unhealthy food choices.' The enduring popularity of fast food is widely seen as contributing to an obesity crisis in the United States, where one in three adults are considered obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In February, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported a 43 per cent fall in obesity rates among children aged two to five -- raising hopes that obesity might be on the wane.","output":"A new study found that fast-food restaurants in the United States are focusing their marketing towards black children and kids in middle-income and rural areas.

This statement indicates that people who supported Mulroney were looking for a change from Trudeau's leadership.  It is also important to note that Mulroney was an opponent of Trudeau, which further strengthens the argument that those who supported Mulroney were interested in a different direction for the country.

Emotion The history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example Schadenfreude, are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules. It is thus historically variable and open to change. Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain, Sweden and Australia.

There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University. Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails. 1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break. 2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration. 3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging. 4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid. 5. Kidney and liver problems can create \\"half-and-half nails\\", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick. Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Options: A: Doctors can tell us something about our health by looking at our nails. B: We should see a doctor if we find nails in bad condition. C: A famous doctor in the USA conducted an interesting research. D: If we don't want to get ill, we need to clean and stop biting our fingernails. Answer:","output":"A: Doctors can tell us something about our health by looking at our nails."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Blood Monkey Context: Blood Monkey is a horror / jungle suspense thriller set in modern day Thailand. The film centers around anthropological professor Conrad Hamilton (F. Murray Abraham) attempting to study a new species of primate, possibly the missing link between humanity and the great ape, found in a hidden valley deep within the jungles of Thailand. The movie opens into action with Hamilton's initial research team trying to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fails and is apparently wiped out. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne (Prapimporn Karnchanda) survive and scour the camp site looking for clues and remains of their team. Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a motley crew of incredibly naive college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming \\"bad things\\" are in there and won't go any further. He high-tails it back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace. Chenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and learn of his mission and their purpose...sort of. Hamilton professes of dream findings in a uncharted region of the jungle and their potential for career-launching documentation. He has Chenne confiscate their mobile phones and hands out information bracelets for each member, which contain all of their emergency contact info, and promptly leads the slightly unwilling team to the valley entrance.

В Любви нет места планам и банковским счетам. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The provided Russian sentence \\"В Любви нет места планам и банковским счетам\\" translates to \\"In Love, there is no room for plans and bank accounts\\" in English. In this sentence, the speaker seems to express a perspective towards love, hinting at the idea that love is an emotion that transcends practical or material considerations such as plans and bank accounts.  This may vary based on cultural interpretation, but it invokes the timeless debate of love versus practicality or materialism. The plans could symbolize the future ambitions, strategic thinking and the need for control and predictability of life. On the other hand, the bank accounts in this context, can symbolize financial stability, wealth and material well-being.  Through the phrase \\"no room for plans and bank accounts\\", the speaker emphasizes that love is a feeling, a bond shared between two people, that is unaffected by such worldly considerations. It suggests that true love does not require any strategic plans or materialistic possessions, rather it cherishes the innate emotional connection and shared understanding between the individuals. When translated to several other cultures and languages, its essence remains the same: love is about emotion and connection rather than strategic planning or material wealth. This sentence eloquently captures this essence and reminds us of the power and simplicity of love. However, interpretations can vary and it is always good to understand an idiom or phrase within its context to capture its full meaning and nuance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: \\"Why do only rich kids get good schools?\\" I was the founder and director of a part-time out-of-school college preparatory program. The questioner was a parent; herself a victim of a dulled urban education. The statement was more of an indictment than question, and I had no answer. \\"Well, why can't this program be a school,\\" she offered. The program sent 100 percent of our graduates to college. We served poor students who were the first generation in their families to attend college. We provided college preparation through a six-week summer program, after-school tutoring and in-school academic advising. That single mother's question came at the end of the summer program. This was always a tough time. As the kids said goodbye to their friends and the program's high expectations, we all looked at the school year with great trepidation. We knew that the students were returning to failed schools with very low expectations -- and results to match. Like that mom, I too wondered why wealth and whiteness are too often linked to quality education. Her question connected to a discussion that I'd been having with some colleagues during the summer program. All of the teachers in that program worked in failed urban schools. Many had tried to reform traditional urban schools. They'd started formal and informal programs, identified groups of kids and connected to parents. Each had had some success with some kids, but the conditions that led to the need to do something went unchanged. The question was raised at the end of our 2002 summer program. My first instinct was to begin down the path of opening an all-male minority charter school. In Connecticut, charter schools are publicly funded and privately run, with no teachers' unions, no school board influence and no centralized curriculum. These were the pluses. There was only one minus: There was no money. The charter idea was dead as soon as it began. I assembled an all -black team. My plan was to put black educators together, and we would show 'em. Brothers and sisters were gonna open a successful charter school. Black educators serving black kids. This was my first major mistake. Talent and commitment have no color. Kids don't care what color their teachers are, and I shouldn't have either. After almost a year of stops and starts with a team that was not effectively assembled, I realized that I failed in my judgment because I did not keep my eye on the goal, which was to build a school that sent kids to college regardless of their hue or economic status. I have never made that mistake again. I doubled back and went into the schools and found the teachers who stayed the latest and arrived the earliest. I looked for the most ambitious teachers who had a reputation of being the most talented, and we started a second team. I am a social worker. I knew that I could run an organization, but wasn't sure about developing curriculum. When I created Team 2, my first pick was the best teacher I could find. Rich Beganski is the perfect complement, or opposite, of who I am. He's meticulous and lives and breathes curriculum. He is an operations genius. He was a longtime assistant coach who never wanted to be coach. I've never been an assistant and don't want to be one. Our team was composed of a white guy, a Latina, a black woman and a black man bound by a single commitment: to send kids to college. In 2003-04, Connecticut was settling a desegregation case. A component of the agreement was to open eight magnet schools in Hartford in two years. Magnet schools are publicly funded and publicly run theme-based schools, complete with unions and subordinate to the local school board. The part-time college preparatory program was hosted in a community college. The college's president was an impulsive visionary. On a Friday afternoon elevator ride from the 10th to the seventh floor, he said, \\"Steve, we're gonna start a high school, you should run it.\\" I told him I would and got off on the seventh floor. First thing that following Monday, I was in his office with the dead charter school application. Over the next few months, we tweaked it until it became a magnet application. With the help of some of the program's parents, we submitted it to Hartford's mayor, superintendent, and then the board. The process was anything but smooth. The district could not conceptualize what Capital Prep would become. A year-round college-preparatory uniform school for grades six to 12 was the absolute antithesis of the district's offerings. Hartford was either the worst or second-worst school system in Connecticut, with a high dropout rate and three failed traditional high schools. At first, Capital Prep was a poorly received idea. It became real, in large part, because of the state's settlement and our team's determination to answer the question. After receiving school board and state approval in December 2004, we were expected to open for August 2005. The problem was that while we had a \\"team,\\" Capital Prep didn't have a single employee. Since we were becoming Hartford Board of Education employees, we all had to apply for our jobs. My hire was relatively painless. Beganski, the team's operations genius, was turned away as an \\"internal\\" candidate. After two years of working 30 hours a week to turn an idea into a reality, he became our first central office/union casualty. I promised to resign if he wasn't hired. Finally, the district relented and gave him the job that he had designed. This was to become an ongoing theme in the school's first few years: ridiculous actions focused on maintaining the failed status quo. We worked through the summer with the rest of the team. The district stumbled and stalled until, with less than two weeks before our first day of school, Capital Prep only had two staff members: Beganski and me. We were not allowed to hire a single teacher. Even though we had had a team that had worked for years researching and designing the school for no money, we were told that none of them could be hired because union rules dictated who and when we could hire. This meant that our last employee for year one was hired 14 hours before the first day of school. In the years that have followed, the struggles with the union and central office's narrow, regressive policies have tested our commitment to answer that mother's simple question. The complexity of the answer is rooted in Capital Prep's relationship to the failed policies of the once highly centralized district and educators' union. In recent years, a new superintendent has come on board -- the third in our first three years. His approach has been absolutely aligned with what we need to exist. He leaves us alone as long as we get results. He can't shield us from the unions, but he has supported our creativity and commitment to our kids. He lets me run the school, and our teachers teach what works. That's all we've ever sought. Answering the question of \\"why only the rich kids get good schools\\" has set our team on an odyssey. Seven years later, we have an answer that we are proud of. Rich kids are not the only kids who have good schools, because Capital Prep's 80 percent black/Latino, 60 percent poor students attend one of America's top high schools, according to US News & World Report. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Perry.","output":"In this article, the journey of creating Capital Prep, a high-performing magnet school, is detailed.

With 80% black/Latino and 60% low-income students, Capital Prep has been recognized as one of America's top high schools by US News & World Report.

He forgives his wife and takes her to a movie.\\" He is generous enough to forgive her, and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier. At this point in time, however, we still haven't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge, and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film Mr. and Mrs. Beetle are attending. Suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of Mr. Beetle's disloyalty, and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella, before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper. In the final scene, both Mr. and Mrs. Beetle, now somewhat more appreciative of each other, are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when Mr. Beetle sought his final revenge. We do, indeed, hope that \\"the home life of the Beetles will be less exciting in the future\\" This film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect species, but Starewicz is communicating so much more than that. This isn't a story about beetles  it is a story about us. And it's startlingly accurate, isn't it?!","output":"The sentiment of this text is (2) positive.

He had recently suffered defeat in Wales, there were agricultural problems leading to a famine, and relations with the pope were worsening. Discontent amongst England's magnates led Henry to promise reform, but under continued pressure his authority disintegrated. A royal council of fifteen magnates was formed in June that year, and the rule of the country transferred from the king to the council. With foreign help Henry's reign was restored in 1261 as the council were reluctant to start a civil war. Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, raised a rebellion. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to the king and the baronial forces led by de Montfort.Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, held the castle in support of Henry. John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was the garrison's co-commander. A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army attacked from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down, although it is unclear why. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London with the intention of attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18 April, Good Friday. The method used is uncertain, although it involved a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water. In a co-ordinated attack that had been pre-arranged, the armies of de Montfort and de Clare attacked the city. They entered Rochester in the evening and that night the cathedral was raided. The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. Because the next day was Easter..., what would be the answer ?","output":"The name of the king whose loyalists engaged in a civil war with the baronial forces in 1264 is King Henry III."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea and its neighbors in the region reacted with caution to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision Thursday to cancel the U.S.- North Korea nuclear summit. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement released by the North’s central news agency (KCNA) that his country remains open to resolving problems with the United States “whenever and however,” and offered praise for President Trump’s diplomatic engagement efforts. “We had held in high regards President Trump’s efforts, unprecedented by any other president, to create a historic North Korea-U.S. summit,” said the vice foreign minister in a statement released Friday by KCNA. The conciliatory tone that came from Vice Foreign Minister Kim stands in sharp contrast to earlier criticisms, insults and threats made by another North Korean official that prompted Trump to cancel the June summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Thursday North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui called U.S. Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” and threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the U.S. over comments made by Pence calling for North Korea to follow the Libya denuclearization model. The Libya model refers to the rapid and complete dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program in 2003 and 2004, before the easing of any sanctions. But North Korea is acutely aware that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by his own people a few years later, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the United States. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until its undefined security demands are met. Trump blamed the “tremendous anger and open hostility” from Pyongyang for forcing the cancelation of the summit, but many analysts say the issue was more about substance over tone and the unbridgeable gap between the two denuclearization positions. But... What is the U.S. trying to obtain from North Korea? - an end to any diplomatic effort - a nuclear showdown - denuclearization - not enough information Answer:","output":"The U.S. aims to achieve denuclearization of North Korea in its diplomatic efforts. The cancelation of the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit by President Donald Trump was seen as a response to hostile statements from North Korean officials. However, many analysts believe that the core issue lies in the differing perspectives on denuclearization between the two nations. The United States has pushed for a swift and complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program, similar to the Libya denuclearization model. This model involved the rapid and full dismantlement of Libya's nuclear program before lifting any sanctions. However, North Korea seeks a more incremental approach that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and delays complete denuclearization until its undefined security demands are met. Despite the cancelation of the summit, North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan expressed openness to resolving problems with the United States and appreciated President Trump's efforts towards arranging a historic North Korea-U.S. summit. The U.S. ultimately seeks denuclearization of North Korea to reduce the potential threat posed by its nuclear weapons and to promote stability in the region. Additionally, the U.S. wants to address the concerns of its allies and partners in the region and advance global non-proliferation efforts. Negotiations and diplomatic approaches to this goal seem to be the favored method, rather than instigating a nuclear showdown or ending all diplomatic efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. a good answer to this question?","output":"Though the provided information gives a historical context for the development and promotion of solar technology, it does not specifically address the incentive programs that have been implemented over the years to promote solar technology. A more detailed and comprehensive answer would include the names of various incentive programs and initiatives designed to support solar technology deployment and utilization. Here is an improved response: Solar technology has been greatly promoted over the years through a variety of incentive programs worldwide. These programs aim to make solar energy more accessible and affordable by providing financial support, reducing costs, and simplifying the adoption process. Some of the well-known solar incentive programs include: 1. Feed-in Tariffs (FIT): These programs offer long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, like solar power, at a fixed rate or guaranteed price per kilowatt-hour (kWh). These tariffs have been successful in promoting solar power, particularly in countries like Germany, Spain, and Australia. 2. Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) / Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): The RPS policy mandates utility companies to generate a specified percentage of their total energy from renewable sources such as solar power. Utilities often meet this requirement by purchasing RECs, which are tradeable certificates representing one megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy generated. In the United States, states like California and Massachusetts have RPS policies that have spurred significant solar energy development. 3. Net Metering: This incentive allows solar energy system owners to send excess energy produced by their system back to the grid, offsetting their electricity consumption. Net metering policies can be found in countries like the United States, Canada, and several European nations, offering an effective means to support the adoption of solar technology. 4. Investment Tax Credit (ITC): In the United States, the ITC offers a federal tax credit for both residential and commercial customers who install solar energy systems. The ITC allows these customers to reduce their tax liability by a percentage of the cost of their installed solar system, thereby financially incentivizing solar adoption. 5. Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs): Used mainly in the United States, SRECs are a type of REC specifically tied to solar energy generation. Utilities required to generate a certain percentage of solar power can purchase SRECs to meet their targets, providing a financial incentive for solar energy system owners. 6. Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit (RRETC): This tax credit in the United States applies to homeowners who install solar energy systems in their homes, helping to reduce the overall costs of residential solar installations. 7. Government Grants and Rebates: Many governments worldwide offer grants, rebates, or subsidies to promote solar energy installations. These financial incentives can help potential solar customers overcome the initial costs of installation and make solar energy more accessible. These are just a few examples of the numerous incentive programs and policies designed to promote solar technology around the world. The growing interest in sustainable and alternative energy sources has only highlighted the importance of these incentives to drive solar energy adoption and proliferation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here are the steps to accomplish this goal: 1. Choose the right pitcher: Select a pitcher with a wide enough opening that can accommodate the broom handle. Make sure the pitcher is sturdy and has a stable base to ensure it won't topple over when the broom is inserted. 2. Clean and prepare the pitcher: If you are re-purposing an old pitcher, clean it thoroughly to remove any residues or dirt. If the pitcher has any damage or cracks, it may not be suitable for holding a broom. 3. Position the pitcher: Place the pitcher in a convenient location where you can easily access the broom. This could be in a corner, near a closet, or beside a cleaning supply cabinet. 4. Insert the broom: Put the broom handle into the pitcher, making sure that it sits snugly and securely. The broom bristles should rest on the floor, and the handle should be standing upright in the pitcher. 5. Ensure stability: Make sure that the broom handle is not too heavy for the pitcher. If the pitcher seems unstable, you might need to find a larger pitcher or look for a different method for storing the broom. Option B: Using a pitcher to hold a ruler A pitcher might not be the first storage option you'd think of for a ruler, but it can be an effective and creative way to store one or more rulers. Here's how to achieve this: 1. Choose the right pitcher: Select a pitcher that is tall and wide enough to accommodate the length and width of the ruler(s). Ideally, you want a pitcher with a sturdy base to provide stability when holding the ruler(s). 2. Clean and prepare the pitcher: Clean the pitcher thoroughly to remove any residues or dirt. Ensure there are no cracks or damage that might affect its ability to hold the ruler(s) securely. 3. Position the pitcher: Place the pitcher in a convenient location, such as on a desk, a bookshelf, or near a drafting table, where you can easily access the ruler(s). 4. Insert the ruler(s): Stand the ruler(s) upright inside the pitcher, with the base resting at the bottom. Make sure the ruler(s) are secure and do not lean against the side of the pitcher, as this might cause it to become unstable. 5. Arrange the ruler(s): If you are storing multiple rulers in the pitcher, arrange them so that they are evenly distributed inside the pitcher, without overcrowding it. This will make it easier to access individual rulers and help with overall stability. By following these steps for either option A or option B, you can accomplish the goal of repurposing a pitcher as a holder for a broom or ruler.

Iowa had become the 29th state in the Union on December 28, 1846, and the state continued to attract many settlers, both native and foreign-born. Only the extreme northwestern part of the state remained a frontier area. With the development in the 1850s of the Illinois Central and the Chicago and North Western Railway, Iowa's fertile fields were linked with Eastern supply depots as the Civil War began.

The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick  and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million.

Pacific War By mid-1942, the Japanese found themselves holding a vast area from the Indian Ocean to the Central Pacific, even though they lacked the resources to defend or sustain it. Moreover, Combined Fleet doctrine was inadequate to execute the proposed \\"barrier\\" defence. Instead, Japan decided on additional attacks in both the south and central Pacific. While she had the element of surprise at Pearl Harbor, Allied codebreakers had now turned the tables. They discovered an attack was planned against Port Moresby; if it fell, Japan would control the seas to the north and west of Australia and could isolate the country. The carrier USS Lexington under Admiral Fletcher joined USS Yorktown and an American-Australian task force to stop the Japanese advance. The resulting Battle of the Coral Sea, fought in May 1942, was the first naval battle in which ships involved never sighted each other and only aircraft were used to attack opposing forces. Although Lexington was sunk and Yorktown seriously damaged, the Japanese lost the carrier Shōhō, and suffered extensive damage to Shōkaku and heavy losses to the air wing of Zuikaku, both of which missed the operation against Midway the following month. Although Allied losses were heavier than Japanese, the attack on Port Moresby was thwarted and the Japanese invasion force turned back, a strategic victory for the Allies. The Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia. Moreover, Japan lacked the capacity to replace losses in ships, planes and trained pilots.

Answer based on context: The Dutch garrison of Recife was increased in March 1640 by 2,500 soldiers carried aboard 28 ships under Amidrals Cornelis Jol and Jan Lichthart, who was in charge of naval operations to disrupt the Portuguese sugar trade. In December Portugal revolted against the Spanish Habsburg rule, proclaiming the seventh Duke of Bragança as King João IV in place of Philip IV of Spain. Although the Dutch welcomed the news of the revolt, expecting the Portuguese to become their allies, this did not happen, as the Dutch had no wish to restore the occupied territories to Portugal. Recife served as base for an expedition under Jol and Lichthart, in 1641, to seize Portugal's slaving depots in Angola before any treaty could be concluded in Europe, and despite a ten-year truce between both countries that was signed on 12 June, the hostilities continued, resulting in the expulsion of the Dutch from Brazil in 1654. How many years was the truce supposed to last?","output":"The truce between the two countries was supposed to last for 10 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: -  Sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse - The plants and floor absorb the the sunlight - The absorbed sunlight is converted to heat - The heat cannot escape the glass - The heat is trapped in the greenhouse - The hot air rises - The colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involves the continuous circulation of air within the greenhouse, maintaining an optimal temperature for plant growth. As the hot air rises and the colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom, this creates a convection current that circulates the air in the greenhouse. As the colder air reaches the bottom, it gradually absorbs heat from the radiating surfaces (such as the plants and the floor) and warms up. In addition to this natural circulation, greenhouses typically employ strategically placed vents and automated systems like exhaust fans, heaters, or air circulation fans to further regulate the temperature and humidity levels. These systems help prevent the formation of hotspots or excessively humid or dry areas, which could negatively impact plant growth. Through this constant circulation of air, along with the heat-trapping nature of the glass, the greenhouse is able to maintain a consistently warmer and more stable environment as compared to the outside conditions. This elevated temperature and humidity within the greenhouse create a microclimate that fosters the growth of a wide variety of plant species, including those that may not naturally thrive under the local outdoor conditions. Moreover, the continuous circulation of air also benefits the plants by enhancing pollination and dispersal of essential plant nutrients. The movement of air helps to distribute carbon dioxide evenly throughout the greenhouse, ensuring that all plants have access to the required amount of this vital compound for their growth through photosynthesis. In summary, the last step of the process in a greenhouse is the continuous circulation of air, coupled with the regulation of temperature and humidity, to create an optimal growing environment for various plant species. This fosters enhanced growth, better yield, and the successful cultivation of plants that may not typically thrive in the local outdoor climate conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This version remains pretty faithful to Dahl's original story so one can't lay the blame on John Hambley's script. If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice-overs. One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy, vibrant, fun-filled movie..... instead, the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch. Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children's' classic. Young orphan Sophie (voice of Amanda Root) lives in a none-too-friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of Mrs Clonkers. One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street. The figure realises it has been seen, so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night. Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country, and fears that he will eat her. But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG (voice of David Jason). The BFG refuses to eat people, instead restricting himself to foul-tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers. However, Giant Country is populated by numerous other giants who DO feast - every night, as it happens - on poor unsuspecting humans. Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants. Together they go to the Queen of England (voice of Angela Thorne) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man-eating giants. The Queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else. Jason voices the BFG quite well (one of the few pluses in the film) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality. The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired, with very little to bring the characters to life. Similarly, the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated - Sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed (and look almost indistinguishable from each other). Even the places are uninventive; Giant Country especially comes up short, being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons. At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy, yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences. Little of Dahl's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily. One chapter in the book deals with the BFG's love of \\"whizzpopping\\" (farting) and is laugh-out-loud hilarious. In the film, the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling. I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what I got was pretty much the opposite!

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt. Throughout the march De Long had written up his journal each day, but after October 20 his entries became intermittent, largely limited to terse statements of the dying and the dead. He noted the...

M. Barrie . Barrie publicly identified him as the source of the name for the title character in his famous play Peter Pan , or The Boy Who Would n't Grow Up . This public identification as \`\` the original Peter Pan '' plagued Davies throughout his life , which ended in suicide . He was the first cousin of the English writer Daphne du Maurier . He was awarded the Military Cross after serving as an officer in World War I , and in 1926 founded the publishing house Peter Davies Ltd.  - Mary Anne Clarke (born Mary Anne Thompson; 3 April 1776  21 June 1852) was the mistress of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Their relationship began in 1803, while he was Commander-in-Chief of the army. Later in 1809, she wrote her memoirs which were published. She was the subject of a portrait by Adam Buck, and a caricature by Isaac Cruikshank; ten days after the latter's publication, the Duke resigned from his post as Commander of the British Army. In 1811, she commissioned Irish sculptor Lawrence Gahagan to sculpt a marble bust of her; this is now housed in the National Portrait Gallery, London.  - Sylvia Jocelyn Llewelyn Davies (25 November 1866  27 August 1910), \\"née\\" Sylvia du Maurier, was the mother of the boys who were the inspiration for the stories of Peter Pan by J.

Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law's 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \\"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\\" said Davis. \\"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\\" \\"This award means a great deal to me,\\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\\" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state. She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school's Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school's Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she's found her niche. \\"I've always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it. The issues I've dealt with through the years have been on the side of helping people maintain the basics of life - home, healt h care, jobs and family.\\" She says her desire to serve others was sparked early, growing up in a single-parent home, aware that her widowed mother faced certain challenges as she supported her four children through public school and college.

Gosudarstvennyj gimn Rossijskoj Federacii, IPA: [ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪnɨj ˈɡʲimn rɐˈsʲijskəj fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨj])  is the name of the official national anthem of Russia. It uses the same music as the \\"State Anthem of the Soviet Union\\", composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov, who had collaborated with Gabriel El-Registan on the original anthem.  From 1944, that earliest version replaced \\"The Internationale\\", as a new, more Soviet-centric, and Russia-centric Soviet anthem.  The same melody, but without lyrics mentioning dead Stalin by name, was used after 1956. A second version of the lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977, placing less emphasis on World War II and more on the victory of communism. The Russian SFSR was the only constituent republic of the Soviet Union without its own regional anthem. The lyric-free \\"Patrioticheskaya Pesnya\\", composed by Mikhail Glinka, was officially adopted in 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia and confirmed in 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, by the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. This anthem proved to be unpopular with the Russian public and with many politicians and public figures, because of its tune and lack of lyrics, and consequently its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions. The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem, but none of the entries were adopted. Glinka's anthem was replaced soon after Yeltsin's successor as President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, first took office on 7 May 2000.

The music was spinning more and more slowly, life was coming at him faster and faster, and he was trying to sort through it all. He was processing the slow death of Definitive Jux: brainchild of rapper El-P, and the creative petri dish for left-of-center acts like Cannibal Ox, Aesop Rock, RJD2 — and Lif himself, who’d carved out his identity with a flurry of politically charged albums, including 2002’s acclaimed, definitive “I, Phantom” and 2006’s “Mo Mega,” that saw him labeled as a protest rapper. “Being on a label that I loved for years, there’s a part of Def Jux that I just chose to remember more than the other part,” Lif said, looking back during a recent interview. “The way down — no one wanted to see it go like that. We all weren’t hanging out as much, and you could just get a sense that, OK, this isn’t what it used to be.” He’d learned painful lessons releasing “I Heard It Today” independently, without the Def Jux machine behind him. “I’m not a label,” he said. “I learned that very quickly.” And his studio was all but destroyed when the basement in his Dedham home flooded. “It rained for three days straight,” he said. “I didn’t think anything of it, and my studio drowned.” With so many things swirling, Lif wondered where he was going. After a seven-year gap, the Boston rapper comes back strong with “Don’t Look Down,” a new album that shows his incisive lyricism and conceptual approach. “I was like, I don’t know if I could make a good record right now,” he said. “That’s why I had to walk away.” He also wondered where life was taking him. He’d dabbled in real estate, but the housing crisis ruined the investment. He looked at career paths outside of music, started an NFL podcast, and looked into classes at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting. Meanwhile, his father was dealing with health issues, and a close friend died of juvenile diabetes. “No one can escape life without having these man-in-the-mirror moments,” he said. “You have to look at the predicament you’re in and be like, yo, I have to examine what role I played in how I got here.” Lif cut the signature dreadlocks he’d been growing since he first started rapping with a group of friends who called themselves the Sons of Zion. His run as a rapper, he was becoming convinced, was over. Then in December 2009, the phone rang. His friend and photographer Dom Savini was in Washington, D.C., for work. One night he stopped in a bar and crossed paths with Eric Hilton of Thievery Corporation. Savini threw out the idea that Thievery Corporation should work with Lif. That the idea somehow made it out of the bar still amazes Lif. “I was like, what?” he said. “You told him they should do a jam with me, and then he actually called me?” That call led to a February 2010 session and a song, “Culture of Fear.” It took another nine months for Lif to learn where that would lead. He went six months without hearing from Hilton, and eventually e-mailed him. “He told me not to worry about it,” Lif reported. Three months later, Hilton eventually called. ”Culture of Fear” would be the title track of Thievery Corporation’s 2011 LP. He had just one instruction, Lif related: “‘Come to D.C. and rehearse, because we’re going on tour.’ ” That venture, which saw Lif playing everywhere from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado to Australia’s Splendour in the Grass festival, was the rapper’s turning point. “Touring with them revitalized me,” he said. It also jogged his memory: The connection he’d built with Thievery Corporation felt like the bond he had at Def Jux. In 2013, Lif started to grow out his dreads and reassembled his studio. Last summer he linked with a pair of Oakland artists, the Polish Ambassador and Ayla Nereo, releasing the breezy collaborative project “Terra Bella.” Last fall he signed with a buzzy new indie label, Mello Music Group, which reissued “I, Phantom,” on vinyl with the intent of re-introducing Lif to the rap world. “It does feel like I’m back,” Lif said. “It feels like I’m me again. It just feels like the MC is back.” His first solo album in seven years, “Don’t Look Down,” arrived on April 15. But with the lingering pall of police brutality and the ceaseless din of Donald Trump seemingly ripe for his critical lens, Lif took a step back and made a project that’s just as piercing, but more inwardly oriented. “It was necessary, man,” Lif said. “It was really an act of self-preservation, it really was. That’s the thing: I’m tuned in now, but I’m almost kind of glad that that didn’t show up as much on this album. I know that that’s become my trademark, the sociopolitical commentary; that’s why I’m glad that this album doesn’t really do that.” It’s the first page in what Lif considers his second chapter. “I don’t know that I’ve been this inspired,” he said. “I’m just amped to start offering music to people again and touring the world and building that thing back up, because it means even more to me now. After seeing the other side, where I’ve been to the brink of not even being in this, I know how valuable it is. So it’s precious to me.” At Middle East Upstairs, May 5 at 10:30 p.m. Tickets: 15, advance 13. 617-864-3278, www.mideastclub.com Write a title for it.","output":"Boston Rapper Mr. Lif's Triumphant Return: Finding Inspiration and Reinvention in \\"Don't Look Down\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… How did the casting director react to the actress who originated the role after the play opened?

You must generate significant words which are not the stop words. Problem:Sentence1: Active immunity results when an immune response to a pathogen produces memory cells.  Sentence2: Pathogens are germs that cause disease. Solution:","output":"To find a significant overlapping word between the two sentences, I'll go step-by-step: Firstly, I am going to analyze Sentence 1: \\"Active immunity results when an immune response to a pathogen produces memory cells.\\" Secondly, I'll analyze Sentence 2: \\"Pathogens are germs that cause disease.\\" Now that we have the two sentences, the next step is to determine the significant or meaningful words in them.  In Sentence 1, the significant words can be 'Active', 'immunity', 'immune', 'response', 'pathogen', 'produces', 'memory', 'cells'.  In Sentence 2, the significant words can be 'Pathogens', 'germs', 'cause', 'disease'. The third step is to compare the significant words in both sentences, to identify overlap. In this case, the overlapping word in both sentences is 'pathogen'. Keep in mind that, although the instructions allowed for variations of words (like 'survival' and 'survive') to count as overlapping words, in this scenario, we have an exact match. Therefore, the solution to the problem is 'pathogen'.  This process allowed us to exclude non-significant or stop words such as 'the', 'an', 'and', 'to', which might appear in many sentences but don't play a major role in determining the key subject or action."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security... Who cancelled a summit with North Korea because of the hostility coming from North Korea over denuclearization demands? - Clinton - not enough information - Trump - Obama","output":"President Donald Trump canceled the summit with North Korea due to the hostility coming from North Korea over denuclearization demands."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Trio of New Games Victimized by Piracy (AP) AP - A month before the video game's scheduled release this coming Tuesday, illegal copies of the hot sci-fi action title \\"Halo 2\\" were already circulating on the Internet. It's had a lot of company lately. Multi-choice problem: What is this text about? Choose from:  A). World.  B). Sports.  C). Business.  D). Science/Tech.","output":"This text is about: D). Science/Tech. The passage discusses the issue of video game piracy, specifically mentioning the sci-fi action title \\"Halo 2\\". The article reveals that illegal copies of the game were available on the Internet even before its scheduled release. Video game piracy is a significant concern in the field of technology, as it impacts developers, publishers, and the overall gaming industry. Piracy not only causes financial losses for the creators and distributors of video games, but it also has serious consequences for legitimate consumers who purchase games. When piracy is prevalent, it becomes more difficult for game developers and publishers to invest in advanced technologies, produce new titles, and improve gaming experiences. As a result, the gaming industry and its consumers suffer from a lack of innovation and the potential for gaming advancements. The increased circulation of illegal copies of games, as mentioned in the passage, highlights the shortcomings in the existing copyright protection systems in place. While many companies have implemented anti-piracy measures, such as digital rights management (DRM) systems, these methods often fall short of completely curbing piracy. Moreover, technological advancements, such as high-speed Internet connections and peer-to-peer sharing platforms, have facilitated the distribution of pirated games. Piracy has consequently become a significant challenge for the gaming industry, spurring a need for improved strategies to protect digital content. In addition to legal and technological solutions, consumer behavior and education play a vital role in addressing video game piracy. By informing consumers about the negative impacts of piracy on the gaming industry and urging them to support legitimate sources, the prevalence of piracy may be reduced. In conclusion, the passage focuses on the area of Science/Tech, delving into the challenges posed by video game piracy in the technology sector and shedding light on potential solutions to address the issue. The text emphasizes the repercussions of piracy for game developers, publishers, and consumers, as well as the importance of developing effective anti-piracy strategies and encouraging responsible consumer behavior."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the sentiment of the following movie (choose your answer from the options) review sentence? coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro  Possible answers: (a). negative (b). positive The answer is:","output":"(b). positive The sentiment of the given movie review sentence can be identified as positive due to the following reasons: 1. The phrase \\"incongruous but chemically perfect teaming\\" implies that although the combination of the two actors (Crystal and De Niro) might initially seem odd or unlikely, their partnership works exceptionally well on screen. The use of the word \\"perfect\\" highlights the success of this pairing, contributing to a positive sentiment. 2. The mention of well-known and respected actors - Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro - further boosts the positive sentiment, as their presence is likely to be associated with a certain level of quality and appeal. Including both their names in the review indicates that the reviewer perceives their teamwork as a strong aspect of the movie. 3. The sentence structure is another clue to the positive sentiment. The use of the phrase \\"as before\\" suggests that this successful teaming has been observed in previous projects, which can be seen as a positive point for both the actors and the movie itself. It also showcases the consistency of their strong performances. In summary, by analyzing the words and phrases used in the movie review sentence, as well as the sentence structure and references to the actors, it is clear that the sentiment is positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kennedy, will make a personal appearance before a California parole board for the first time in at least nine years on Wednesday, supported by two psychologists' reports saying he no longer poses a threat to society, his attorney said. And in what a prosecutor and Sirhan's attorney say will be an extraordinary appearance, one of the surviving shooting victims in the 1968 assassination, retired TV journalist William Weisel, is expected to tell the parole panel that he won't object to Sirhan's release if the board OKs it, Weisel told CNN.

In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. Can we infer the following? The minority achievement gap will definitely go away in the 21st century.","output":"Based on the given statement, it is difficult to definitively conclude that the minority achievement gap will entirely disappear in the 21st century. However, we can analyze the statement further to infer the speaker's intent and outlook on the issue. The speaker emphasizes the importance of reading as a new civil right, which suggests a need to address any barriers that may prevent individuals from accessing education and gaining essential skills. As the speaker mentions the progress in closing the \\"minority achievement gap now,\\" it conveys a belief that some improvements are being made in this area. However, a definitive statement about the complete closure of the minority achievement gap during the 21st century cannot be made based solely on this comment. There are a number of considerations and factors that require attention in overcoming inequalities in education: 1. Systemic changes: Addressing the minority achievement gap will require fundamental changes throughout the entire educational system. This means reevaluating curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment methods, as well as access to resources, such as technology and books. 2. Policy and funding: Policymakers must ensure that there is adequate funding and resources allocated to the schools and communities with higher concentrations of minority populations. This includes funding for facilities, teachers, staff, and supplemental programs. 3. Community involvement: Strong community involvement is crucial in supporting initiatives aimed at closing the achievement gap. Community organizations, parents, and local leaders can work together to demand accountability from schools and educational institutions and support students' educational goals. 4. Culturally responsive education: Teachers and educational institutions need to adopt culturally responsive approaches that account for the diverse backgrounds of the student population. This includes acknowledging the unique experiences and histories of minority populations and incorporating these perspectives into the teaching process. 5. Early intervention: Efforts to address the minority achievement gap should begin as early as possible in a student's education, providing them with the necessary support and resources to succeed from the very beginning. 6. Addressing inequalities outside of education: The achievement gap is linked to a range of societal factors, such as economic disparities, access to healthcare, and quality housing. Addressing these external factors will also contribute to reducing the achievement gap between minority and non-minority populations. In conclusion, while the speaker's statement reflects a positive outlook on recent progress and the importance of education in preparing people for the 21st-century workforce, it does not guarantee the complete closure of the minority achievement gap. To make such a definitive statement, a more comprehensive analysis of the progress being made in addressing the aforementioned factors is necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Stefanie Graf was born on 14 June 1969, in Mannheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, West Germany, to Heidi Schalk and Peter Graf (18 June 1938 - 30 November 2013), a car and insurance salesman. When she was nine years old her family moved to the neighbouring town of Bruhl. She has a younger brother Michael. Graf was introduced to tennis by her father, an aspiring tennis coach, who taught his three-year-old daughter how to swing a wooden racket in the family's living room. In late 1999 and early 2000, as part of her Farewell Tour, Graf played a series of exhibition matches against former rivals in New Zealand, Japan, Spain, Germany and South Africa. She played Jelena Dokic in Christchurch, New Zealand, Amanda Coetzer in Durban, South Africa, and her former rival Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Zaragoza, Spain. It was Graf and Sanchez Vicario's first head-to-head meeting since 1996. In February 2000, Graf played against Kimiko Date at Nagoya Rainbow Hall in Tokyo, winning in three sets. In September 2004, Graf dispatched her former doubles partner Gabriela Sabatini in straight sets, in an exhibition match played in Berlin, Germany. She was also in Berlin to host a charity gala, as well as inaugurating a tennis stadium renamed the \\"Steffi Graf Stadion\\". Proceeds from her match against Sabatini went to Graf's foundation, \\"Children for Tomorrow\\".  In July 2005, Graf competed in one tie of World Team Tennis (WTT) on the Houston Wranglers team. She was beaten in two out of three matches, with each match being one set. Graf lost her singles match to Elena Likhovtseva 5-4. She teamed with Ansley Cargill in women's doubles against Anna Kournikova and Likhovtseva but lost 5-2. She was successful, however, in the mixed doubles match. Graf completely ruled out a return to professional tennis. In October, Graf defeated Sabatini in an exhibition match in Mannheim, Germany, winning both of their sets. Like the exhibition match the previous year against Sabatini, proceeds went to \\"Children for Tomorrow\\".  In 2008 Graf lost an exhibition match against Kimiko Date at Ariake Colosseum in Tokyo. As part of the event, billed as \\"Dream Match 2008\\", she defeated Martina Navratilova in a one-set affair 8-7, with Graf winning a tiebreaker 10-5. It was the first time in 14 years Graf had played Navratilova. Graf played a singles exhibition match against Kim Clijsters and a mixed doubles exhibition alongside husband Andre Agassi against Tim Henman and Clijsters as part of a test event and celebration for the newly installed roof over Wimbledon's Centre Court in 2009. She lost a lengthy one-set singles match to Clijsters and also the mixed doubles.  In 2010, Graf participated in the WTT Smash Hits exhibition in Washington, D.C. to support the Elton John AIDS Foundation. She and Agassi, her husband, were on Team Elton John, which competed against Team Billie Jean King. Graf played in the celebrity doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles before straining her left calf muscle and being replaced by Anna Kournikova.

Answer:","output":"Quinn, the author of the book about the zoo visit for Carson, is likely to experience several outcomes as a result of writing and publishing the book. While it's difficult to predict the exact trajectory of Quinn's life and career, we can make educated guesses based on common experiences of authors and the potential reception of the book. Here are a few possibilities for what might happen to Quinn: 1. Positive reception and increased recognition: If Quinn's book about the zoo visit is well-received by readers and critics alike, Quinn's reputation as an author and storyteller may grow. This could lead to more opportunities for them to get their work published or to collaborate with other writers and illustrators. 2. Opportunities for sequels or related projects: Depending on the popularity and success of the zoo visit book, Quinn may be inspired to write sequels or create related projects based on the characters, setting, or themes of the original story. This could potentially develop into a series or even a children's franchise, expanding Quinn's reach and influence in the literary world. 3. Public speaking and events: As an author, Quinn might be invited to participate in events such as book signings, readings, and speaking engagements. These events not only help promote their book but also allow them to connect with their audience and network with other writers, illustrators, and industry professionals. 4. Financial rewards: Though financial success is never guaranteed in the publishing industry, a popular and well-received book has the potential to generate income for Quinn. This can come in the form of book sales, royalties, and opportunities for merchandising or adaptation rights. 5. Personal satisfaction and fulfillment: Writing a book is no easy feat, and completing one can provide a sense of achievement and pride for anyone, Quinn included.

In an Old Berlin Post Office, a Gallery Flourishes C/O Berlin winkingly acknowledges its location in the Postfuhramt — or (roughly) post office — in its name (“c/o” being postal lingo for “care of”). The space (Oranienburger Strasse 35/36; 49-30-28-09-19-25; www.co-berlin.info) has not been renovated since the days when it was filled with letter carriers. But today, it is filled with communiqués of a different sort: photographs, including, in a current exhibition titled “On Street,” up through Jan. 9, the work of the fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh. “We try to make the tracks and traces visible, so there’s a historic dimension in the space, to mix it up with contemporary photography. It’s not a White Cube situation,” said the curator Felix Hoffmann, referring to the famed contemporary art galleries. “It’s very Berlin-ish.” The more symbolic aspect of the “care of” reference — in the sense of commitment to supporting the arts — is very much intentional. Mr. Hoffmann noted that 10 years ago “there was a very big Magnum retrospective and not one space in Berlin was interested in the show.” C/O was thus founded to rectify Berlin’s undervaluing of art photography. A decade later, the scene has since caught up — though C/O remains at the epicenter, having shown the likes of Robert Frank and Nan Goldin. The pieces by Mr. Lindbergh include black-and-white portraits of supermodels in industrial spaces and grand shots of film sets. The globetrotting photographer’s own artistic roots began in Berlin in the ’60s. He apprenticed to learn how to decorate department store windows, before going on to be a photographer’s assistant and build his reputation. It’s the pseudo-street photography of some of Mr. Lindbergh’s work that inspired the name of the exhibition, for its sense of movement and improvisation. “You cannot figure out if this is a real photo shoot or not,” Mr. Hoffmann said. “It looks like he grabbed five cameras and took the model downtown in New York, with no team, to use the street as a stage.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a gallery called C/O Berlin, which is located in an old post office building. The gallery is known for displaying photographs and is currently exhibiting works by the fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh. The curator of the gallery, Felix Hoffmann, says that the space is special because of its history and connection to contemporary photography. The gallery was created to support Berlin's art photography scene after many other places were not showing important photographic works."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They convey different information about different aspects regarding the number of cases in China. Let's analyze each sentence separately to understand the differences: 1. The total number of new cases in China was fewer than 100 for the third day in a row. This sentence tells us that the total number of new cases being reported in China during a specific three-day period is less than 100 each day. This information gives us an insight into how the situation is developing during that period, indicating that the increase in new cases is relatively low for three consecutive days. 2. On Monday, the number of SARS cases in China passed 5,000, hitting a total of 5,013. This sentence informs us that on a specific Monday, the cumulative number of SARS cases in China surpassed the 5,000-mark, reaching 5,013 cases in total. This information highlights a milestone in the overall number of cases in China but does not provide any detail about the number of new cases on that day or any consecutive days. This information could be helpful to understand the overall scale and progress of the situation. In summary, the two sentences convey different meanings. The first sentence focuses on a steady decline, low number, or controlling of daily new cases during three consecutive days, while the second sentence emphasises on a specific day (a Monday) when the overall SARS cases surpassed a significant milestone (5,000 cases). These sentences might be part of a larger context or report discussing the progress and overall impact of the cases in China, but they do not have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The South African public broadcaster has been warned not to report on calls for Jacob Zuma to step down as president, according to campaign groups. A spokesman from the country's Right2Know group said the interference 'makes a mockery of the principle of freedom of expression'. The claim, which is denied by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, was reported by Right2Know and fellow campaign group SOS Coalition. SABC has been told not to broadcast calls for Jacob Zuma to stand down as South Africa president. According to News24, SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said: ‘There was no such instruction. People just interpreted things their own way. [Journalists] were told not to punt one side of the story to balance it.’ He added: ‘They spent a long time one side of the story without calling to get views from the other side.’ Right2Know's Mark Weinberg claimed the groups had learned about the instruction through the Broadcast, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers’ Union. SABC was reportedly told not to broadcast people booing Mr Zuma at Nelson Mandela's memorial service. He said members of the union were given the instructions on Friday. It was also reported earlier this month that broadcasts showing of booing of President Zuma at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service had been banned. According to City Press, the crowd booed his face every time it showed up on a big screen at the service. Highlights:","output":"1.

Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.

Question: Who is the assistant to Dr. Michell Herman? Title: Moby Dick Movie plot: The film begins in November 20, 1969, 50 miles off Soviet waters. When the USS Acushnet dives under the ice, a young Ahab listens for enemy subs when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists in the presence of an emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine as Ahab hears a roar. The sub is brought to the icy surface, and the target identifies itself as a gigantic, white, whale-like creature. Ahab survives, but loses his leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the sub back underwater. In the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman (RenÃ©e O'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) test a whale song generator when the USS Pequod surfaces behind them and Lieutenant Commander Starbuck (Adam Grimes), the executive officer, persuades them to come aboard. In the sub, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale. Although Michelle explains that the whale song generator needs a recorded whale vocalization, Captain Ahab (Barry Bostwick) comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of Moby Dick back in 1969. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy sub with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice. In San Diego, Captain Boomer (another survivor of the attack of '69) is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the Pequod. He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How much money does Dante reveal stole from his brother's bike fund? 50 A:","output":"Title: The 50 Cycle Chase Plot: 1. Setting: Our story is set in the bustling city of San Francisco, where two brothers, Dante and Liam, share a small apartment. They come from a humble background, but their dreams are big, especially Liam's dream of entering the National Cycling Championship. Step 1 Justification: Strong plots often involve personal dreams or goals. Setting a clear goal (Liam's need for a professional bike) can drive the story forward and motivate character actions. 2. Initial Situation: Dante, older of the two, is a small-time conman, while Liam is a bicycle courier with a passion for cycling. They barely make ends meet but Liam has been steadily saving money for a championship-grade racing bicycle. Step 2 Justification: By setting up the initial situation, we demonstrate the brothers' personalities, ambitions, and the origins of the tension between them. 3. Trigger: Dante stumbles upon an opportunity for a big heist that can change their lives; only problem, he needs 50 for the initial investment. In desperation, he takes 50 from Liam's bike fund expecting to replace it soon. Step 3 Justification: A trigger or main event sparks the story's complications. Here, Dante's decision sets up the plot's ensuing conflict. 4. Rising Action: Predictably, Dante's plan fails, leaving him with no money to return. Meanwhile, Liam discovers the missing money and becomes suspicious. An immediate quarrel ensues which strains their bond, leaving a void in their relationship. Step 4 Justification: The rising action develops the story's conflict, heightening the main characters' problems and deepening their struggles. 5. Climax: A local cycle race is announced with a prize of 5000, enough to replace the stolen money and buy the race bike. Dante, feeling guilty, decides to enter the race to win that money, despite having no experience in competitive cycling. Step 5 Justification: A climax is the turning point of the story and leads it towards a resolution. Here, Dante's decision to compete serves just that purpose.  6. Falling Action: Dante begins to train rigorously but is undoubtedly the underdog. Liam, though still angry, watches silently from sidelines. Despite numerous setbacks and temptations to quit, Dante perseveres. Step 6 Justification: Falling action starts resolving the conflicts and tensions of the story, leading to the movie’s conclusion. 7. Resolution: On race day, Dante manages to win by a hair's breadth, earning not only the prize money but also Liam's respect. He returns the stolen 50 and contributes the rest towards Liam's dream bike, mending their strained relationship. Step 7 Justification: The resolution ties up the story's loose ends, fulfilling character goals in a satisfying (though not always happy) way. 8. Ending Scene: The story closes with Liam participating in the National Cycling Championship with Dante cheering him on, showing the newfound harmony between the brothers. Step 8 Justification: The ending scene reinforces the resolution and leaves the audience with a final impression, concluding the movie on a hopeful note."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which London station has the code LST????","output":"The London station that has the code LST is London Liverpool Street Station. London Liverpool Street Station, often simply referred to as Liverpool Street, is a major railway and underground station in the northeast corner of the City of London, in the ward of Bishopsgate. It is one of the busiest railway stations in London, serving as the terminus of the West Anglia Main Line to Cambridge, the busier Great Eastern Main Line to Norwich, local and regional commuter trains operated by Greater Anglia, and Stansted Express services to Stansted Airport. The station was opened in 1874 by the Great Eastern Railway. It was designed by the Fairburn, to serve as the company's new terminus in London, replacing Bishopsgate station which was converted into a goods yard. The complex was substantially redeveloped and expanded during the mid-1980s, including the construction of an adjacent commercial estate, known as Broadgate. Liverpool Street is one of 18 UK stations managed by Network Rail. It has exits to Bishopsgate, Liverpool Street and the Broadgate development. The station has a central position in London's public transport system, being one of 19 stations in the city offering an interchange between National Rail, London Underground and, at street level, bus and taxi services. The underground station, also known as London Liverpool Street, is served by the Central, Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines. On the Central line, it lies between Bank and Bethnal Green. On the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines it is between Aldgate and Moorgate. The underground station, like the railway station, is managed by Network Rail. Regarding accessibility, facilities at the station for blind and partially sighted people include tactile markings on platform edges, staircases and lifts. There are also facilities available for those with mobility restrictions, including step-free access, ramps for train access, and disabled parking. For hard-of-hearing passengers, induction loops are in place. In terms of amenities, the station not only serves as a transportation hub, but also boasts numerous coffee shops, eateries, newsagents, shops, cash points, ticket machines, toilets and a dedicated lounge serving longer distance travellers. There's also a distinctive monumental sculpture, titled 'The Meeting Place', in the concourse, depicting a couple in a loving clinch, which has become one of the station's most noticeable features. Therefore, the 3-letter code \\"LST\\" represents a station that plays a crucial role in London's transportation network, providing a wide array of services to millions of passengers every year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"The sentence translates to \\"For example, the political parties in the Netherlands have a century of experience.\\" As requested, I would like to expand on this. The Netherlands, also known as Holland, has a deeply rooted political history that has shaped its contemporary landscape. The parliamentary constitutional monarchy has allowed for a multi-party system to flourish. The Political parties in the Netherlands play a pivotal role in its democratic structure. The country is renowned for its consensus democracy, which essentially means that decisions are made collaboratively, with multiple parties often forming coalitions to govern. Their political party structure is diverse and versatile, ranging from the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) on the right to Labour Party (PvdA) on the left. Other parties showing significant influence include the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Democrats 66 (D66), Party for Freedom (PVV), and the Socialist Party (SP). The long history of these political parties has allowed them to adapt to the changing political climates, handling situations varying from economic crises to national security threats, socio-cultural issues to international diplomatic relations and more. Their long-standing experience, of over a century as mentioned, is not just revered within the nation but also internationally. Each party prides itself in specific core philosophies and works towards building consensus around these ideologies in house of representatives, functioning under a proportional representation system. Be it advocating for health care reforms, sustainable development, foreign policy, or domestic law enforcement, these parties with their century-old roots provide a robust framework through which the nation navigates its political course. Their vast experience over numerous years is evidence of their resiliency and adaptability, reflecting the country's dynamic democratic lifestyle.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Waking Life is about an unnamed[3] young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other charactersâranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friendsâabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of AndrÃ© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to...

Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles.

Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.  After reading the above, is \\"No More Ladies\\" the correct answer to the question \\"List 2 of the movies the Fontaine and De Havilland sisters won Oscars for?\\"?","output":"No, \\"No More Ladies\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"List 2 of the movies the Fontaine and De Havilland sisters won Oscars for?\\".

Title: The Man in the Iron Mask Movie plot: In 1638, King Louis XIII of France is delighted when his wife bears him a son, Louis, the heir to the throne. However, a few minutes later, a second son is born. Colbert (Walter Kingsford), the king's trusted adviser, persuades the king to secretly send the second child, Philippe, away to Gascony to be raised by his majesty's dear friend, d'Artagnan (Warren William), in order to avert a possible civil war later. Fouquet (Joseph Schildkraut), a mere cardinal's messenger at the time, finds out about the twin and uses this to advance his career. Twenty years later, he is the Minister of Finance under Louis XIV. The king is hated by the commoners for levying oppressive taxes and for executioning them for not paying them. Fouquet sends soldiers to force d'Artagnan and his people to pay the taxes, though the old king had exempted him and his village from them. They are driven off, but return in much greater numbers and, with great difficulty, capture d'Artagnan, the three musketeers and Philippe. Louis is about to order their executions when Colbert tells him about Philippe's uncanny resemblance to him. As Louis is aware of an assassination attempt to take place that day (but not where or when), he makes Philippe impersonate him in exchange for his friends' lives. Philippe not only survives the ambush, he shows mercy to his would-be killers and is cheered by the people. Princess Maria Theresa (Joan Bennett), whom Louis is to wed to seal an alliance with Spain, finds this new Louis much more attractive than the real one. However, when she discovers that Louis is having an affair with Mademoiselle de la Valliere (Marion Martin), she returns to Spain. When the truth is discovered, Louis has Philippe imprisoned with an iron mask placed on his head, hoping that Philippe's beard will grow inside the mask and eventually suffocate him. Philippe is rescued by the musketeers, who break into the sleeping Louis's chamber and imprison him in the mask. The musketeers drag him away and lock him in the Bastille, where the jailers...

Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.)

No arrests have been made so far, but investigations have begun, Chhattisgarh's Home Secretary N.K. Aswal said. The assault on a convoy of politicians from the country's ruling Congress party also killed Mahendra Karma, founder of a controversial anti-Maoist tribal militia called Salwa Judam, or the Purification Hunt, authorities say. At least 16 cars in the motorcade of local Congress leaders were passing through a forested area in the eastern Indian state when Maoists triggered a land mine and opened fire on them, area Police Superintendent Mayank Srivastava told CNN.

Read and understand the question: From the question, we can infer that we are looking for a sauce that someone dripped on the sofa bed while eating. 2. Examine the options: To find the correct answer, we need to assess the options provided.     - basement: This is a location within a house, not a sauce.     - guest room: This is another location within a house, not a sauce.     - horseradish: This is a tangy sauce made from the grated root of the horseradish plant, fitting the description in the question.     - bathroom: This is a location within a house, not a sauce.     - living room: This is another location within a house, not a sauce. 3.

Options: - urban area - busy - airport - boarding bus - towns A:","output":"According to the given options, the most suitable answer to the question \\"In smaller ___ are there less needs for a bus stop?\\" would be towns. It is more in line with common sense to assume that smaller towns have less need for a bus stop when compared to other options. This is because smaller towns generally have fewer people living in them, and the population is generally more spread out than in urban areas, airports, or busy districts. As a result, the demand for public transportation, such as bus stops, is lower in small towns. In contrast, urban areas often have higher population densities, more traffic, and a greater demand for public transportation to help people commute efficiently within the city. Busy areas and airports are also places where the demand for transport is higher due to the influx of people working, traveling, or visiting these areas. Boarding buses typically require a bus stop or bus station to function, so this option does not represent the scenario where there is less need for a bus stop. In conclusion, smaller towns have less need for bus stops compared to urban areas, busy places, airports, and boarding buses. The lower population density and the spread-out nature of small towns mean that there is not as high of a demand for public transportation, making it more logical to have fewer bus stops in these areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A guy with a red sweater and jeans jumping while holding onto a table at a bowling alley.\\" true if \\"A guy with a red sweater and jeans sitting down.\\"?","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the two premises in detail and evaluate if one can imply the other. First premise: \\"A guy with a red sweater and jeans jumping while holding onto a table at a bowling alley.\\" This premise presents a situation where a man is wearing a red sweater and jeans. He is specifically involved in an action of jumping and holding onto a table. Additionally, all these actions are taking place at a bowling alley. Second premise: \\"A guy with a red sweater and jeans sitting down.\\" In this second premise, we have a man with the same dressing sense, wearing a red sweater and jeans. However, the action mentioned here is different: the man is sitting down. There is no specific location mentioned for this scenario. Now, let's analyze if the first premise can be true if the second premise is true. These two scenarios describe different actions being performed by a man wearing the same outfit: a red sweater and jeans. In the first premise, the man is jumping and holding onto a table at a bowling alley, while in the second premise, he is sitting down with no specified location. It's plausible that both premises describe the same man. However, the key aspect here is the difference in actions and locations between the two premises. The first premise cannot be true if the second premise is true, as they depict the man in different situations involving contrasting actions. A person cannot simultaneously be sitting down and jumping while holding onto a table. These actions are mutually exclusive. Additionally, the lack of location in the second premise prevents any connection between the two premises. So, no, the first premise cannot be true if the second premise is true. They are distinct situations and cannot coexist or imply one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.
