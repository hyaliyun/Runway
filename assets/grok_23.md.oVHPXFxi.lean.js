How to breed livebearing tropical fish  Select the species you would like to breed.  Several varieties of livebearers are available from most pet stores, including guppies, platies, mollies, swordtails, and endlers. All of these have similar needs. OPT: [i] Figure out your fish's specific needs before breeding them so that you can breed them together. Some types of livebearers-birds, shrimp, turtles, amphibians-live in tropical environments. [ii] Choose several livebearers based on your needs, regardless of what type of fish you choose. To choose multiple livebearers, inspect the specific species you would like to breed to figure out the potential cost. [iii] Choosing the species that best meets your needs will help you make the best use of your time. Tropical livebearers are approximately 7.8 feet (2.7 m) in length. [iv] Whichever variety you select, ask for a 50/50 mix of males and females. Livebearers will do well in a standard 20-30 gallon tank setup. Answer:","output":"[i] Figure out your fish's specific needs before breeding them so that you can breed them together. Some types of livebearers, such as birds, shrimp, turtles, and amphibians, live in tropical environments. Each species has a unique set of requirements, making it essential to understand these before attempting breeding. In the case of livebearing tropical fish, there are various factors that you need to consider to ensure a successful reproduction process. Firstly, it's important to provide the proper tank conditions. Since these fish come from tropical environments, they require stable water temperatures in the range of 72-80°F (22-27°C). This can be easily maintained using a reliable heater and a thermometer to monitor the temperature. Apart from this, ensuring a consistent pH level between 7.0 and 8.0 is vital for their health and breeding success. To achieve this, regular water testing must be carried out, and suitable buffering agents or water additives can be used, if necessary. Moreover, livebearers generally prefer densely-planted tanks, which provide them with a sense of security, opportunities to establish territories, and ideal spots for nurturing their fry. To create this environment, you can add a variety of plants, including Java moss, Hornwort, or Water Sprite that provide good hiding spots for the young ones. Additionally, a good quality air pump and filter system are crucial to maintaining appropriate oxygen levels and keeping the water clean. Another crucial aspect is providing a balanced and nutritious diet to the fish you want to breed. You can feed them a mix of high-quality flake food, pellets, and live or frozen foods. A diversified diet rich in vitamins and minerals will increase their overall health and reproductive success. Furthermore, when selecting the fish for breeding, you need to look for healthy and vibrant specimens. A good ratio to maintain is one male to two or three females, as it prevents excessive competition or harassment among the male fish. It's essential to understand the specific breeding behavior and compatibility of the fish species you choose. For instance, guppies can be bred with endlers, mollies with sailfin mollies, and platies with swordtails. However, it's crucial to avoid breeding closely-related fish, as this could result in genetic issues and unhealthy offspring. Lastly, to monitor the progress of breeding effectively, it may be useful to set up a separate breeding tank or employ a breeding box within the main tank. This dedicated space isolates the pregnant females and reduces stress, granting them a secure place to give birth. It protects the fry from being eaten by other tank-mates and helps ensure their survival until they can be introduced to the community.  In conclusion, the key to successfully breeding livebearing tropical fish is to thoroughly understand the specific needs and requirements of the chosen species, provide them with a well-maintained habitat, and ensure optimum conditions for their reproduction and fry's development. Planning and dedication will lead to a higher chance of success in breeding and raising healthy, vibrant tropical fish in your aquarium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Painter's tape is used in part to make cleaning up easier.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that painter's tape is used in part to make cleaning up easier from the given context. The context provides a detailed explanation of using painter's tape while sponge painting a bathroom and highlights its utility in the process. Painter's tape, a versatile and indispensable tool for any painting project, is designed to protect specific areas from paint, create paint-free zones, and ensure sharp and clean lines in the finished paint job. In the context provided, the tape is applied to important areas where the bathroom walls meet the ceiling, doorjambs, wood trim, and tile. These areas are typically adjacent to the sections being painted, but not intended to be painted themselves. By protecting these areas with painter's tape, you can achieve a result with neater edges and a more professional appearance. Additionally, it ensures that paint does not accidentally spill or spread onto unintended surfaces, so you avoid mistakes and preserve the original appearance of those sections. Using painter's tape not only streamlines the final result, but it also helps simplify the cleaning process after the painting is completed. If paint were to make contact with unwanted surfaces, attempting to remove it afterward would be time-consuming and laborious, taking away from the overall efficiency of the project. By preventing paint from reaching these areas in the first place, painter's tape greatly reduces the amount of time and effort necessary for cleanup. In conclusion, the hypothesis that painter's tape is used in part to make cleaning up easier can be drawn from the provided context. The use of painter's tape in sponge painting a bathroom serves several purposes, such as protecting surfaces, ensuring precise lines, and, indeed, simplifying the cleanup process after the painting is finished."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who did Karl become a father figure to? Title: Sling Blade Movie plot: Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover. Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle. Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature, unwanted, newborn brother. He visits his father (Robert Duvall), who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home...

Problem:The Romans under Nero Claudius Drusus established a military outpost belonging to the Germania Superior Roman province at Strasbourg's current location, and named it Argentoratum. (Hence the town is commonly called Argentina in medieval Latin.) The name \\"Argentoratum\\" was first mentioned in 12 BC and the city celebrated its 2,000th birthday in 1988. \\"Argentorate\\" as the toponym of the Gaulish settlement preceded it before being Latinized, but it is not known by how long. The Roman camp was destroyed by fire and rebuilt six times between the first and the fifth centuries AD: in 70, 97, 235, 355, in the last quarter of the fourth century, and in the early years of the fifth century. It was under Trajan and after the fire of 97 that Argentoratum received its most extended and fortified shape. From the year 90 on, the Legio VIII Augusta was permanently stationed in the Roman camp of Argentoratum. It then included a cavalry section and covered an area of approximately 20 hectares.

What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person Branca was the attorney for? from the following article ?  Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\".

Our main characters are Tasmin, a thoughtful and introverted young woman who is still mourning the loss of her sister Sadie, and Mona, Tasmin's spontaneous and bubbly best friend. They grew up together, and Mona has been a support system for Tasmin since her sister's death. Step 2: Establish the Sisters' Relationship Tasmin and Sadie were inseparable, and Sadie had always been the more outgoing and adventurous sibling, often leading Tasmin to experience things she otherwise wouldn't. Sadie's death in a tragic accident has deeply impacted Tasmin, causing her to become more reclusive and immersed in her own thoughts. Step 3: Introduce the Red Dress During an attempt to lift Tasmin's spirits, Mona convinces her to go on a shopping trip with her. Mona, seeing a stunning red dress at a boutique, insists that Tasmin should try it on. However, upon seeing Mona wear the red dress, Tasmin is suddenly reminded of an impactful memory with her sister. Unbeknownst to Mona, Sadie owned a similar dress which she wore to a memorable occasion that Tasmin cherishes. Step 4: Develop the Mystery Tasmin is hesitant to share her feelings about the red dress with Mona. She becomes intrigued and consumed by the memory her sister wearing the similar dress on that special night, and embarks on a journey to uncover the deeper meaning behind the connection and Sadie's untold story. Step 5: Mona's Involvement As Tasmin delves into her sister's past and her thoughts about the red dress, Mona realizes how important this journey is for her best friend. Despite initially being hurt by Tasmin's reluctance to share her feelings, Mona remains a supportive companion and helps Tasmin unravel the mystery.

Through this process, Tasmin develops a deeper understanding of her sister's life and helps her find closure and peace. Step 7: Conclusion In the end, it is revealed that the red dress is not only a symbol of Sadie's love for life, but also a reminder of the unbreakable bond between the two sisters. The journey allows Tasmin to honor her sister's memory, and she finally accepts that Sadie's spirit will always be with her. Additionally, this experience brings Mona and Tasmin closer, strengthening their friendship and showing how important it is to support one another during difficult times. The answer to the question is: When Mona tries on the red dress, Tasmin is reminded of her sister Sadie's death, as Sadie had worn a similar red dress to a memorable occasion.

Q: Context: Metformin may benefit the macrovascular complications of diabetes independently of its conventional hypoglycemic effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory processes participate in type 2 diabetes and its atherothrombotic manifestations. Therefore, this study examined the potential action of metformin as an inhibitor of pro-inflammatory responses in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), macrophages (Mphis), and endothelial cells (ECs).', 'Metformin dose-dependently inhibited IL-1beta-induced release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in ECs, SMCs, and Mphis. Investigation of potential signaling pathways demonstrated that metformin diminished IL-1beta-induced activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in SMCs. Furthermore, metformin suppressed IL-1beta-induced activation of the pro-inflammatory phosphokinases Akt, p38, and Erk, but did not affect PI3 kinase (PI3K) activity. To address the significance of the anti-inflammatory effects of a therapeutically relevant plasma concentration of metformin (20 micromol/L), we conducted experiments in ECs treated with high glucose. Pretreatment with metformin also decreased phosphorylation of Akt and protein kinase C (PKC) in ECs under these conditions. Answer: These data suggest that metformin can exert a direct vascular anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting NF-kappaB through blockade of the PI3K-Akt pathway. The novel anti-inflammatory actions of metformin may explain in part the apparent clinical reduction by metformin of cardiovascular events not fully attributable to its hypoglycemic action.

These popular cosmetics   are sold in more than 130 countries. Who's the woman behind this worldwide cosmetics empire  ? Estee Lauder herself, of course. This businesswoman became, for a time, the world's richest self-made woman. Her secret? \\"I didn't get there by dreaming about it,\\" she would say. \\"I got there by doing it.\\" Estee was born in the early 1900s in Queens, New York. Her father ran a hardware   store, and from him Estee learned how to be a successful salesperson. Estee learned from her uncle John Schotz, too. He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick   and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop. In 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe. After many tries she succeeded and began selling her products in some stores in London. But France proved even more difficult. The store Galleries Lafayette refused to sell her products. So Estee \\"by accident\\" dropped a bottle of youth dew   on the floor in the cosmetics department. As the _ spread around the store, customers came over and asked to buy it. The store soon began selling Estee's products. Estee led her company until 1982, when her son Leonard took over the business. Until her health worsened in the mid-1990s, she continued to attend the opening of a new store wherever in the world. She died on April 24, 2004. Estee Lauder's talent as a saleswoman was extraordinary. Her son Leonard said, \\"There was never anyone who could sell like she could.\\" All who worked for Estee appreciated her special talent.

Sentence:","output":"Albert Jennings Fountain, born in New York's Staten Island, met his demise in the New Mexico Territory, United States, on February 1, 1896. To delve deeper into the details provided, Albert Jennings Fountain was a prominent individual in American history. He was born on Staten Island, New York, which is the southernmost of New York City's five boroughs. Over the course of his life, Fountain lived through a variety of major events that defined the landscape of the United States.  His birthplace hints at a northeast upbringing, close to the bustle of metropolitan life in one of the most significant cities in the United States, and by extension, the world. This kind of urban upbringing could have exposed Fountain to a variety of cultural influences, from the European immigrants pouring into the city to the evolving landscape of American politics, literature, and art. However, despite the urban roots, Fountain met his death in a starkly different locale: the New Mexico Territory in the United States. The New Mexico Territory, an organized area of the United States that existed from 1850 to 1912, would have presented a stark contrast to Life in New York. It was characterized by shifting cultural dynamics between Native American and European settlers, the distinct flavors of southwestern culture, and the untamed wilderness of the American desert landscape.

The Jenkins Orphanage was established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on a variety of instruments and were able to read music expertly. These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. William \\"Cat\\" Anderson, Jabbo Smith, and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional musicians in some of the best bands of the day.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. Question: What is the researchers' concern over the increase of birds' song output? Answer: A:","output":"The researchers' concern over the increase of birds' song output is based on the adverse effects it can have on the birds' health and well-being. According to the British-based researchers, including David Dominoni from Glasgow University, the birds, specifically robins, are singing more due to exposure to artificial light from street lamps, takeaway signs, and homes. This light pollution affects their biological clock and makes them active during both day and night. The increased song output requires more energy, leading to potential negative consequences for the birds. Singing is a costly behavior that demands energy, and by increasing their song output, the birds might face energy-related costs, such as exhaustion or reduced time for other crucial activities like resting, foraging, or mating. Additionally, the disrupted biological clock from light exposure can lead to gene expression alterations, causing genes to be active at incorrect times of the day. Furthermore, it is not just robins that are being affected by artificial light; other bird species, such as blackbirds and seagulls, are also experiencing increased nocturnal behaviors due to the same issue. As a result, researchers are concerned that these unnatural changes in birds' behaviors may lead to potential risks in their overall health and survival."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Navy SEAL turned author who was there as Osama bin Laden was killed and promised to 'set the record straight' about the mission that led to his demise has been identified as a soldier who has since retired from service. The book's publisher announced on Wednesday that Mark Owen's 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' would tell the real story about the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011. The book, to be published under the pseudonym 'Mark Owen,' is scheduled to be released on September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC. But the former serviceman's attempts to remain anonymous were foiled on Thursday, when FoxNews.com identified him as Matt Bissonnette, 36, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, who retired shortly after the bin Laden mission. Publisher Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group, asked news organizations on Thursday to withhold his name. But that didn’t stop the Associated Press, which later confirmed the the FoxNews.com report through their own sources, and circulated the information through its subscribers. The revelation had alarm bells ringing in military circles. Pentagon spokesman Lt Col James Gregory told MailOnline that the release of a former special ops soldier’s identity can be worrisome. He said: ‘We protect the names of our special ops personnel for security reasons. Any time names are revealed, it’s a concern.' Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday. In the dark: The Pentagon said that it has not seen a copy of the book, despite regulations designed to keep former and current military personnel from spilling military secrets. Lt Col Gregory also joined a chorus of U.S. agencies who claim they had no knowledge of the book before Wednesday, a possible violation of regulations that bar current and former troops from spilling military matters and national security issues. Other departments, including the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and even the White House, were also caught off-guard. That could spell trouble for Bissonnette, who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book. Lt Col Gregory said that since he is now a private citizen, the military could refer the investigation to the Department of Justice. Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan. Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House. But any judicial action would hinge on the content of No Easy Day. 'We. don't know what kind of details [are in the book], so we can't make a. determination over whether it's classified or not,' Lt Col Gregory said. But the publisher maintains that. Bissonnette's writings were properly vetted by a former special. operations attorney, and will not let any military cats out of the bag. Christine Ball, a spokeswoman for the Dutton, the publisher, told Reuters: 'He vetted it for tactical, technical, and procedural information as well as information that could be considered classified by compilation and found it to be without risk to national security.' Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down. No Easy Day is co-authored by journalist Kevin. Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last. year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan. Maurer. spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and. Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer. The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported on Wednesday that the book also goes into detail about Bissonnette's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL. The blog added that the book will. culminate with a 'blow by blow' account of the dramatic raid in the. terror leader's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound. No Easy Day's listing on Amazon.com. says that among Owen's hundreds of missions around the world as a SEAL Team. Six commando was the rescue of Capt Richard Phillips from Somali pirates. in 2009. Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama. Owen's book comes on the heels of. another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed. three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary. Clinton. That explosive allegation is. contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the. White House’s carefully-crafted narrative of Obama as a decisive leader. who took out the al-Qaeda leader despite the doubts of advisers is a. myth. Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him was published on Tuesday. A. film about the bin Laden raid, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker. director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19. Republicans chided the White House earlier this year amid reports that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal - who both won Academy Awards for The Hurt Locker - were given unprecedented access to classified information. The Obama administration denied the claims. Mission: Bin Laden was killed during the 40-minute operation by the elite Navy SEAL Team Six in his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound, seen here. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article tells us about a book named 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama bin Laden'. The author of this book used the name Mark Owen to keep his real identity a secret, but we later find out his real name is Matt Bissonnette, and he was a Navy SEAL. He was part of the team that went on a mission to find Osama bin Laden, a very bad man, in Pakistan in May 2011. Matt wrote this book to tell the world what really happened during that mission. The book was supposed to come out on September 11, which is a very sad day when bad people attacked New York and Washington, DC. But Matt's real name got out before the book was published, and this worried some people at the Pentagon, which is like the head office for the military, because they didn't want people to know who he really was for safety reasons. Some other important people, like those who work in the CIA and the White House, didn't know the book was coming out either. If the book has any secret information, it could get Matt in trouble. But the people who are publishing the book say it doesn't include anything that it shouldn't. The book also tells us about how Matt became a Navy SEAL and about some of his other missions. Another important thing to know is that there's a movie coming out about the same mission which is called Zero Dark Thirty."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: A video investigated in the disappearance of Antigo teen Kayla Berg in 2009 is fake and does not relate to an abduction or illegal activity, Police Chief Erick Roller said Wednesday.      Investigators found the producer of the one-minute clip and the two actors, including a women or girl depicted as tied up, kept in a dark room and screaming for help, Roller said.      \\"We determined that they produced the video as a series of videos and posted this one in October 2009,\\" he said in a statement. \\"They did not intend to depict any reference to our missing Kayla Berg.\\"      In an interview Wednesday, Roller said the video was made on the East Coast by the two actors - both adults - but he wouldn't specify where.

The video titled, \\"Hi Walter! I got a new gf!\\" was posted back in October of 2009, just a couple months after her disappearance. In it, a man describes an encounter with his new girlfriend, and then shows a woman who appears to be held captive in a locked room. That video has since been removed from the site.      Kayla's mom Hope Sprenger was concerned that the girl in the video could be her missing daughter.      \\"[It] sounded like her, looked like her, it gave me chills,\\" Sprenger said. \\"Disturbing. \\"It made me sick to my stomach.\\"      Sprenger said certain details in the video had her concerned.      \\"The clothing could be a big possibility,\\" she said. \\"We do believe she was wearing that type of shirt, we know she had jeans.\\"      Kronenwetter Police Chief Daniel Joling said Tuesday the man in the video is not a resident of Kronenwetter and \\"I can attest to the fact unequivocally that the video was not taken in the residence here in the village.\\"      For Sprenger, the video is a reminder of the nightmare that began seven years ago.      \\"I thought it looked a lot like her,\\" she said. \\"I pray to God it's not.\\"      Antigo Police also say the girl at the end of the video does resemble Berg. They've received numerous tips since the video surfaced, and are actively investigating its origin as well.      \\"We'll do whatever we can to find out who's in there and identify them,\\" Police Chief Eric Roller said. \\"Sometimes that's hard on the web because of wherever this stuff may originate from [but] we're going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of it.

While some people propose that certain images are universal, most psychiatrists feel your personal connection with a color is more important than what that color symbolizes on a winder scale. When you think of red, what do you think of? While your personal connection is the most important, it can help to at least familiarize yourself with some theory on color and dreams. In dreams, red has sometimes been said to symbolize intense feelings. People also tend to associate red with increased activity and intense emotions like anger, passion, determination, and general excitement. Physically, red has a stimulating effect on blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration. Learn to trust yourself. You are the expert in regards to your unconscious mind. As dreams are heavily based in personal associations, memories, and relationships, you're the best judge of what symbols in your dreams mean. Do not rely too heavily on outside opinions and research. Allow yourself to interpret the dream based on your own feelings and experiences. Once you've gone through and recorded the dream and your feelings, put it all together. Considering all factors, what do you think the dream means?  Let's return to the tent example. For the sake of this example, you're a middle-aged divorced man. Say, in this dream, you felt at peace. The cat you were petting was a cat you had in childhood that died. You used to camp in your backyard as a young boy, sometimes with other children and sometimes alone. Lately, you've been having recurring thoughts about aging. You just turned 40 and are becoming more aware of how quickly time passes. You associate red with your wedding day, as the bridesmaids wore red dresses. Perhaps the red tent dream points to the fact you're missing better times. You may feel you're past your peak in life and long to return to a time of promise and potential. The red in the dream points to your wedding, a time of new beginnings and hope. The dream may be a sign you need to acknowledge and deal with your feelings of depression and regret. Summary:","output":"In order to interpret a dream, it's important to consider personal associations with symbols and colors within the dream rather than relying solely on universal meanings. In the case of red, it can symbolize intense feelings, increased activity, and strong emotions like anger, passion, and determination. However, your personal connection to the color red may be different. To interpret your dream, follow these steps: 1. Record the dream and your feelings about it. 2. Consider your personal associations with the symbols and colors present in the dream. 3. Reflect on your memories and experiences that may be related to the dream. 4. Don't rely too heavily on outside opinions and research. 5. Trust yourself as the best judge of what the symbols in your dream mean. 6. Combine all the factors and your personal associations to interpret the dream. For example, if you dreamt of a red tent and you are a middle-aged divorced man who associates red with your wedding day, the dream may signify a longing for better times and new beginnings. This could indicate a need to address feelings of depression and regret. In summary, trust your personal associations with symbols and colors in your dreams, and remember that you are the best judge of their meanings as they are connected to your own experiences and memories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What legendary island is said to have sunk?","output":"The legendary island said to have sunk is Atlantis. Atlantis is an ancient mythological island civilization that has intrigued people for centuries. The story of Atlantis first appeared in the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, in his dialogues \\"Timaeus\\" and \\"Critias,\\" written around 360 BCE. According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful and highly advanced civilization that existed 9,000 years before his own time, which would place it around 9,600 BCE.  In these dialogues, Plato stated that Atlantis was located \\"beyond the pillars of Hercules.\\" These pillars were considered to be the boundaries of the \\"known world,\\" and are usually identified today as the Strait of Gibraltar, the narrow passage connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean between Spain and Morocco. This geographical placement has led to numerous debates and speculations about the exact location of this lost continent or island, with theories ranging from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean to the North Sea. Atlantis is portrayed as a highly advanced and technologically sophisticated society, ruled by a wise and benevolent elite. According to the texts, the people of Atlantis enjoyed an elaborate system of canals, harbors, and bridges. They had a strong navy and possessed advanced engineering techniques, which allowed them to build magnificent temples, palaces, and public spaces. The natural resources on the island were said to be abundant, providing its people with enormous wealth and prosperity. Despite this great wealth and advanced knowledge, the Atlanteans are said to have become increasingly corrupt and power-hungry. They began to expand their empire with conquests throughout the ancient world, leading to wars with other civilizations. In the end, their hubris contributed to their eventual downfall. According to Plato's account, the Greek gods, led by Zeus, decided to punish the people of Atlantis for their hubris, greed and corruption. In a single day and night of catastrophic earthquakes and floods, the entire island of Atlantis sank beneath the waves and was lost forever. The story of this lost civilization has captivated the imaginations of scholars, historians, and treasure hunters for centuries. Some believe that the story of Atlantis was a cautionary tale told by Plato to demonstrate the dangers of excessive pride, while others see it as an allegory for the ancient struggle between the forces of good and evil. However, despite extensive research and numerous attempts to locate the lost island, no definitive evidence has ever been found to support the existence of Atlantis. As such, the story is largely considered a myth or legend rather than historical fact. Over the years, a wide range of theories has been proposed to explain the story's origins, including the possibility that it was based on ancient memories of genuine cataclysmic events, such as the destruction of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, or the volcanic eruption of Thera (now known as Santorini). Regardless of its factual basis, the story of Atlantis continues to enchant and fascinate people today, inspiring countless works of literature, movies, and even expeditions in search of this legendary sunken island."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In line with the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2013 and for several months, Greece produced more than 20% of its electricity from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants. Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation, however in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"In the year 2008, which is eight years after the year 2000, the European Union's energy production from renewable sources stood at an average of 10%. This figure is derived from the context provided, which states that renewable energy accounted for 10% of the EU's energy production in 2008. It is important to note that this percentage varied among EU member states, with some countries producing more or less than the average amount from renewable energy sources. In the case of Greece, it is mentioned that 8% of the country's total energy consumption in 2008 came from renewable sources, a 0.8% increase compared to the 7.2% in 2006. The majority of Greece's renewable energy was generated from biomass and waste recycling, with only 10% coming from solar power. The European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy set a target for Greece to reach 18% of its energy production from renewable sources by 2020. In 2013, Greece achieved more than 20% of its electricity production from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants for several months, indicating progress toward meeting their target. Greece is unique compared to some other EU countries in that it does not have any nuclear power plants in operation. However, in 2009, the Academy of Athens suggested beginning research into the possibility of introducing nuclear power plants to the country as an additional energy source. In conclusion, in 2008, the European Union's energy production from renewable sources averaged 10%, with Greece accounting for 8% of its total energy consumption from renewable sources. Greece's efforts to increase its renewable energy production were evident through its progress in 2013 when more than 20% of its electricity was generated from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric power plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this statement, the speaker expresses that both they and the British government share the traditional opinion that the proposed center is not essential. According to their viewpoint, establishing the center would be an inefficient and unnecessary duplication of resources and structures that are already in place. The concern is that creating another center would lead to wasteful spending and could potentially create confusion or overlap with the roles and responsibilities of existing institutions. The primary argument here is that effective use and allocation of resources, as well as streamlined and efficient communication between organizations, are key to the success of any endeavor. Instead of creating a separate and possibly redundant center, both the speaker and the British government believe it would be more advantageous to focus on optimizing and consolidating the existing structures to better serve their intended purposes. This way, resources and budget allocations can be maximized in order to improve the overall performance, reach, and impact of current institutions. It is crucial, however, to thoroughly evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of not establishing a new center alongside the assessment of the existing structures. Identifying opportunities for improvement within existing organizations can lead to more effective decision-making and ultimately contribute to better outcomes. There may be shared objectives or unique capabilities that could be better addressed through a collaborative approach with the potential new center. By maintaining this traditional stance against the creation of another center, the goal is to ensure a strong and unified effort without sacrificing valuable resources in the process.

The food they serve is called French food, which is from a country called France.  Now, if people want to eat at Strada, they need to know it costs a bit more money compared to other places. How much? Well, it is more than £30, which is like 30 small coins with the \\"£\\" sign on them.  When people talk about how they like a place, they give it a rating. For Strada, the customer rating is low. This means that not everyone likes it very much. Also, Strada is not family-friendly, so it might not be the best place for kids like you, or families with kids to go there and eat. Lastly, Strada is near a place called Rainbow Vegetarian Café. It's like saying your friend's house is close to your school – it helps people know where something is. So there you have it!

Input: The mix-up delayed the women's football match, at Glasgow's Hampden Park on the first day of sporting action. The men's football gets under way later, with matches including Britain v Senegal at 20:00 BST (19:00 GMT). Speaking to BBC News, Prime Minister David Cameron highlighted benefits of the Games, and said: \\"The real legacy is the inspiration to young people.\\" He added: \\"People are going to be coming to our country over the next few weeks and seeing a really inspiring sight. \\"That's about a people's Olympics, not a government Olympics.\\" In other news: 'Very upset' The BBC's sports editor David Bond said the flag mix-up at Hampden Park had been an \\"embarrassing mistake\\" and not the start Games organisers would have wanted, but \\"no great harm was done\\". As the North Korean players were being introduced before the match against Colombia, South Korean flags were mistakenly displayed in the video package. The squad walked off and could only be persuaded to return when the teams were announced again with each player's face displayed next to the North Korean flag, delaying kick-off by about an hour. Relations between the two Koreas are tense - they remain technically at war following the 1950-53 Korean conflict, which ended in an armistice. Speaking after the match, North Korea's coach Sin Ui Gun said: \\"Our team was not going to participate unless the problem was solved properly... \\"Unfortunately it took some time later for the broadcast to be done again properly and we made the decision to go on with the match.\\" It was not immediately clear who had produced the video shown in the stadium. London 2012 spokesman Andy Mitchell said: \\"The South Korean flag was shown in the video package on the screen before the kick-off and the North Koreans were naturally very upset about that... \\"A genuine mistake was made for which we apologise.\\" BBC Scotland football reporter Alasdair Lamont said that during the delay to the game the crowd had become frustrated at a lack of information. \\"I don't think there was any reason given the entire time before the kick-off eventually took place as to why there had been a hold-up,\\" he said. \\"They were simply given a couple of messages saying there was 'an issue behind the scenes, we're doing our best to resolve it', and that was basically it.\\" One spectator, Paul, told BBC Radio 5 live: \\"An announcement was made that there was a technical problem behind the scenes, and even then when the players came back on, they came back on for a second warm-up, and quite a large portion of the crowd started booing.\\" North Korea's state news agency KCNA made no mention of the blunder in its report on Thursday of the team's 2-0 victory over Colombia. North Korea will face South Korea in the first round of the men's Olympic table tennis team event after the pair were drawn against each other on Wednesday. 'Value for money' In an interview on BBC Breakfast, asked about benefits to the wider UK from the London 2012 Games, Mr Cameron said: \\"I think we will get value for money as a country.\\" He said that the Games were expected to come in under their £9bn budget, while there were predicted to be \\"£13bn in economic benefits from the deals that are going to be done, the extra spending, the extra tourism and all the rest of it\\". The nation would enjoy the physical infrastructure left by the Games, he said, giving the example of the aquatics centre's expected 800,000 visitors a year. \\"But the real legacy is the inspiration to young people who will want to take up sport, who will be inspired by the competitive ethos of the Olympics, who will see Britain at its best,\\" the prime minister said. The opening match in the men's football gets under way at 12:00 BST at Hampden Park when Honduras take on Morocco, followed by Spain v Japan. Matches are also taking place at St James' Park in Newcastle, Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and the City of Coventry Stadium.

It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It's a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times. But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10. p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.

Read this and answer the question In the US Air Force, the distinction between bombers, fighters that are actually fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.

Summarize: New York Judge Thomas Griesa said the plan was \\"lawless\\". However, he stopped short of finding the country in contempt of court. Argentina was trying to get around an earlier court ruling banning it from paying interest to investors who had accepted restructured bonds. Mr Griesa ruled in July that the country must first pay the hedge funds holding out for full payment on the bonds on which it defaulted in 2001. \\"I want to be very clear, this proposal is a violation of the current orders of this court... it is illegal and the court directs that it cannot be carried out,\\" Mr Griesa said on Thursday. The hedge funds, which bought Argentina's bonds at a big discount after its economic meltdown and previous default in 2001-02, are owed an estimated 1.3bn (Â£766m). Argentina has consistently refused to pay them, saying it cannot afford to do so, and called them \\"vultures\\" for refusing to swap their bonds for lesser valued ones. Mr Griesa likened Argentina's stance to a man showing up to complete a house purchase with only 80,000 to buy a 100,000 property and insisting: \\"80,000 is a lot of money and my family is ready to move in\\". \\"He would be laughed out of the neighbourhood,\\" the judge added. On Thursday, Mr Griesa urged the two sides to try and find a compromise. \\"If we can have a process leading to settlement, that is the path that  should be taken,\\" the judge said. In July, Argentina's Economy Minister Axel Kicillof flew to New York to try to make a deal with the hedge funds. However, the talks broke down, forcing Argentina to default on its debt - its second default in 13 years - thus exacerbating problems in its recession-hit economy. Summary:","output":"New York Judge Thomas Griesa deemed Argentina's plan to pay interest to investors who accepted restructured bonds as \\"lawless\\" and a violation of a court ruling. Argentina has been attempting to circumvent a previous ruling that requires it to first pay hedge funds holding out for full payment on the bonds it defaulted on in 2001. The holdout hedge funds are owed approximately 1.3bn. Griesa has urged both parties to find a compromise, while Argentina's economy suffers from the repercussions of its second default in 13 years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I planned a trip to the grocery store which scarily enough feels like a getaway sometimes . I also thought I might go to Starbucks , have a coffee ( because a 103 degree day is a great day to go for a coffee ) , and read or journal . why does she want to read or journal at starbucks ?","output":"The desire to read or journal at Starbucks rather than at home, especially during a break from being a mom, could be attributed to several reasons. Let's explore them in detail: 1. Change of Scenery: Constantly being in the same environment can make a person feel overwhelmed, restless, or even bored. Going to an entirely different place like Starbucks can provide a refreshing change of scenery, offering a fresh perspective and mental clarity. This change can make the experience of reading or journaling much more enjoyable and productive. 2. Escape from Home Responsibilities: Being a mom typically involves a long list of household chores and responsibilities. Escaping to Starbucks allows her to distance herself physically and mentally from these tasks, giving her an opportunity to focus solely on herself and her interests. This uninterrupted time is essential for personal growth, well-being, and self-care. 3. Social Atmosphere: Starbucks is known for its cozy and welcoming atmosphere, which often attracts people who want to work, read, or engage in creative activities in a pleasant environment. Unlike the solitude and peace that home offers, Starbucks has a degree of social interaction that might be appealing for some people. The background chatter, people watching opportunities, and brief interactions can be uplifting and inspiring without needing to focus intently on conversations or socializing. 4. Structure and Routine: Sometimes setting a routine and having a designated place to work or think can increase productivity and focus. Starbucks provides a structured environment where she can designate time specifically for reading or journaling. This helps in creating a disciplined approach to her personal goals. 5. Quality Coffee: Starbucks is famous for its coffee, and enjoying a delicious beverage can make a person feel good and provide a small treat to look forward to. Sitting down with a good coffee in Starbucks might help to set the mood for her reading or journaling session. 6. Me Time: Spending time at Starbucks allows her to have some \\"me time\\", which is crucial for maintaining a balance between her identity as a mom and her individuality. Reading or journaling at Starbucks provides her with an opportunity to reflect on her thoughts, emotions, and aspirations, which may not be easily feasible in the midst of her daily responsibilities as a parent. To sum up, she wants to read or journal at Starbucks because it offers an enjoyable change of scenery, escape from home responsibilities, a pleasant social atmosphere, a structured environment, quality coffee, and an opportunity for much-needed \\"me time\\". These factors play a vital role in making her experience of reading or journaling more enjoyable, effective, and relaxing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He looked to be in his late 40s but was probably a lot younger. He had shoulder length straight black hair and a short beard. Every day after work I would remember to gather any spare change, and put it aside to give to him if I saw him. A feeling of joy would come over me every time I saw him, while coming off the ramp  . So did he. Sometimes the red light would be on for a minute and we would ask each other about our day. His answer would always be the same, \\"I'm blessed!\\" Then one day I was called into my boss's office and was told that I was being laid off. For the rest of that day all I could think of was \\"how am I going to provide for my kids as a mother, how am I going to pay rent?\\" Needless to say that on my way home that day I was very sad and upset. I didn't remember to look for my spare change and keep it ready like I usually did. Yet there he was as always, as I turned the ramp. He set his eyes on me, while still smiling and waving at others as usual. While I was waiting for the red light to turn, he strolled   over to my car. He had a big smile. He looked at me straight in the eyes and said, \\"Today I will give you a dollar.\\" He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a dollar bill. You see that day he taught me a valuable lesson more than a dollar bill. No matter what material things are taken from you, no one can take away your choice to be joyful.

Summarize the following: The flexible hose will most likely be a rubber hose (sometimes it may be braided steel) leading from the central brake line to the caliper piston in disc brakes or the wheel cylinder in drum brakes. To disconnect the hose, you should remove the retainer clip between the hose and the steel line. Next, you can turn the connector with a wrench until it comes loose. Do not crank too much on these connections. If you do you may bend the metal brake lines and then have to replace them as well. Instead, drain the line by cutting the brake hose and use a torch to heat the connection. This will break it loose and you can remove it. The brake hose may be mounted to the strut or another sturdy point between the central line and the wheel. You will need to locate any such connections by tracing the line from end to end. Loosen and remove any mounting connections you find. Now that the hose is disconnected from the lines to the master cylinder, you need only remove it from the brake itself. To do this you need to loosen the bolt found at the end of the brake line (known as a banjo bolt). This is often done with a 14mm socket or wrench, but the size can vary depending on make and model. There is also a washer on either side of the brake line (between the line and banjo bolt and the line and brake) that needs removed. To attach the new brake hose, you will simply reverse the steps you took to remove the original. This means putting the washers in first, then tightening the banjo bolt at the end of the brake  hose. First, attach the retainer clip. This holds the brake hose in place while you make the connection and is usually attached by sliding it into the appropriate holder at the end of the brake hose. Next, fasten the connector between the brake hose and lines leading the the master cylinder. This should be done with a wrench or flare nut wrench. You should also reconnect any brackets that hold the line secure (often found on the struts or other steering component). Bleeding the brakes is necessary to remove air that you have introduced into your brake line. Open up the bleeder cap found on the brake caliper or wheel cylinder and have someone pump the brake to force the air out of the bleeder cap. Wait until you see fluid coming out of the bleeder cap, and then close the cap. There are also pressure bleeders and gravity bleeders available for bleeding brakes. Summary:","output":"To replace a flexible brake hose, first disconnect it by removing the retainer clip and loosening the connector with a wrench. Take care not to bend the metal brake lines.

[ii] Natalie is afraid..","output":"[i] Felicia is afraid that the condition might worsen if left untreated. As Felicia enters Dr. Natalie's clinic, she nervously fidgets with her phone. This is her first time visiting an eye specialist, and she's unsure of how the appointment will go. Step 1: Felicia checks in at the reception desk. As a first-time visitor, Felicia must provide her personal and insurance information so that Dr. Natalie's staff can process her paperwork. She fills out the necessary forms as accurately as possible to ensure a smooth experience. Step 2: Felicia waits for her consultation with Dr. Natalie. While Felicia waits in the comfortable waiting area, she tries to calm her nerves by reading a magazine. She knows it's essential to be relaxed during the eye examination, so her symptoms are accurately assessed.  Step 3: Dr. Natalie calls Felicia into her examination room. When it's time for her examination, Dr. Natalie greets Felicia warmly and invites her into the examination room. Felicia begins to feel more at ease thanks to Dr. Natalie's welcoming demeanor. Step 4: Felicia discusses her concerns with Dr. Natalie. Dr. Natalie begins by asking Felicia about the symptoms she's experiencing, such as itching, redness, or persistent discomfort. Felicia explains that she's had a growing discomfort in her eyes and has been feeling increasingly self-conscious about the redness. Step 5: Dr. Natalie conducts a thorough eye examination.  Taking Felicia's concerns seriously, Dr. Natalie uses specialized equipment to examine her eyes closely. This includes using a biomicroscope, which enables her to have a magnified look at the eye structure, especially focusing on the eyelids, lashes, and the surface of the eye. Step 6: Dr. Natalie determines a diagnosis. After carefully examining Felicia's eyes, Dr. Natalie determines that Felicia does have eye mites, also known as Demodex mites. As a knowledgeable and caring specialist, she reassures Felicia that this condition is treatable. Step 7: Dr. Natalie recommends a treatment plan. Dr. Natalie outlines a comprehensive treatment plan for Felicia, which includes an antiparasitic medication for the mites and advice on maintaining proper eyelid hygiene. She also prescribes eye drops to relieve the redness and inflammation. Step 8: Felicia follows the treatment plan diligently. Grateful for Dr. Natalie's expertise, Felicia commits to following her prescribed treatment plan, taking the medications as advised and maintaining good eyelid hygiene.  Over time, Felicia's symptoms subside, and her eyes return to their usual healthy state. This experience not only helps Felicia overcome her fear of visiting an eye specialist but also strengthens her understanding of the importance of regular eye care."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: The Cardiff University study found levels last year were broadly the same as in 2014. Previously, numbers had dropped each year since 2008. But the study found there was an 8% rise in victims over the age of 50. The survey collected data from A&E departments, minor injury units and walk-in centres. Last month the Home Office launched a crime reduction strategy which it said would make the most of new technology. An estimated 210,000 people attended hospital emergency departments for injuries as a result of violence last year. According to the survey it was the first year since 2008 that there was \\"no real change\\" in the figures, after successive annual falls. Prof Jonathan Shepherd, director of the Violence Research Group at Cardiff University, said: \\"After successive annual falls in overall levels of violence in England and Wales, this is the first time since 2008 violence in England and Wales serious enough to result in hospital treatment shows no real change. \\"This finding is also consistent with the latest report from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which also found that rates of violent incidents were no different in the year ending September 2015, compared with the previous 12 months. \\"It is possible that the long steady decline in violence in England and Wales has come to an end.\\" The researchers said one possible reason was that local authorities and police were spending less money on monitoring in real time footage from CCTV cameras which it is thought can help prevent violent incidents from escalating.

As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm. Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bicycle, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Danny is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Danny and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Danny to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to a fill-in shift as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. On the road, while continuing to track the massive storm creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southeast into Blainsworth, as the meteorologist he is radioing to is astonished at the uncharacteristic spring-like nature of the storm system for the fall; while there, he meets Laura and Jenny while getting some coffee at the diner.

Answer the following question: Renegade Republicans who are trying to force a vote on immigration reform in the House of Representatives survived an attempt by leaders of their party to block their efforts. The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Question: As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops. Scientists originally thought that   _  .

Baking soda absorbs and neutralizes all kinds of unpleasant smells and is a great ingredient to get rid of unwanted garlicky odors that may have been worked into a cutting board or other kitchen utensil. Combine the baking soda and water in a small bowl. Stir them together with a spoon until a thick, grainy paste forms. If not all of the baking soda is absorbed into the water, add a few more drops. If you’ve used, for example, a cutting board or measuring spoons with garlic and they still smell, try getting the smell off with the baking soda paste. Scoop the paste onto the surface of the utensil. Rub the paste into the object. Do this for 1–2 minutes to make sure that the baking soda paste eradicates all of the garlic odor. Some kitchen utensils may have the smell of garlic deeply engrained in them. In this case, if you have a lemon on hand, try cutting it in half and using half the lemon to rub the paste into your garlicky kitchen utensil. The lemon’s acidity will help further neutralize the garlic odor. Turn on your kitchen sink’s tap and hold the cutting board, measuring spoon, or other kitchen item beneath the running water. Rub 1 hand back and forth across the paste-covered surface until you’ve rinsed off all of the paste. Set your utensil in a drying rack and give it 2–3 hours to dry. Once it’s dry, sniff the cutting board. The unpleasant garlic smell should be gone! If you’re out of baking soda, vinegar works equally well as a deodorizer. You can use it to clean the same items that you can clean with baking soda. Just pour a little vinegar onto a clean sponge and scrub it across the surface of whatever kitchen items have an unpleasant garlicky smell. This works well on plastic cutting boards, frying pans, silverware, and even your stovetop. Also try pouring vinegar into a plastic spray bottle and spritzing it across larger items that smell like garlic. This works well for larger cutting boards and stovetops.

Usage: The sample input \\"Просыпается злость\\" is in Russian and contains the emotion label \\"anger\\". This meets the criteria because it follows the instruction of providing a text in Russian that contains one emotion label from the provided list. Part #2: You need to output the incorrect emotion label, which is irrelevant to the input text.  Usage: Assume the input only contains an implication of 'anger'. In this case, any other emotion label like 'joy', 'sadness', 'surprise', 'fear' would be irrelevant. If we consider 'joy', then 'joy' is an incorrect emotion label for the given input because the text is about 'anger', not 'joy'. Hence, they are irrelevant to each other.

For example, an output of 'joy' meets this criterion because it contains only one emotion label. Part #4: Your answer (ii) should be unambiguous. Usage: Your answer should be clear and not open to more than one interpretation. For instance, outputting 'joy' is unambiguous because it is a clear, singular emotion label.

Each of these words holds significance in the sentence and contributes to the overall meaning and imagery. 1. Sunlight: This represents the natural light emitted by the sun. Sunlight is the primary source of light and warmth in our world, playing a crucial role in plant photosynthesis, which in turn provides oxygen and sustenance, ultimately supporting all life on earth. In the given sentence, sunlight is the key component that sets the scene and creates the atmosphere. 2. Streams: The verb \\"streams\\" indicates the continuous flow or movement of sunlight. This word provides the reader with a visual representation of the flow of sunlight, creating an image of streaks or rays of light that pour through the window. By using \\"streams,\\" the sentence is able to convey the idea that sunlight enters the room in a gentle, fluid manner, which, in turn, helps build the scene's overall atmosphere. 3. Window: A window acts as an opening or portal in the walls of a building, allowing light to enter and offering a view of the exterior environment. In this context, the window serves as the conduit through which sunlight streams, shaping how the light enters the room and facilitating the connection between the indoors and the outdoors. The window plays a crucial role in the sentence because it acts as a frame, directing the reader's attention to the main action and determining how sunlight interacts with the room. 4. Room: A room is an enclosed space within a building, usually designated for a specific purpose, such as living, working, or dining. In this sentence, the room represents the interior area receiving the sunlight pouring in through the window. The term \\"room\\" helps establish the context within which the other words operate, setting the stage for the image being conveyed. In summary, the words \\"sunlight,\\" \\"streams,\\" \\"window,\\" and \\"room\\" work together to create a vivid image of a space illuminated by the natural light of the sun. These key terms contribute to the overall meaning of the sentence, helping to establish the atmosphere, convey motion, and provide a sense of space.

Background: Carroll was born in Joliet, Illinois on May 18, 1945. His father worked in a coal processing plant. The family moved to San Diego in 1954 where Carroll grew up. He describes his early years in Ocean Beach as an ideal childhood. Context: Carroll did not believe in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent god. However, in his essay \\"Why I am not an atheist\\", Carroll described his dislike of the term \\"atheist\\" because he feels that the term is being exploited by theists and used as a straw man argument. He felt that the term implies a dogmatic set of beliefs and carries its own share of negative baggage. So, Carroll suggested that atheists might as well adopt the term \\"Brights\\" with all its negative connotations.  The only religion that Carroll found attractive after abandoning Catholicism, despite never following it, is Buddhism as taught by the Dalai Lama.  Carroll has always maintained the opinion that people have to be more skeptical of religion than they are now. He said in multiple interviews that religion is an area that skeptics don't target enough, and that pure faith is winning the race against critical thinking.  Carroll tended to have a moderate outlook on religion. He believed that religion has a role to play in people's lives and he didn't condemn religion for terrorism. When asked about the relationship between violence and religion he said that he can't recall anything negative about his religious upbringing, and that maybe Catholicism can provide more good than harm. He didn't believe religion causes wars, he rather believed that it serves as an excuse for people who will go to war regardless of religion's existence. Carroll believed that some people rely on religion as their only source of morality and as a source of comfort. However, he found it distressing that some people are unable to find meaning in their lives without religion. In an interview with Beyond a Doubt he said  \\"There is nothing dull about a life without fairies, Easter bunnies, devils, ghosts, magic crystals, etc. Life is only boring to boring people.\\" Question: How did he feel about buddhism?.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six.  - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 .  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.    What is the relationship between 'tyler hamilton ' and 'canada'? Answer:","output":"Tyler Hamilton is a Canadian pop singer who gained fame from participating in a reality television show called \\"Canadian Idol.\\" He competed in the first season of the show and placed seventh.

The tweet discusses a few different events that the author seems to have enjoyed or is looking forward to. There might also be hints of a neutral sentiment in some parts of the tweet. Here's a breakdown of the individual sentiments present within the tweet: 1. \\"Long day at Morton's Poker Tourney\\" – This statement can be considered slightly neutral, as it mentions that the day was long, which could imply fatigue or potentially a tiring experience. However, it is important to consider the context of the events being described to gauge the sentiment accurately. 2. \\"lots of  raised for great cause\\" – This phrase implies a strong positive sentiment. The author highlights the fact that a significant amount of money was raised for a \\"great cause\\", which seems to be a source of satisfaction and joy for the person posting the tweet. 3. \\"Getting ready for Tiesto\\" – This statement conveys anticipation and excitement, as the author is getting ready for an event featuring the popular DJ Tiesto. The sentiment associated with it can be considered positive. 4. \\"then Hair Games Finale at Barcode!\\" – Similarly, the mention of attending the Hair Games Finale at Barcode implies a positive sentiment, as the exclamation mark indicates eagerness or enthusiasm for the upcoming event. In summary, the overall sentiment of the tweet is positively skewed, with the author likely expressing satisfaction from participating in a successful fundraising event and looking forward to attending enjoyable, entertainment-based events.

To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.  But I can use this background: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...  What is an answer for this question: Would case B show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case A? Answer:","output":"Case B would likely show less developed pheromone chemical signals than case A.

Article: It was a cold night in Washington, D. C., and I was heading back to the hotel when a man approached me. He asked if l would give him some money so he could get something to eat. I'd read the signs \\"Don't give money to beggars.\\" So I shook my head and kept walking. I wasn't prepared for a reply, but he said, \\"I really am homeless and I really am hungry! You can come with me and watch me eat!\\" But I kept on walking. The incident bothered me for the rest of the week. I had money in my pocket and it wouldn't have killed me to hand over a buck or two even if he had been lying. Flying back to Anchorage, I couldn't help thinking of him. I tried to rationalize  my failure to help by thinking government agencies, churches and charities were there to feed him. Besides, you're not supposed to give money to beggars. Somewhere over Seattle, I started to write my weekly garden column for The Anchorage Daily News. _ , I came up with an idea. Bean's Cafe, the soup kitchen in Anchorage, feeds hundreds of hungry Alaskans every day. Why not try to get all my readers to plant one row in their gardens dedicated to Bean's? Dedicate a row and take it down to Bean's. Clean and simple. The idea began to take off. Readers would fax or call me when they got something in their garden. Those who only grew flowers donated them. Food for the spirit. In 1995, the Garden Writers Association of America held their annual convention in Anchorage and after learning of Anchorage's program, Plant a Row for Bean's became Plant a Row for the Hungry. The original idea was to have every member of the Garden Writers Association of America write or talk about planting a row for the hungry sometime during the month of April. As more and more people started working with the Plant a Row idea, new changes appeared unexpectedly. Many companies gave free seed to customers and displayed the logo, which also appeared in national gardening publications.

Instead, the idea came to the author while writing his garden column on a flight back to Anchorage after reflecting on the beggar incident and thinking about the support systems that were supposed to help the homeless and hungry. The Plant a Row program was inspired by the author's desire to do something to help people in need, and it evolved into a nationwide campaign with the involvement of the Garden Writers Association of America and various gardening companies and publications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Monday night's grand jury decision to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, led to riots in the Missouri city. Although Michael Brown's family, President Barack Obama, and authorities called for peaceful protests, the Ferguson was soon out of control. The riots saw a return to the looting, fires and property damages which took place on a smaller scale in August, immediately after the shooting of Brown. Scroll down for video. Damage done: Two buildings still smoulder after the riots that ravaged Ferguson, Missouri overnight. Before: A satellite image taken by Google in September 2012 show the buildings intact. As the sun rose on Tuesday, the cityscape of Ferguson looked worlds away from satellite and Google Street View snaps taken just months earlier. Pictures from yesterday in comparison with images from before, tracked down byThe Wall Street Journal, show the damage done. Last night, tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, among others - were demonstrating against the long-awaited verdict. However, despite the St. Louis grand jury decision, federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue the US Attorney General said on Monday. The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead  unarmed Brown in August this year, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force. Beauty lost: A beauty supply store has been left in ruins after Monday night's riots. True beauty: A Google Street View snap from 2010 shows the shop in its original state. Burned out: A building in Ferguson only has its four walls left after being destroyed by fire. Better times: The building, which appears to be a shop, is pictured on Google earlier this year. The fire at the local Little Ceasars restaurant left the big orange sign in a melted lump on the ground. Neighborhood joint: There is no sign of its former glory, captured by Google in August 2012. Distraught: The manager of the Little Caesar's said he understood the protesters were angry but added: 'Speaking your mind - that’s America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point. But this...' More destruction: The arson frenzy also hit South Florissant Street, about a mile away. This branch of Little Casear's was burned out. Et tu: The neighboring antique shop to the Little Caesar's was also destroyed in the orgy of violence which hit Ferguson. Long way back: A woman stops to take a picture using her phone of the damage done. Still intact: The local Clean World Laundromat was still standing on Monday morning. Residents on the streets told MailOnline that the wreckage to Ferguson was so bad that it looked like ‘Ferganistan’. Another said that it ‘looked like Iraq’. Almost every building along South Florissant Street, where the Ferguson police station is located, had been ransacked or vandalised. Tony Koenig and his brother Ray, 38 and 40, had taken the day off from working as school groundskeepers to help rebuild a Mexican restaurant run by a friend. Tony said: ‘I have lived in Ferguson for 38 years and I have never seen anything like this. They just want street justice and they don’t care about how they get it. ‘This young generation. I cannot understand why they do what they do. The parents are to blame. When me and my brother grew up both our parents worked and we were raised knowing how to show respect, and that doesn’t happen these days. ‘We’ve had a hard enough time paying our mortgages after the economy went down. We don’t need this’. Their friend Drew Canaday, who was also helping them, lives in the street next to South Florissant and said that it was ‘like a war’ the night before. Destruction: :A rioter uses a stick to break a window at the Hunan Chop Suey Chinese Restaurant along West Florissant Ave last night. Nothing left: This was all that was left of the Hunan Chop Suey Chinese restaurant this morning after the fire wrecked it. Picture: 'I don't condone this but I can understand it. I have been racially profiled myself,' said Jason Westbrook of Ferguson as he took video of the burning of the Title Max Loans business on West Florissant. As they were: The Hunan Chop Suey and TitleMax loans were both intact before last night's orgy of violence. Burning: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree. Burned out: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree. Inspection: The scale of destruction became clear today after a night which saw fires raised across the St Louis suburb of Ferguson. Attacked: McDonald's on West Florissant was smashed up although not set on fire. It had previously (right) avoided damage. Devastated: A gas station was among the targets of the violence. Today property manager Terri Willits witnessed the destruction. Crime scene: Much of West Florissant was under police guard today and described by officers as an active crime scene. He said: ‘These young people are so used to instant gratification, they want stuff now. They are too immature to understand that stuff takes time. ‘Especially something this big. It takes dialogue and not everyone will be happy but that’s compromise. ‘These people don’t want to wait. That what today’s society has come to, not just here in Ferguson - this is America, this is the world.’ Further up South Florissant a Little Caesar’s pizza restaurant had been burned to the ground, as had the antiques store next to it. The manager of the restaurant, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals, said that 12 people had now been put out of work and did not know if the owners would rebuild. The manager said that the store was destroyed by a tornado three years earlier and they did build it back but it cost ‘a lot of money’. He said: ‘Most of the people here have families and they are very worried about what will come next for them. ‘I’m proud to work here and started as the dishwasher and worked my way up. I had a motorcycle accident and had my foot amputated and they were good enough to give me a job,. The manger, a widower with two children in their 20s, said that he was in principle on the side of the protesters but that this was ‘too far’. He said: ‘I believe in their right to protest and what they’re doing is a just case. ‘Speaking your mind - that’s America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point.

First, let's write down the equation:     -294 * o = -310 * o - 606 - 676 + 322 2. Now, let's add the numbers that aren't multiplied by o together:    -606 - 676 + 322 = -960 So, our equation becomes:    -294 * o = -310 * o - 960 3. Now, let's move the terms with o to one side by adding 310 * o to both sides:    (-294 * o) + (310 * o) = (-310 * o + 310 * o) - 960 After adding, we get:    16 * o = -960 4. Finally, we'll divide both sides by 16 to find the value of o:    (16 * o) / 16 = -960 / 16    o = -60 So, o has a value of -60."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the front of the frame is found the head tube that holds the pivoting front fork, while at the rear there is a pivot point for the swingarm. Some motorcycles include the engine as a load-bearing stressed member; while some others bikes do not use a single frame, but instead have a front and a rear subframe attached to the engine.  - The International Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) Race is a motorcycle sport event held annually on the Isle of Man in May or June of each year since the inaugural race in 1907. The Isle of Man TT for many years was the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world and also seen as the ultimate test for competitors and machines alike.

To provide a more detailed and informative answer, let's explore various subjects and topics that Ashkenazi Jews study outside the Yeshiva. Outside the Yeshiva framework, Ashkenazi Jews engage in studies that span across various subjects, both religious and secular. Here are some topics that are commonly studied: 1. Jewish Philosophy: Many Ashkenazi Jews study Jewish philosophy, which deals with questions concerning the nature of God, the purpose of life, and the relationship between God and the world. Essential works in Jewish philosophy include those of Maimonides, a prominent Jewish philosopher of the Middle Ages, as well as contemporary Jewish philosophers like Yeshayahu Leibowitz and Emmanuel Levinas. 2. Jewish History: Some Ashkenazi Jews study Jewish history, which traces the Jewish people's experiences through time both religiously and culturally. This subject covers historical periods that include the biblical era, the Second Temple period, the Jewish diaspora, and modern Jewish history. 3. Hebrew Language: The study of the Hebrew language, both classical and modern, is essential to understanding Jewish religious texts and cultural works. Ashkenazi Jews often engage in learning Hebrew to strengthen their connection to Jewish traditions and enhance their prayer experiences. It also allows them to communicate with Israeli Jews and understand Israeli literature, film, and music. 4. Jewish Literature: Ashkenazi Jews study Jewish literature, which encompasses a myriad of literary works produced by Jewish authors throughout history. This may include religious texts, poetry, novels, and short stories that reflect Jewish culture, themes, and values. 5. Jewish Arts and Culture: Many Ashkenazi Jews delve into various aspects of Jewish arts and culture, including visual arts, music, theater, and film. These cultural expressions provide insights into Jewish history and experience and reveal how Jewish values are communicated through artistic mediums. 6. Jewish Law (Halakhah): Although Yeshiva education focuses mainly on Jewish law, some Ashkenazi Jews may continue studying halakhic texts and traditions outside the formal Yeshiva setting. 7. Secular Studies: Ashkenazi Jews also engage in secular studies, which may include subjects such as science, technology, engineering, math, humanities, and social sciences. Some attend secular universities and pursue careers in various professional fields. In conclusion, Ashkenazi Jews study a wide array of topics outside the Yeshiva framework, which extend beyond religious subjects to encompass secular studies and cultural interests.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. joints become inflammed and painful Please fix the punctuation.","output":"Joints become inflamed and painful. It is a common issue that many people experience, and it can have a significant impact on their daily lives. Inflammation and pain in joints can be caused by various factors, including injury, overuse, autoimmune diseases, and age-related changes. Below is a detailed explanation of why joints become inflamed and painful, as well as potential ways to alleviate the symptoms. 1. Injury: Injuries to the joints can range from minor sprains, strains, or tendonitis to more severe cases like dislocations, fractures, or ligament tears. When an injury occurs, the body's natural response is to release chemicals that cause inflammation and swelling. This is a crucial step in the healing process, but the inflammation itself can be painful. 2. Overuse: When joints are subjected to repetitive movements or excessive strain over time, the structures surrounding the joint, such as the cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, can become irritated, leading to inflammation and pain. This is commonly seen in athletes who participate in high-impact activities, like running or jumping, or in individuals who engage in heavy physical labor for their occupation. 3. Autoimmune diseases: Autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and lupus, can also cause joint pain and inflammation. In these disorders, the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, leading to inflammation in the affected areas. This immune response can directly damage the synovial membrane and other joint structures, causing pain, swelling, and stiffness. 4. Age-related changes: Over time, the cartilage that cushions the joints can wear down due to aging and everyday wear-and-tear. When the cartilage breaks down, the bones in the joint start to rub against each other, causing friction, inflammation, and pain. This degenerative process is commonly seen in osteoarthritis, which is the most prevalent form of arthritis. To help alleviate joint pain and inflammation, consider the following: 1. Rest: Giving the affected joint adequate rest will help minimize further strain and prevent worsening of the symptoms. Elevating the joint can also help reduce swelling. 2. Ice and heat therapy: Applying ice packs to the affected joint can help reduce inflammation and numb the area, providing pain relief. On the other hand, heat therapy, such as warm compresses or heating pads, can help relax the muscles and improve blood circulation in the area, promoting healing. 3. Medications: Over-the-counter medications, like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or pain relievers like acetaminophen, can help alleviate joint pain and inflammation. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before starting any medication regimen. 4. Physical therapy: A physical therapist can design personalized exercise programs to help maintain or improve your joint flexibility, strength, and range of motion while reducing pain and inflammation. 5. Lifestyle modifications: Maintaining a healthy weight and incorporating low-impact exercises, like swimming or cycling, can help reduce stress on the joints, lessening pain and inflammation. 6. Alternative therapies: Some individuals find relief from joint pain and inflammation through alternative therapies like acupuncture, massage therapy or chiropractic care. However, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider before trying any alternative treatment. In conclusion, joint inflammation and pain can severely impact an individual's life. Recognizing the underlying cause, whether it's due to injury, overuse, autoimmune disease, or age-related changes, is vital for identifying the appropriate treatment to help alleviate symptoms and improve the person's quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a sub-branch of the Turkic language family. The Turkic language family is one of the largest language families in the world and includes languages like Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, and Kazakh among others. Turkish is an agglutinative language - which means most words are formed by adding suffixes to base words - and its grammar is largely based on suffixation and infixation. The Turkish language has a rich array of vocabulary, much of which is derived from Persian and Arabic, though modern Turkish also borrows from French and English. Turkish uses the Latin script as its writing system, but it was written with the Arabic script before 1928.  Modern Turkish rose during the period known as the Tanzimat era of the Ottoman Empire (around 1839-1876). In the early 20th century Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, initiated a language reform to replace many of the Arabic and Persian words with Turkish equivalents, and to use the Latin script instead of Arabic script. This was done in order to make the language easier to read and write and to foster a stronger national identity. The result of this reform is the modern Turkish language spoken today. Turkish is a unique and fascinating language, offering interesting insights not only linguistically, but also historically and culturally, due to Turkey's position straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, acting as a bridge between Western and Eastern cultures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Who did Seleucus invade?\\"  Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Seleucus invaded the territories of Lysimachus in Asia Minor. In the given context, following the death of Cassander in 298 BCE, Demetrius managed to seize the Macedonian throne and conquer Thessaly and central Greece. However, his reign was short-lived when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon in 288 BCE, dividing the kingdom between themselves. Demetrius later shifted his focus to central Greece, the northern Peloponnese, and eventually Asia Minor, waging war on Lysimachus' territories in Ionia. Despite Demetrius' initial successes, he was eventually forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 BCE and subsequently died in captivity. Seizing the opportunity, Seleucus invaded Lysimachus' territories in Asia Minor, resulting in Lysimachus' defeat and death in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium near Sardis. Seleucus then set his sights on Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, expanding his empire further. However, Seleucus' ambitious plans were thwarted when he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who then declared himself king of Macedon. Ptolemy's reign was also temporary, as the Gauls invaded Macedon in 279, leading to his death and the descent of the region into chaos. Antigonus II Gonatas eventually emerged as the new king of Macedon, successfully invading Thrace in 277 and defeating a large force of Gauls. In summary, Seleucus invaded the territories of Lysimachus in Asia Minor following Demetrius' surrender and Lysimachus' subsequent defeat at the Battle of Corupedium. This action not only resulted in the expansion of the Seleucid Empire but also set the stage for a series of conflicts and power struggles in the region over the following years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now I will analyze the options given. Option A: Yes This option would mean that the person's presence is needed or useful in the situation, and there is a specific reason or condition for them to be there. Option B: It is not possible to tell This option would mean that it is unclear whether or not their presence is needed or useful, and/or if there is any specific reason for them to be there. Option C: No This response would mean that the person's presence is not needed or useful in the situation, and there is no specific reason or condition for them to be there.

Chapter VII.  MAGGIE IS VERY NAUGHTY.  As soon as the children reached the open air Tom said, \\"Here, Lucy, you come along with me,\\" and walked off to the place where the toads were, as if there were no Maggie in existence. Lucy was naturally pleased that Cousin Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string, when the toad was safe down the area, with an iron grating over him.  Still Lucy wished Maggie to enjoy the sight also, especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad, and say what had been his past history; for Lucy loved Maggie's stories about the live things they came upon by accident--how Mrs. Earwig had a wash at home, and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper, for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor. So now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad made her run back to Maggie and say, \\"Oh, there is such a big, funny toad, Maggie! Do come and see.\\"  Maggie said nothing, but turned away from her with a deep frown. She was actually beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry, by slapping or pinching her, especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if she dared, because he didn't mind it. And if Lucy hadn't been there, Maggie was sure he would have made friends with her sooner.  Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Did Lucy like Maggie's stories? 2.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who spent virtually his entire life in Paris? from the following article ?  Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Charlie is stopped with the wheels turned left, waiting for a lull in the traffic so he can turn left, when a car rear-ends him, sending him into the left lane, where an 18-wheeler then crashes into the passenger side of the car. Charlie becomes the caretaker of the cemetery - not an undertaker. When Tess is \\"in between,\\" she notices that she can't see her reflection in a window (not the water.) When Charlie doesn't make it back to the cemetery by sunset, because he is looking for Tess and her boat, Sam goes into the light. After Tess's boat flips over, she is not hanging upside down. Charlie finds her lying on nearby rocks. Tess recovers from the boat accident and goes home, before Charlie is let out of the hospital. Charlie doesn't become a paramedic. Charlie goes to the woods by the cemetery to say goodbye to Sam before he and Tess sail around the world. He can no longer see Sam. It's not clear if he can hear him or not. Sam is not upset that Charlie didn't make it back that other night. He says it was time, that crossing over is better than he could have imagined.Charlie St. Cloud (age 15) and Sam (12) are two brothers with a love so strong, no force can separate them. When their mom leaves Charlie to babysit Sam, they decide to go to watch a 1991 Red Sox baseball game in Boston against the New York Yankees with their pet beagle, Oscar. They \\"borrow\\" their neighbor Mrs. Pung's Ford Country Squire. On the way there they cannot decide which CD to listen to. As they cross the General Edwards...

Dr. Raymond Cocteau, a genius, charismatic visionary and idealistic scientist, runs the city as its unopposed ruler. Through his powerful corporation, Cocteau Industries, he has successfully managed to eliminate crime, poverty, and pollution by using advanced technology that puts inhabitants under constant surveillance and control. The city, seemingly free from suffering and chaos, is hailed as a futuristic utopia. Dr. Cocteau has become an icon, with his face displayed on holographic billboards and his voice streamed through every corner of the city. However, not everyone is content with Cocteau's rule. On the outskirts of San Angeles, a group of rebels, led by the charismatic and resourceful Morgan Blake, refuse to conform to Cocteau's vision of utopia and seek a world with genuine elements of freedom and individuality. Meanwhile, Luke Jennings, a private investigator who discovered Cocteau's darkest secret - a series of highly classified human experiments in an attempt to create a 'perfect' human - unwittingly finds himself caught up in the city's political struggle. Luke joins forces with Morgan and the rebels to expose the truth behind San Angeles and bring Cocteau's corrupt regime to an end. To prevent the truth from coming out, Dr. Cocteau unleashes his highly advanced security forces led by his top enforcer, Cyrus. As the rebels get closer to the hidden laboratory containing the evidence they need, Cyrus and his team hunt them down ruthlessly. As the movie heads towards an intense climax, Luke and Morgan succeed in infiltrating the laboratory and uncover disturbing test subjects who are part human and part machine. During the final battle, the rebels manage to broadcast Cocteau's dark secret to the entire city, causing the citizens to revolt against Cocteau's control. The film concludes with Dr. Cocteau being captured and arrested for his crimes, with his previous loyal followers realizing the shocking truth. San Angeles is now liberated from oppression, and the people begin the long journey of rebuilding their society on a foundation of regained freedom and self-determination. \\"San Angeles Utopia\\" is an engaging and fast-paced movie with themes focusing on the human spirit, the quest for freedom, and the consequences of playing \\"God\\".

A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. If fewer larvae grow, it means that there will be fewer individuals entering the chrysalis stage. Consequently, fewer butterflies will exit the chrysalis, as there will be fewer pupae transforming into adult butterflies.

Write a title for this article: BY Peter Botte DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER Sunday, January 30th 2011, 4:00 AM Jorge PosadaÂ tried to play the good soldier in his first public comments this winter. He said Saturday night that his switch from behind the plate to full-time DH in 2011 \\"is what it is,\\" while also playing the \\"whatever's best for the team\\" card. But the Yankees' longtime backstop also admitted later that he's keeping his mitt broken in \\"just in case,\\" indicating he hasn't fully come to terms with being phased out of the position he's owned since the late '90s. \\"I'll catch. I'll catch. I'll catch this year,\\" Posada said before Bernie Williams' charity dinner for the Hillside Food Outreach in New Rochelle. \\"I'll DH and then they're going to want me to catch one of those days. I'm keeping an open mind. I would love to catch. I'm training like I always do, and if I have to catch, I'll catch.\\" Posada was responding to GM Brian Cashman, who earlier this week said Posada shouldn't expect to be anything more than the Yanks' full-time designated hitter and their \\"emergency catcher\\" in 2011. Cashman met with Posada - who Saturday night claimed his surgically repaired left knee is 100% - in November to inform him of the career change. The Yanks then added former Dodgers backstop Russell Martin to share catching duties with either Francisco Cervelli or rookies Jesus Montero and Austin Romine. \\"I can't complain. I always like to catch, I'm used to catching, but if they want me to DH to help out the team, you have to do that,\\" Posada said. \\"It is what it is. I look forward to everything I do. I try to help out the team, and if that's going to help out the team and that's what they want, I'm OK with it.\\" Posada, 39, also said the transition probably is \\"going to be toughest during the season,\\" especially the mental adjustment to remain involved in the game without playing defensively. \\"When you're a catcher and try to catch, but you can't and you try to DH, it's tough, it's a struggle,\\" Posada said. \\"But going into a season and knowing you're going to be a DH, I have to look for a routine. It's not easy to be a DH. I have to find a nice little routine that I can get used to and have a good season.\\" Still, he also acknowledged that such a move probably means he \\"won't be as beat up\\" from the usual wear and tear of catching duties. After batting just .248 with 18 homers and 57 RBI in 451 plate appearances during an injury-plagued 2010, he is entering the final season of a four-year, 52 million contract. \\"I would like to keep my doors open, I would like if I feel good and feel like I can do it and having fun, I would like to keep going,\\" Posada said. \\"I love playing the game. I just hope that everything stays healthy.\\" The Yankees' handling of Posada is part of an offseason in which they also engaged in contentious contract relations with Derek Jeter while preparing for the possibility that Andy Pettitte might not return for a 17th season. Posada said he's talked and texted often with Pettitte, before adding, \\"I haven't asked him anything about baseball. I just want him to make the decision. ...Whatever it is, honestly, we're going to support it. Andy is a very valuable guy for us. If he wants to be home, obviously he has the reasons to be home, but we need him.\\" Even if Posada and other members of the old guard won't be needed in their accustomed roles forever. \\"We're getting old,\\" Posada joked. \\"It's tough, it's a business. We have to keep performing, keep doing well, so the decisions are tougher. But we understand it.\\"","output":"Title: Navigating Change: Jorge Posada's Transition from Catcher to Designated Hitter and the Yankees' Evolving Dynamics"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.  Question: \\"Where and when did she move to in America?\\" Answer: \\"1916\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct.

Given the question: This article: By the early 20th century, major river-control projects had begun to take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail—expanded to 217 miles (349 km) to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of national water trails. The water-trail system is meant to protect and restore waterways in the United States and to enhance recreation on and near them.A 1991 agreement between the City of... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that named the river that had cleanup efforts begin in the 1930s get a American Heritage River?, what is it ?

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.  Question: \\"The main country that influenced Japan in the region\\" Answer: \\"Hong Kong\\" Is this answer correct?   -no  -yes...I think the answer is","output":"No. The correct answer is \\"China.\\" In the text, it is mentioned that Chinese Buddhism was introduced to Japan, and Japanese monks, scholars, and artists traveled to China to study their religion, history, music, literature, and painting. Also, through Prince Shotoku, the Japanese imperial court adopted Chinese patterns of centralized government and used the Chinese calendar. These examples show that China was the main country that influenced Japan in the region. Hong Kong is incorrect because it is not mentioned in the text as having any influence on Japan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A perennial loser for years, the team's manager Joe McGrath (Strother Martin) has resorted to extreme cost-cutting techniques and embarrassing promotional antics to keep local interest alive. Dunlop, while not particularly talented as either a player or coach, is a skilled con man, and regularly manipulates the team to his own advantage. During a hopeless season, the Chiefs pick up the Hanson Brothers, bespectacled violent goons with childlike mentalities, complete with toys in their luggage. Horrified at being given players who seem stupid, immature, and unreliable, Dunlop initially chooses not to play them. When it is announced that the local mill will be closing and 10,000 workers will be unemployed, Dunlop grows concerned about the team's future. He makes several attempts to learn the identity of the team's anonymous owner (a running gag throughout the film), but is deftly deflected by McGrath each time. When McGrath accompanies them on an away game, top scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) overhears him attempting to get a job with another team. After Braden relays this information to his teammates, Dunlop confronts McGrath, who confirms that the Chiefs will fold at the end of the season. Determined to save the team at all costs, Dunlop starts provoking fights at games to secure goals and the Chiefs start to win games. In a moment of desperation, he lets the Hansons play and discovers that their aggressive fighting style enthralls the fans. He begins retooling the team as a goon squad in the Hansons' image and attendance quickly increases. Capitalizing on this growing interest, he plants a false story with eccentric sports news writer Dickie Dunn (M.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Van Cortlandt Park is located in the Bronx, a borough of New York City. The park covers more than 1,146 acres of land, making it the third-largest park in the city. It is bordered by Yonkers to the north, the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) and Kingsbridge to the east, Jerome Park Reservoir to the southeast, Broadway and Riverdale to the west, and the Mosholu Parkway to the south. The Grand Concourse, a wide boulevard, does pass through certain areas of the park but is mainly located on the eastern side of the park, running north to south. Van Cortlandt Park has a rich history dating back to the 17th century when it was first occupied by the native Lenape people and later by the Dutch settlers. It was named after the Van Cortlandt family, who owned the land during the colonial period. The park was officially established in 1888, after the land was acquired by the government. The park features various attractions, including sports fields, playgrounds, walking trails, horseback riding, and one of the oldest public golf courses in the United States, the Van Cortlandt Park Golf Course. In addition, the park is home to several historic sites, such as the Van Cortlandt House Museum (built in 1748), the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail, and the Bronx's highest point, Vault Hill. Visitors to Van Cortlandt Park can enjoy a wide array of recreational activities, including baseball, soccer, cricket, cross-country running, tennis, and swimming in the public pool. Nature lovers can explore the park's extensive network of hiking trails, the 188-acre Van Cortlandt Lake, and the park's forests, which are home to a diverse range of plants and wildlife. The park is well-connected to various public transportation options, including subway lines 1 and 4, multiple bus routes, as well as the Metro-North Hudson Line, making it easily accessible to New York City residents and visitors alike."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: what type of car was christine in the movie?","output":"Christine, the titular car in the 1983 movie based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, is a 1958 Plymouth Fury. This classic American car became popular due to the film's portrayal of it as a sentient, evil vehicle that possesses the ability to repair itself and exert control over its owner. The 1958 Plymouth Fury was developed by Plymouth, a division of the Chrysler Corporation, and belonged to the third generation of the Fury model line (1955-1958). It was a two-door hardtop and came with a range of engine options, including a 318 cu in (5.2L) V8, a 350 cu in (5.7L) V8, or a highly sought-after 361 cu in (5.9L) V8 with dual 4-barrel carburetors, known as the \\"Golden Commando\\" engine, which provided high performance for the time. The Fury was available in a unique color for that year called \\"Buckskin Beige,\\" featuring gold anodized aluminum inserts on the side panels, and the interior was also finished in tan and beige tones with gold trim accents. In the movie, Christine is portrayed as having unique powers, haunting her owner and causing destruction to those who seek to damage or harm her. Despite the Fury being available only in Buckskin Beige in real life, Christine was depicted in the film as a fiery red and white automobile. It is important to note that several 1957 and 1958 Plymouth Belvedere and Savoy models were also used as stunt and stand-in cars during the filming of the movie, since the real Fury was a rare and expensive model, and the production team was not able to procure enough for filming purposes. These models were modified to closely resemble the 1958 Plymouth Fury."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

We want to find the value of 'f'. Step 1: Let's try to get all 'f' things on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 15*f to both sides: -25*f + 15*f - 20 = -15*f + 15*f Now, simplify: -10 * f - 20 = 0 Step 2: Now, let's try to isolate 'f' by getting rid of the -20. We'll add 20 to both sides: -10 * f - 20 + 20 = 0 + 20 Simplify: -10 * f = 20 Step 3: Lastly, we need to find the value of 'f'. Now, we'll divide both sides by -10: (-10 * f) / -10 = 20 / -10 Now, simplify: f = -2 So, f = -2 is the solution to our math problem!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer: Is \\"Together the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian language.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Which dialect became the norm for the modern Italian language?\\" Available choices:  1). yes  2). no","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Together the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian language.\\" is a good answer to the question \\"Which dialect became the norm for the modern Italian language?\\" However, it would be beneficial to provide additional context and information to explain why and how this development occurred. The Tuscan dialect, which originated in the Tuscany region of Italy, is considered the most prestigious Italian dialect, primarily due to the works of key historical figures in Italian literature. These three poets are Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch), and Giovanni Boccaccio. Their influential works played a pivotal role in shaping the Italian language and elevating the status of the Tuscan dialect. Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) was a prominent Italian poet who wrote the Divine Comedy ('La Divina Commedia'), an epic poem divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. This masterpiece is considered one of the greatest works of world literature and was written in the Tuscan dialect, which helped the dialect gain prestige and widespread prominence. Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374), better known as Petrarch, was another influential Italian poet who significantly contributed to the establishment of the Tuscan dialect. He is renowned for his collection of 366 poems called 'Canzoniere' (Songbook) that covers various themes such as love, virtue, and emotions. Petrarch's use of the Tuscan dialect in his poetry further solidified the dialect's status in Italian literature. Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), the third significant poet of this period, wrote 'The Decameron,' a collection of 100 short tales encompassing various topics such as love, tragedy, and wit. Through his literary works in the Tuscan dialect, Boccaccio also contributed to its recognition and acceptance as a standard for the written Italian language. In conclusion, the Tuscan dialect became the norm for the modern Italian language due to the combined efforts of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio. Their groundbreaking literary works immortalized the Tuscan dialect, which eventually led to its adoption as the prestigious and standard written form of the Italian language."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seniors will receive their stimulus payments the same way they receive their Social Security funds. Tens of millions of Social Security recipients will see their bank accounts jump by 250 starting Thursday, when the government began sending out checks and transferring funds for a one-time boost coming from the stimulus bill passed in February. The payments are flowing to nearly 55 million seniors and retirees between now and June 4, with a huge batch of checks hitting the mail this week. \\"Approximately half of them will be out in the next day or two,\\" Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue told CNN Thursday. The money will arrive in the same way that each person receives regular Social Security or Supplemental Security Income funds. If a person receives a Social Security check in the mail, the 250 stimulus payment will also appear in his or her mailbox. An increasing number of people use direct deposit, so many seniors and SSI recipients could see the 250 boost in their accounts immediately. Social Security and SSI recipients make up the largest groups to get the stimulus money, but it will also go out to railroad retirees and disabled veterans. Agencies serving those groups will release the funds separately. All told, the government estimates some 64 million Americans will receive the one-time stimulus checks this year, at a cost of 13 billion to the federal budget. This comes as the Obama administration continues a public relations push to show that the 787 billion stimulus act is warming up the economy. Astrue noted that these 250 payments are going out weeks before the deadline and are, by far, the largest single stimulus payment to individual Americans. \\"This is a point in time where some of the first big chunks of stimulus money is actually going into the economy,\\" Astrue said. Meanwhile, there is vigorous debate over how stimulus payments will be spent in tough times. Will the checks do anything for the overall economy? Astrue's agency has asked seniors to e-mail and tell what they plan to do with the 250. He admits that some have said they expect to save the money or pay off debts, but he insists that many responses listed hands-on spending. \\"We get people who say they'll buy paint, we get people who say they'll buy furniture,\\" he said. \\"Quite a few of our recipients say they'll buy clothes or school supplies for their grandkids.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The U.S. government began sending out 250 stimulus payments to nearly 55 million seniors, retirees, and struggling Social Security recipients starting Thursday.

The payments will be delivered in the same manner as regular Social Security or Supplemental Security Income funds, either through mail or direct deposit. In addition to Social Security and SSI recipients, railroad retirees and disabled veterans will also receive these stimulus checks. In total, around 64 million Americans will receive these payments, costing the federal budget 13 billion.

Here is a hypothesis: Long cables were tied around huge slabs of rock. Here are the options: Choices: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"If the premise is true, then it is indeed possible that the hypothesis is also true. Let us examine the premise and hypothesis in detail to understand if both statements are interconnected and whether the hypothesis can be concluded from the given premise. Premise: Long ropes were looped around enormous slabs of quarried rock. The premise states that there are long ropes. These ropes are used to form loops around enormous slabs of quarried rock. It means that the ropes are used to manage, move, or secure the large rocks that were mined from a quarry. Hypothesis: Long cables were tied around huge slabs of rock. The hypothesis proposes that long cables were used. These cables are tied around huge slabs of rock. Like the premise, it suggests that the cables were used to manage, move, or secure large rocks, but it does not specify the origin of the rocks (whether they are from a quarry or not). Now let's compare the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Ropes vs. Cables: In the premise, ropes are used, while in the hypothesis, cables are used. Ropes are generally made from fibers, while cables can be made from either metal or fibers. It is important to note that cables are usually stronger and more durable than ropes. However, both can serve a similar purpose in handling heavy loads. 2. Enormous vs. Huge: Both adjectives imply that the size of the rocks is large. Additionally, these words are subjective and could vary in interpretation. Therefore, we could consider both adjectives to describe similar-sized rocks. 3. Quarried vs. Not specified: The premise explicitly mentions that the rocks are quarried, while the hypothesis does not specify the origin of the rocks. It is possible that the rocks in the hypothesis come from a quarry, but it's not confirmed in the statement. Despite these differences, the premise's core idea coincides with the hypothesis—using a long, flexible material to manage, move, or secure substantial slabs of rock. While the type of material used (rope or cable) and the origin of the rocks slightly differ, the purpose and context remain similar. Considering the similarities and connections between the premise and the hypothesis, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. While they are not identical statements, the truth of the premise supports the plausibility and allows the hypothesis's core idea to be true as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is Canto del Maggio? The answer is:","output":"Canto del Maggio is a charming Bed & Breakfast, restaurant, and garden establishment located about an hour's drive from Florence, Italy.

Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today. However, the economic significance of the caste system in India has been declining as a result of urbanization and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Indian caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India. The term is also applied to non-human populations like ants and bees.  - The Pasi are one of the untouchable communities ( or dalits ) who are now classified as a Scheduled Caste under modern India 's system of positive discrimination . As untouchables , they were traditionally considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system of castes known as varna . They live in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh .  - Social stratification is a society's categorization of people into socioeconomic strata, based upon their occupation and income, wealth and social status, or derived power (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit. In modern Western societies, social stratification typically is distinguished as three social classes: (i) the upper class, (ii) the middle class, and (iii) the lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into strata, e.g. the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum. Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship or caste, or both.  - The caste system in India is the paradigmatic ethnographic example of caste. It has origins in ancient India, and was transformed by various ruling elites in medieval, early-modern, and, modern India, especially the Mughal Empire and the British Raj. It is today the basis of educational and job reservations in India. It consists of two different concepts, \\"varna\\" and \\"jti\\", which may be regarded as different levels of analysis of this system.  - Affirmative action (known as reservation in India and Nepal and positive discrimination in the UK; also known in a narrower context as employment equity in Canada and South Africa) is the policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer or have suffered from discrimination within a culture. Often, these people are disadvantaged for historical reasons, such as oppression or slavery. Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances. The nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region. Some countries, such as India, use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group. In some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man whose men are not allowed to arm themselves? ?  Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.  However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion.

Step 2: Reflect on the positions of the sun, moon, and Earth - In order for the moon to reflect sunlight towards Earth, it must be positioned between the sun and the Earth. - However, the moon orbits Earth, and these positions change constantly. Therefore, the moon is not always in the same position relative to the sun and Earth. Step 3: Consider the properties of the objects involved - The sun emits light, which is the source of the light that the moon reflects. - The moon does not emit light; it only reflects the sunlight that reaches it. - The Earth receives and is illuminated by the reflected sunlight from the moon. Step 4: Identify the relationship between the sun, moon, and Earth - The sun is the light source. - The moon serves as a reflective object which redirects sunlight towards Earth. - The Earth is the receiver of both direct sunlight and reflected sunlight from the moon. Based on these steps, the best description of the relationship between the moon, Earth, and the sun is: The sun, moon, and Earth have an interdependent relationship that involves sunlight emission, reflection, and reception. The sun emits light, the moon reflects this light towards Earth, and the Earth receives illumination from both direct sunlight and reflected sunlight from the moon. The positions of these celestial bodies in relation to one another change constantly due to the moon's orbit around Earth and the Earth's orbit around the sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The speaker wonders if the people involved had checked into the nursing homes before putting their loved one in it, acknowledging that it might be difficult to get a spot in such facilities. However, this premise does not provide any concrete information about the exact procedure or the waiting period required for securing a spot in a nursing home. Now, let's consider the hypothesis. It states that people have to book years in advance for spots in nursing homes. While it is true that nursing homes can be in high demand and may have long waiting lists, this hypothesis simplifies the situation by making a blanket statement about all nursing homes. It is crucial to note that waiting times for nursing homes can vary significantly depending on factors such as location, reputation, quality of care, and availability of resources. Some nursing homes may have shorter waiting lists, while others may require booking much further in advance. In conclusion, although there might be some correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, the connection between them is not concrete enough to confirm that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. To establish such a conclusion, more data and information about the specific nursing home and the possible factors that influenced the decision-making process in this case would be needed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.

(CNN) -- Bayern Munich look simply unstoppable and uncatchable in the Bundesliga as Eintracht Frankfurt were the latest team to be swept aside Sunday with a 5-0 rout re-opening a 13-point advantage at the top. It was Bayern's record 44th unbeaten game in the German championship and their third since returning from the midwinter break.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

(CNN) -- Relations between the Vatican and Ireland deteriorated sharply as the Holy See appeared to ignore a commission looking into complaints of physical and sexual abuse of children by Irish priests, according to U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. One cable from earlier this year says the Vatican was angered by the way the Murphy Commission -- which was looking into the how complaints of abuse had been handled by the Church and Irish government -- sidestepped normal diplomatic channels. The commission had written directly to the Vatican to seek information and requested a meeting with the Vatican's representative in Ireland. The Vatican envoy did not respond, according to the cable. \\"Adding insult to injury, Vatican officials also believed some OPTIONS: - CNN opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - Church opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - Holy See opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - Ireland opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - Irish opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - Murphy Commission opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - U.S. opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - Vatican opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" - WikiLeaks opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\"","output":"The correct option would be \\"Irish opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" The other options would not be relevant as they pertain to entities other than the political opposition in Ireland such as \\"CNN\\", \\"Holy See\\", \\"Murphy Commission\\", etc. These terms do not represent political entities or opposition parties in Ireland.  Also, given the context of the paragraph, it would be the Irish opposition politicians who would have a vested interest in challenging or criticizing their government's interactions with the Vatican especially on an issue as sensitive as child abuse by clergy. This political dynamic would further exacerbate tensions between the Vatican and Ireland, irking the Vatican that not only were the normal diplomatic channels being bypassed by the Murphy Commission but also that opposition politicians were capitalizing on the situation to score political points. Thus, the completion of the sentence which makes the most sense considering the geographical, political, and thematic context would be \\"Irish opposition politicians were making political hay with the situation by calling publicly on the government to demand that the Vatican reply.\\" Making \\"political hay\\" refers to the fact that these politicians were leveraging a difficult or challenging situation (in this case, the alleged lack of cooperation from the Vatican with an investigation into child abuse by priests) to advance their own political agendas or interests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Tomorrow morning the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will mark the winter solstice by taking an unprecedented step to expand government's reach into the Internet by attempting to regulate its inner workings. In doing so, the agency will circumvent Congress and disregard a recent court ruling. How did the FCC get here? For years, proponents of so-called \\"net neutrality\\" have been calling for strong regulation of broadband \\"on-ramps\\" to the Internet, like those provided by your local cable or phone companies. Rules are needed, the argument goes, to ensure that the Internet remains open and free, and to discourage broadband providers from thwarting consumer demand. That sounds good if you say it fast. Nothing is broken that needs fixing, however. The Internet has been open and freedom-enhancing since it was spun off from a government research project in the early 1990s. Its nature as a diffuse and dynamic global network of networks defies top-down authority. Ample laws to protect consumers already exist. Furthermore, the Obama Justice Department and the European Commission both decided this year that net-neutrality regulation was unnecessary and might deter investment in next-generation Internet technology and infrastructure. Analysts and broadband companies of all sizes have told the FCC that new rules are likely to have the perverse effect of inhibiting capital investment, deterring innovation, raising operating costs, and ultimately increasing consumer prices. Others maintain that the new rules will kill jobs. By moving forward with Internet rules anyway, the FCC is not living up to its promise of being \\"data driven\\" in its pursuit of mandates—i.e., listening to the needs of the market. It wasn't long ago that bipartisan and international consensus centered on insulating the Internet from regulation. This policy was a bright hallmark of the Clinton administration, which oversaw the Internet's privatization. Over time, however, the call for more Internet regulation became imbedded into a 2008 presidential campaign promise by then-Sen. Barack Obama. So here we are. Last year, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski started to fulfill this promise by proposing rules using a legal theory from an earlier commission decision (from which I had dissented in 2008) that was under court review. So confident were they in their case, FCC lawyers told the federal court of appeals in Washington, D.C., that their theory gave the agency the authority to regulate broadband rates, even though Congress has never given the FCC the power to regulate the Internet. FCC leaders seemed caught off guard by the extent of the court's April 6 rebuke of the commission's regulatory overreach. In May, the FCC leadership floated the idea of deeming complex and dynamic Internet services equivalent to old-fashioned monopoly phone services, thereby triggering price-and-terms regulations that originated in the 1880s. The announcement produced what has become a rare event in Washington: A large, bipartisan majority of Congress agreeing on something. More than 300 members of Congress, including 86 Democrats, contacted the FCC to implore it to stop pursuing Internet regulation and to defer to Capitol Hill. Facing a powerful congressional backlash, the FCC temporarily changed tack and convened negotiations over the summer with a select group of industry representatives and proponents of Internet regulation. Curiously, the commission abruptly dissolved the talks after Google and Verizon, former Internet-policy rivals, announced their own side agreement for a legislative blueprint. Yes, the effort to reach consensus was derailed by . . . consensus. After a long August silence, it appeared that the FCC would defer to Congress after all. Agency officials began working with House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman on a draft bill codifying network management rules. No Republican members endorsed the measure. Later, proponents abandoned the congressional effort to regulate the Net. Still feeling quixotic pressure to fight an imaginary problem, the FCC leadership this fall pushed a small group of hand-picked industry players toward a \\"choice\\" between a bad option (broad regulation already struck down in April by the D.C. federal appeals court) or a worse option (phone monopoly-style regulation). Experiencing more coercion than consensus or compromise, a smaller industry group on Dec. 1 gave qualified support for the bad option. The FCC's action will spark a billable-hours bonanza as lawyers litigate the meaning of \\"reasonable\\" network management for years to come. How's that for regulatory certainty? To date, the FCC hasn't ruled out increasing its power further by using the phone monopoly laws, directly or indirectly regulating rates someday, or expanding its reach deeper into mobile broadband services. The most expansive regulatory regimes frequently started out modest and innocuous before incrementally growing into heavy-handed behemoths. On this winter solstice, we will witness jaw-dropping interventionist chutzpah as the FCC bypasses branches of our government in the dogged pursuit of needless and harmful regulation. The darkest day of the year may end up marking the beginning of a long winter's night for Internet freedom. Mr. McDowell is a Republican commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the character who gives Wayne and Garth tickets to see Alice Cooper?, using the article: In Aurora, Illinois, rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a public-access television show, Wayne's World, from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for 10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his Cantonese. He purchases a 1964 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar he has long coveted. Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a music video for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records. While filming the revamped Wayne's World under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their sponsor, Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of amusement arcades. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust. Wayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. As he leaves, Cassandra changes her mind about Benjamin. Wayne apologizes and they return to Aurora., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"Benjamin Oliver. In the given article, it states that \\"He (Benjamin) distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a music video for Crucial Taunt.\\" This shows that Benjamin is the character who gives Wayne and Garth tickets to see Alice Cooper."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the article There I was outside a popular local bar with a friend on a Saturday night for a good conversation over the few drinks and our entry was denied . Well groomed , well dressed and with proper footwear yet our entry was denied and I was puzzled . when I asked them why and they slapped the door on my face and answered in two words \\" Only couples \\" .","output":"Based on the provided information from the article, several questions can be asked. Here are a few: 1. What are some of the key societal norms and expectations that might lead to a bar's policy of only allowing couples to enter?     This question asks the reader to think more deeply about the social context in which policies like \\"only couples\\" may arise. It invites reflection not only on bar policies, but also on broader social norms concerning public spaces and social interaction. It encourages the reader to consider how various societal expectations and conventions might lead to such rules, and to ask whether these rules are fair or unjust. 2. Can the 'Only couples' policy of the bar be viewed as discrimination and could it have legal implications in different jurisdictions?     This question examines the potential legal implications of the bar's policy. Although the rights and freedoms of private establishments to enforce admission policies can vary widely by jurisdiction, the fact that the author and their friend were denied entry despite being well groomed and well dressed raises potential questions of discrimination. The question encourages the reader to consider how such policies might be viewed under different legal regimes, including whether they might be considered discriminatory or constitutionally problematic. 3. What effect could having a policy of only allowing couples to enter have on the atmosphere and clientele of a bar? This question invites the reader to think about how the \\"only couples\\" policy might affect the bar's atmosphere and clientele. It could lead to a deeper discussion on how such policies might influence the bar's demographic, whether it might limit diversity, and how it might impact the broader culture and social dynamics of the bar. It also opens up a discussion on whether such policies could potentially be used as a means to consciously shape and control a bar's clientele and atmosphere. 4. How can bars balance the need to create a specific atmosphere, for example, by having an 'Only couples' admission policy, with the need to avoid potentially discriminatory practices? This question takes a more pragmatic approach, examining how bars might balance the desire to create a particular atmosphere with the need to avoid practices that could potentially be seen as discriminatory. It suggests that the issue is not black-and-white, and encourages the reader to consider potential solutions or compromises that might allow bars to achieve their desired atmosphere while also respecting individual rights and freedoms. For example, it might lead to a discussion on potential alternative admission policies that could achieve similar results without excluding single individuals or non-couples. 5. What message does the 'Only couples' admission policy send to individuals, and how might it impact their perception of the bar or their desire to patronize it in the future? Finally, this question asks the reader to consider the policy from the perspective of individuals who are denied entry. It might lead to a discussion about how such experiences of rejection can impact individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards the bar, and may affect their decision to patronize the bar in the future. It might also invite reflections on the broader message that the policy sends about who is valued and welcomed in such spaces, and the impacts this may have on individuals' feelings of inclusivity and belonging."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

No","output":"To determine the right answer, let's examine the two options more closely: 1). Yes - If we consider that humans can teach animals how to behave through training, discipline, and positive reinforcement, it's reasonable to say that humans can play a significant role in shaping animal behavior. However, this option does not account for the exercise aspect mentioned in the question. 2). No - If we focus on the fact that exercise is emphasized as a factor that can teach animals how to behave, then choosing \\"humans\\" as the sole answer might not be entirely accurate. Animals can also learn behavior through other means, such as socialization with other animals, instinct, and environmental factors. Given the context, the answer to the question \\"what can teach animals how to behave?\\" with an emphasis on exercise is: Option 2). No This is because exercise can indeed teach animals how to behave, but it is not solely dependent on humans.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.  Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid.  I am facing a new situation today: China used alternative fuels to generate electricity, while Mongolia burned lots of fossil fuels. There were frequent debates between the two countries on this matter.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country caused more deforestation? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the correlation between fossil fuel usage, deforestation, and carbon dioxide emissions can be drawn. However, with the given information about China using alternative fuels and Mongolia burning lots of fossil fuels, there is no direct evidence to conclude which country caused more deforestation. It is important to note that deforestation contributes to carbon dioxide emissions, as trees absorb and store carbon dioxide. When trees are cut down or burned, this stored carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. While Mongolia burning fossil fuels does lead to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, this information alone cannot definitively indicate its impact on deforestation. Similarly, China using alternative fuels for electricity generation implies a lower carbon dioxide emission from its energy sector, but it doesn't necessarily reflect its actions regarding deforestation. To accurately determine which country caused more deforestation, additional information on each country's forestry management practices, land-use changes, and other relevant factors would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: In addition to diversity sessions, many campuses train students on exactly what constitutes sexual consent as well as how to intervene when they see fellow students drinking excessively or poised to engage in nonconsensual sexual behavior. A bystander intervention presentation for arriving freshmen at Wesleyan University last Thursday — “We Speak We Stand” — featured students acting out fictional episodes of campus sexual violence, harassment and problematic drinking, with examples of how to intervene. “Each of you has the power to bring to light sexual violence in our community,” one student told the group. Fresh on the minds of university officials are last year’s highly publicized episodes involving racist taunts at the University of Missouri — which appear to have contributed to a precipitous decline in enrollment there this fall. “That closes your doors,” said Archie Ervin, the vice president for institute diversity at Georgia Institute of Technology and president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. “If you have sustained enrollment drops and disproportionately full-paying students such as out-of-state, the state legislature can’t make up the gap.” At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, officials have put together a diversity presentation as a pilot program this year for 1,000 freshmen — whom some colleges refer to with the gender-neutral term first-year students. That program, expected to cost 150,000 to 200,000, follows incidents on campus last year. In one, a racist note was slipped under a black student’s door, prompting Patrick Sims, the university’s vice provost for diversity and climate, to post an emotional video on YouTube titled “Enough Is Enough.” Lori Berquam, the university’s dean of students, said in an interview that the sessions would try to address the fact that some students in Wisconsin, a predominantly white state, had little exposure to people of other races until they got to Madison. “It would not be unheard-of for a student to join us from the state of Wisconsin having had zero people of color in their high school,” Dr. Berquam said. In August, the University of Wisconsin system, which includes the Madison flagship and 25 other campuses, said it would ask the State Legislature for 6 million in funding to improve what it called the “university experience” for students. The request includes money for Fluent, a program described as a systemwide cultural training for faculty and staff members and students. But that budget request has provoked controversy. “If only the taxpayers and tuition-paying families had a safe space that might protect them from wasteful U.W. System spending on political correctness,” State Senator Stephen L. Nass, a Republican, said in a statement issued by his office, urging his fellow lawmakers to vote against the appropriation. Mr. Nass’s objection to spending money on diversity training reflects a rising resistance to what is considered campus political correctness. At some universities, alumni and students have objected to a variety of campus measures, including diversity training; “safe spaces,” places where students from marginalized groups can gather to discuss their experiences; and “trigger warnings,” disclaimers about possibly upsetting material in lesson plans. Some graduates have curtailed donations, and students have suggested that diversity training smacks of some sort of Communist re-education program. The backlash was exemplified recently in a widely publicized letter sent to new freshmen at the University of Chicago by the dean of students, John Ellison. He warned that the university did not “support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.” Still, the push to respond to complaints about subtle cultural insensitivity, as well as more overt racist behavior, continues on campuses across the country. About 75 chief diversity officers have been hired by colleges and universities in the past 18 months, according to Dr. Ervin’s organization. Ms. Marlowe, a lawyer who most recently was diversity officer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was also recruited by two other colleges this year before settling at Clark, a manicured campus of about 3,000 students an hour west of Boston in this heavily working-class city. Her two-hour presentation on Aug. 27 aimed to help students identify microaggressions and to teach them how to intervene when they observe one. Microaggressions can be verbal, nonverbal or environmental, she said. “What’s an environmental microaggression?” Ms. Marlowe asked the auditorium of about 525 new students. She gave an example. “On your first day of class, you enter the chemistry building and all of the pictures on the wall are scientists who are white and male,” she said. “If you’re a female, or you just don’t identify as a white male, that space automatically shows that you’re not represented.” A nonverbal microaggression could be when a white woman clutches her purse as a black or Latino person approaches. Another subset of microaggression is known as the microinvalidation, which includes comments suggesting that race plays a minor role in life’s outcomes, like “Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough.” For Clark students like Noelia Martinez, a Massachusetts resident who was born in Puerto Rico to Dominican parents, the session was an epiphany. “It helped me understand what I’ve been going through all of my life, basically,” she said, describing how she had endured stinging comments such as “You’re a really good student for a Hispanic.” But Ms. Martinez, a sophomore transfer student, also realized that she, too, was guilty of microaggressions, because she frequently uses the phrase “you guys,” she said. “This helped me see that I’m a microaggressor, too.” The presentation elicited a lively question-and-answer session, during which students asked about the N word, discrimination against white people and men, and the definition of “Asian.” Ms. Marlowe said she questioned the validity of the concept of reverse racism, arguing that racism is a system in which a dominant race benefits from the oppression of others. But some students appeared slightly confused. “When you use the term ‘self-identify’ as a white woman, are you saying that you can choose your race?” one white male student asked. “I’ll give you an example,” Ms. Marlowe said. “I went to a conference. I was talking to this man. I thought he was black. I was talking about diversity and social justice.” “He said, ‘I’m Cuban,’” Ms. Marlowe told the crowd. “I assumed he was black because he was the same skin complexion as me, and the same type of hair.” But, Ms. Marlowe said, while it is sometimes difficult to identify a person’s racial or ethnic background based on appearance, she does not believe that gives license to people like Rachel A. Dolezal, the white woman who claimed to be African-American while working for the N.A.A.C.P. in Spokane, Wash. “You can’t say you’re black if you’re not, historically.” The student still seemed confused. “Maybe we can unpack it afterward,” Ms. Marlowe told the student. “You want to come see me afterward?” A version of this article appears in print on September 7, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Campus 101: Learning How Not to Offend.

Answer:","output":"Sir Ernest Shackleton, a notable British polar explorer, was born on February 15, 1874, in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland.  In 1884, when Shackleton was just ten years old, his family moved to London, England. The decision to relocate was largely attributed to his father Henry's decision to study medicine, which eventually resulted in him becoming a qualified doctor. Shackleton remained in England for a significant portion of his life. It was in London that he completed his education, attending Dulwich College from 1887 to 1890. He then started his maritime career in 1890, initially working in the merchant navy and then progressively making a name for himself in polar exploration. Being a polar explorer, Shackleton spent substantial time away from traditional residences. He made several attempts to reach the South Pole, in a series of expeditions known collectively as the Nimrod Expedition (1907-1909), the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-1917) and the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition (1921-1922). These polar journeys saw him spending extended periods in the harsh environs of Antarctica. Despite these arduous expeditions, Shackleton maintained links to England. For instance, during the preparatory and recovery periods of his journeys, he operated out of London. Some records point to specific residences, such as his 1908 residence at 14 Milnthorpe Road, Eastbourne, towards the end of Nimrod Expedition.  Shackleton also bought a home in Sydenham, South-East London, where his wife Emily and their three children lived. However, due to his often extended absences and financial strains, Shackleton didn't spend much time there. These financial problems eventually forced Shackleton to sell the house. In his later years, Shackleton was planning another expedition to Antarctica but suffered a heart attack and died while his ship was moored in South Georgia, a British Overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean. He was buried there, following the wish of his wife, Emily, who felt it was appropriate for him to be laid to rest in the region he had dedicated so much of his life to exploring. Therefore, his final residence is, essentially, the Grytviken cemetery in South Georgia. In conclusion, though Sir Ernest Shackleton was born in Ireland and died in South Georgia, he spent most of his residential life in England, particularly in London. However, as an explorer, he also spent considerable time in the polar regions of Antarctica, which became an important part of his existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He told of different men and of strange civilizations, broken up by long 'dark ages' in between. In his view, what is called the present time is no more than a moment in human history and we are just the First Men. In 2,000 million years from now there will be the Eighteenth or Last Men.  However, most of our ideas about the future are really very short-sighted. Perhaps we can see some possibilities for the next fifty years. But the next hundred? The next thousand? The next million? That's much more difficult. When men and women lived by hunting 50,000 years ago, how could they even begin to picture modern life? Yet to men of 50,000 years from now, we may seem as primitive in our ideas as the Stone-Age hunters do to us. Perhaps they will spend their days goallocking to make new spundles, or struggling with their ballalators through the cribe. These words, which I have just made up, have to stand for things and ideas that we simply can't think of.  So why bother even to try imagining life far in the future? Here are two reasons. First, unless we remember how short our own lives are compared with the whole human history, we are likely to think our own interests are much more important than they really are. If we make the earth a poor place to live on, because we are careless or greedy or quarrelsome, our grandchildren will not bother to think of excuses for us.  Second, by trying to escape from present interests and imagine life far in the future, we may arrive at quite fresh ideas that we can use ourselves. For example, if we imagine that in the future men may give up farming, we can think of trying it now. So set your imagination free when you think about the future.

The Chinese premier who referred to the actions of the US and the United Nations as an act of aggression was Zhou Enlai. Zhou was the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, serving from October 1949 until his death in January 1976. As the main diplomat and policy maker of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhou played significant roles in Chinese history, including the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Korean War, and China’s opening to the West. The statement you've mentioned refers to President Harry S. Truman's response to North Korea's invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which marked the beginning of the Korean War. Truman's decision to intervene in Korea was due to his commitment to containment – the Cold War strategy designed to resist the global spread of communism. He sent the Seventh Fleet to protect Taiwan (the Republic of China), a move which was also aimed at preventing the conflict from escalating and spreading across the region. However, China viewed these actions as aggressive. When the US and its United Nations allies crossed the 38th parallel while chasing the retreating North Korean forces, Zhou Enlai interpreted it as potential threat against China. As a result, Chinese troops began entering North Korea in October 1950, marking a turning point in the Korean War. It's also worth noting that, at the time, China was not a member of the United Nations due to Cold War tensions, the question of recognizing the People's Republic of China's government, and the USA's support for Taiwan, which continued to hold China's seat at the UN. So, from the perspective of Chinese leaders, the UN and US actions were seen as unfair and aggressive, expressing interests that were contrary to Chinese sovereignty and regional security."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:An eight-year-old female Star Wars fan forced Disney to change its labelling policy after she complained her Darth Vader costume was marked 'for boys'. Izzy Cornthwaite, from Chorley, Lancashire, was disappointed to find the distinctive outfit she wanted to wear was classed not for girls - so she wrote to the industry giant to complain. Her concerns were so inspiring that the international company changed its policy, and now all outfits sold in the Disney Store are labelled as 'for kids'. Izzy's mum Becky Heyes said: 'All the Star Wars collection was for boys. There was no Princess Leia suit or anything to do with girls.Izzy Cornthwaite was desperate to dress up as the leader of the Dark SideHowever, only Darth Vader costume she could buy was labelled 'for boys'After purchasing outfit and light saber, contacted Disney to complainEntertainment giant has since relabelled all their costumes, with each outfit now sold as gender neutral   Question:_'s deputy headteacher, Nick Roden said: 'It's amazing that a child so young can manage to get a multi-national corporation to change their policy for the better.

He is then attacked by a swarm of bats emerging from a large gaping crack at the well base.Present: Bruce wakes up from the nightmare in a Chinese prison. It becomes apparent that Bruce is regularly attacked by other inmates who brawl with him 6 to 1 at breakfast. Having beaten the majority of them, Bruce is punished with solitary confinement by the prison guards. In solitary, Bruce is approached by a man called Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard displays a great deal of knowledge and authority by getting an audience with Bruce from the prison and by stating that he knows who Bruce is. Ducard then offers Bruce a place in the League of Shadows -- a collective of vigilantes and assassins. He deems that the League can offer Bruce a path to true justice instead of 'locking himself away with criminals to take them on one at a time.'

I have a new situation: Stephanie and Barb are two friends that belong to a sailing club. They are having a lunch at the cafe in the club and discussing their latest boat purchases. Stephanie mentions that her latest boat she has been using has cavitation. Barb takes a bite of her sandwich and remarks that the boat she is currently using doesn't have any cavitation.  But I can use this background: Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of tidal stream turbines.When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military submarines, as it increases the chances of being detected by passive sonar.  What is an answer for this question: Would you be less likely to spill a bowl of soup on Stephanie's boat or Barb's boat? The answer to this question is:","output":"You would be less likely to spill a bowl of soup on Barb's boat. The reason behind this lies in the fact that Stephanie's boat has cavitation, which is an undesirable occurrence in many cases, as mentioned in the background information provided.  Cavitation can cause various issues, such as a significant amount of noise, damage to the boat's components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. When cavitation bubbles collapse, they create spots of high temperature, shock waves, and noise, all of which can lead to instability in the boat's performance and potentially affect the overall stability of the vessel. On the other hand, Barb's boat does not have any cavitation issues, which means that it is likely to provide a more stable and smooth ride. The absence of cavitation problems in Barb's boat suggests that there would be fewer vibrations, less noise, and a more efficient performance, which would contribute to a smoother and more stable experience onboard the boat. Considering the various challenges and issues that cavitation can cause for the boat's performance and stability, it is reasonable to conclude that you would be less likely to spill a bowl of soup on Barb's boat compared to Stephanie's boat. This is because the absence of cavitation in Barb's boat would provide a smoother and more stable ride, reducing the chances of instability or sudden movements that could cause you to spill the soup."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Ideally, you want at least 6 players per team for a competitive game. However, if you're playing with a group of friends, keep the same number of players on each side.  You should have 2 rows of players, with the first row closest to the net and the back row closest to the rear boundary of the court. The player in the back right corner will serve the ball. You can rotate players around the court so that you will have a new server for each service game. If you are rotating players out, rotate clockwise -- looking at the net, the player closest to it on the right side would rotate out, allowing for many players to play. Toss a coin or form an agreement to find out who will begin the game. If you serve from in front of the line it will be a point for the other team.  This is known as a foot fault. The ball has to go over the net (but it can touch), and it has to land within the court for the serve to be good.  The player on the right-hand side at the back of the court serves. Each player will only receive one service attempt per serve rotation; you may serve as many times as you can get the ball in the other teams court. The ball is good even if it lands on a line. Thus the rally has begun! A typical play will be bump, set, spike -- but as long as it goes over within three hits, it's good.  Technically, you can hit the ball with any part of your body so long as the ball does not come to a rest. Players may go over the lines, but the ball may not. If a player on your team hits it out of bounds, you may run to retrieve it -- successfully so if it doesn't touch the ground. This could be because of any one of the following:  The ball hits the ground. This can cause the serving team to score 1 point for their team.  If the ball hits the ground on the side of the serving team, then the other team has the opportunity to serve. If the ball hits the ground on the side of the receiving team, then the serving team can serve again. The point is awarded to the team that did not allow the ball to hit the ground.   The ball goes out of bounds. The team that hits the ball out of bounds loses the point. Someone touches the net. If a player on one team touches the net, then the opposing team picks up a point. Someone's foot goes under the net. When this happens, the opposing team receives the point. Someone hits the ball 2 consecutive times. Players can't strike the ball twice in a row, unless a strike is in the block. A block does not count as a touch. A team hits the ball 4 or more times without sending it over. 3 is the maximum. Catching the ball without bumping it on the acceptance from play. Letting the recipient team receive the ball bump from anything besides their arms or hands can cause the serving team to pick up a point. Returning the ball without allowing the ball to cross over the top of the net will score one point for the serving team. The team that won the last point gets to serve the ball. If you're rotating, rotate now.  If your team has the ball, it's common for the rows to back up a bit. The idea here is to get ready for an attack. If you don't have the ball, move forward. The idea instead here is to make the attack. Teams who produce an error or send the ball out-of-play will automatically send the ball over to the other team to serve. No extra score must be added to the \\"new\\" serving team. NO penalty may be given in any situation where the ball touches the net then goes over to the other side to be played. The ball continues to be live and playable (unless it comes back towards the recipient team on the volley). You can decide how many points you will allow for each game. For instance, you can start a new game when a team earns 15 points.  Recent rules state that regulation games go to 25 points, with the third game (in a set of three) going to 15. Sometimes, games may take the form of ending with a certain time limit but this must be agreed upon - generally, this time limit will be eight minutes, but may be longer or shorter dependent on situation for the game. A standard match is three games long. Each team should switch sides at the start of a new game. The loosing team during each service should have the chance to serve in the next game of the match.  A game must be won by two points. 25-26 will not cut it; it must be 25-27. Because of this, close games can go on much longer.","output":"This article explains how to play a fun volleyball game with friends, including setting up teams, serving the ball, and scoring points by following certain rules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So Columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched! And I don't know what happened at the Oscars. This should have swept Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Direction, best cinematography. What films were they watching?

This means that their lungs can store more oxygen and release more carbon dioxide. Step 4: Determine the effect on shallow breathing Shallow breathing refers to taking smaller breaths and not using the full lung capacity. With a larger lung capacity, a person may have more efficient gas exchange, and it will take more time to fill the lungs with air.

The Asian Games Village Automobile Exchange is the biggest car dealership inBeijing.General manager Guo Yong says the business sells more than 2,000 cars each week.Guo says it is much easier for Chinese consumers to buy a car now.Also,the emergence of less expensive domestic brands like Chery and BYD means more Chinese can afford cars.

I tried to call you all night.","output":"No, the word \\"call\\" is not used in the same way in these two sentences. In the English language, the word \\"call\\" can have multiple meanings and can be used as different parts of speech – usually as a verb, but occasionally as a noun as well. Let's examine the usage of \\"call\\" in each sentence. 1. Call a football game. In this sentence, \\"call\\" is used as a verb. It has the meaning of officiating, overseeing, or narrating a football game – which generally refers to the role of a referee, an announcer, or a commentator. For example, a referee would \\"call\\" a football game by enforcing the rules, observing the players' actions, and making decisions such as calling penalties, declaring fouls, or ruling a play out-of-bounds. An announcer or commentator would \\"call\\" a game by describing or analyzing the events, providing insights, and sharing information with the viewers or listeners. Therefore, in this context, \\"call\\" is not related to making a phone call or communication but rather to the act of overseeing or narrating an event. 2. I tried to call you all night. In this sentence, \\"call\\" is again used as a verb. However, its meaning is different from the first sentence. Here, \\"call\\" refers to the act of attempting to communicate through a phone call. The speaker is conveying that they tried to reach the other person via telephone throughout the night, but were unable to establish contact. This can imply that the person didn't answer the phone or that technical issues, such as poor network connection or a dead battery, prevented a successful phone call. In summary, the word \\"call\\" is used differently in these two sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to officiating, overseeing, or narrating a football game, while in the second sentence, it means attempting to make a phone call in order to communicate with someone. The variety of meanings that the word \\"call\\" can have demonstrates the flexibility of the English language and highlights the importance of context in understanding the intended meaning of a word."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the total external disk storage system market , McArthur said revenue increased 1.5 percent year-over-year in Q3 to  3.2 billion . OPT: [i] no. [ii] yes.","output":"[ii] yes. These two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, despite slight differences in their structure and wording. Both sentences report an increase in revenue in the total external disk storage system market. Let's analyze the two sentences for further clarification. Sentence 1: In the total external disk storage system market, revenue increased 1.5 percent year over year in the third quarter, to 3.2 billion. Sentence 2: In the total external disk storage system market, McArthur said revenue increased 1.5 percent year-over-year in Q3 to 3.2 billion. The core information in both sentences is the same: the total external disk storage system market experienced a 1.5 percent increase in revenue year over year, and the total revenue in the third quarter (Q3) was 3.2 billion. The main difference between the sentences lies in the following details: 1. In the first sentence, year over year is written as separate words, while in the second sentence, it appears as a hyphenated compound word (year-over-year). However, both phrases express the same idea; they compare the revenue figures between the same quarters in consecutive years. 2. The second sentence includes a source, McArthur, who provided the information about the revenue increase. Apart from attributing the statement to a specific person, this addition does not change the overall meaning of the sentence. 3. The second sentence uses 'Q3' as an abbreviation for 'third quarter.' This change in phrasing also does not impact the overall meaning of the sentence. In conclusion, despite these minor variations in structure and wording, both sentences convey the same core meaning. Therefore, the answer is [ii] yes, the sentences have the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts.

Write an article with the title: \\"IT Is From Venus, Non-IT Is From Mars\\" Article:","output":"Title: IT Is From Venus, Non-IT Is From Mars Introduction From the dawn of time, humans have always been intrigued by the concept of differences – whether it pertains to cultures, genders, or professions. Such distinctions have permeated our daily lives, sometimes quite subtly, creating an environment where certain stereotypes and misconceptions abound. In this spirit, it appears that the IT (Information Technology) sector and the non-IT industry seem to hail from two distinct planets – much like Venus and Mars – in terms of mindsets, cultures, and work styles. Given this backdrop, one might be tempted to ask – why such a distinction? In the world of business and technology, each sector thrives by catering to unique goals, objectives, and standards. This article explores the reasons underlying the contrast between IT and non-IT industries, delving into the fundamental elements that set them apart. Mindset - Logic vs. Creativity Focusing on cognitive processes can shed light on the first layer of distinction. IT professionals are often governed by logic and analytical thinking. Their primary objectives revolve around creating and maintaining systems, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring the seamless functioning of digital infrastructure. This requires a mindset that can effortlessly dissect complex issues, code, and design systems with a high degree of precision. On the other hand, the non-IT sector is typified by a more creative and visionary approach. Professions such as marketing, sales, and business development demand constant innovation, adaptability, and imaginative thinking. These individuals need to form strong interpersonal connections and think outside the box to achieve their goals. This does not, however, imply that IT professionals lack creative flair or problem-solving abilities. Rather, the primary distinction lies in the predominant mindset governing each domain. Culture - Geek Chic vs. Corporate Suave Evolving from the mindset, we arrive at the shared culture and workspace design. IT professionals tend to have more relaxed office environments, often designed to fuel creativity and provide a sense of comfort. Casual attire, flexible schedules, and open-space layouts exemplify a sector that embraces the \\"geek chic\\" culture, as opposed to a buttoned-down corporate aesthetic. The non-IT sector leans towards traditional corporate structures. Rigid scheduling, hierarchical workflows, and formal dress codes are persistently widespread in many non-IT industries. These aspects may be attributed to valuing time-tested policies, stability, and formality, which is not to say that every non-IT office is a corporate maze. The difference primarily lies in the emphasis on corporate norms and values. Work Styles - Process vs. Outcome Another crucial differentiator is the approach to work, which is closely linked to the aforementioned mindset factor. IT professionals thrive on building, modifying, and maintaining various technology frameworks. They inherently value process-oriented work and revel in the technical complexities of their tasks. On the contrary, non-IT professionals are results-driven and largely concerned with achieving targets or securing clients. They worry less about the intricacies of their field – drawing greater satisfaction from the successful completion of tasks. The non-IT industry generally emphasizes quick wins, communication skills, and networking, with evolving targets and goals. Career Progression - Expertise vs. Generalization Last but not least, career progression offers yet another interesting angle to this dichotomy. IT professionals often progress by honing their skills and gaining expertise in various programming languages, software solutions, or systems management. The IT landscape places a high premium on in-depth knowledge and specialization, making continuous learning an essential aspect of an IT professional's career growth. In comparison, non-IT professionals might focus more on mastering skills to become effective leaders or managers while climbing the corporate ladder. Frequently, exposure to diverse industry experiences and problem-solving capabilities takes precedence over specialization. This trajectory ultimately carves a path for upper management or cross-sector exploration for career development. Conclusion The IT and non-IT realms might appear to inhabit entirely different planets, but in truth, they complement each other perfectly. In today's world, the integration of both sectors plays a pivotal role in enhancing technological advancements and achieving groundbreaking accomplishments. Cherishing these distinctions allows the right talent to thrive by aligning individuals' talents and passions with the appropriate environment, while fostering harmony in expectations and deliverables. After all, both Venus and Mars are known for their unique attributes and characteristics – making them integral parts of the cosmic tapestry that is our vast hinterland."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. In this task, you are given two questions about a domain. Your task is to combine the main subjects of the questions to write a new, natural-sounding question. For example, if the first question is about the tallness of the president and the second question is about his performance at college, the new question can be about his tallness at college. Try to find the main idea of each question, then combine them; you can use different words or make the subjects negative (i.e., ask about shortness instead of tallness) to combine the subjects. The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are \\"this national park\\", \\"this dog breed\\", and \\"this president\\", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. Hence, in the new question, this keyword should also be used the same way. Do not write unnatural questions. (i.e., would not be a question someone might normally ask about domains). Do not write open-ended or subjective questions. (e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people.) If you couldn't find the answer to your question from a single Google search, try to write a different question.

Usage: \\"Are there any tall glaciers near the kayaking permitted areas in this national park?\\" In this question, the main idea of tall glaciers and kayaking are combined, and the keyword \\"this national park\\" is retained. Part #3: Ensuring naturalness and not open-ended or subjective. Usage: The question is natural as it asks whether any tall glaciers are located near kayaking spots, and the answer would be factual, not subjective. Part #4: Verifying the question's answer can be found with a Google search.

REPORTING FROM BEIRUT — The macabre and divisive drama about the decomposing remains of Moammar Kadafi appears to have come to a conclusion. Reports out of Libya indicate that Kadafi’s body was buried at dawn Tuesday in a secret location. Also reportedly buried were the remains of his son, Mutassim, and a former chief military aide, Abu Bakr Yunis. According to international news reports, the bodies were washed and an Islamic ceremony was conducted in front of relatives and local political and military authorities. [Updated, 7:48 a.m., Oct. 25: The burials came amid reports that another of Kadafi’s sons — his one-time heir apparent, Seif Islam Kadafi — was heading for the nation of Niger just south of Libya. Rissa ag Boula, an advisor to Niger's president and an elected official in the northern Niger town of Agadez, told Associated Press that he was in touch with ethnic Tuaregs who are helping guide the younger Kadafi through southern Libya to Niger. “If he comes here, the government will accept him, but the government will also need to respect its international obligations,” Boula said, noting that Seif Islam is wanted by the International Criminal Court. Niger has said it will turn over members of Kadafi’s regime wanted by the court. The body of the senior Kadafi had been on public display inside a vegetable cold-storage locker in the coastal city of Misurata. The bodies of Mutassim and the leader’s former aide were later laid down next to Kadafi’s.] Images of the gruesome spectacle of Libyans posing alongside the gradually decomposing bodies were broadcast worldwide, drawing both morbid interest and revulsion. Many Libyans came from miles to view the remains and record the moment with photos and video of the corpse of the man who ruled Libya for more than four decades. Delaying the decision on the ultimate disposal of the corpses were reported disagreements between officials in Misurata and authorities of Libya’s transitional leadership in Tripoli, the capital. Libya’s new rulers didn’t want Kadafi's burial place to become a shrine for ex-supporters or a rallying point for potential pro-Kadafi insurgents. Kadafi’s family demanded that the remains be turned over to tribal kin in his hometown, Surt. All three were reported captured alive Thursday in Surt as the city was overrun by revolutionary fighters after weeks of intense battles. How the three died remains a matter of controversy. Libyan authorities in Tripoli say Kadafi likely died in crossfire during the heated last morning of the battle for Surt. Others say the evidence indicates Kadafi was executed with a bullet to the his head while he was a prisoner. Amateur video showed fighters manhandling and shouting at the bloodied, dazed Kadafi after his capture. Succumbing to international pressure, authorities have vowed to investigate the matter.

Good Charlotte is an American rock band from Waldorf, Maryland, that formed in 1996. Since 1998, the band's constant members have been vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist and vocalist Benji Madden, bassist Paul Thomas, guitarist and keyboardist Billy Martin, while drummer Dean Butterworth has been a member of the band since 2005. After a four-year-long hiatus, the band announced its comeback on November 3, 2015. The band has released six studio albums: Good Charlotte (2000), The Young and the Hopeless (2002), The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004), Good Morning Revival (2007), Cardiology (2010) and Youth Authority (2016), as well as two compilations: Greatest Remixes (2008) and Greatest Hits (2010). Good Charlotte's third album, The Chronicles of Life and Death, was released by Epic Records in 2004. The album received mixed reactions from both the music press and Good Charlotte's fan base. The album sold 2.2 million copies. The album has been widely considered a departure from the band's previous two albums, mixing new elements such as lyrical topics into Good Charlotte's youthful sound. Singles released from the album include the two hits \\"Predictable\\" and \\"I Just Wanna Live\\", as well as \\"The Chronicles of Life and Death\\" and \\"We Believe\\". The only single from The Chronicles of Life and Death which managed to chart on the U.S. Hot 100 was the hit \\"I Just Wanna Live\\". All of the singles released from the album went top 30 in the UK, except for \\"We Believe\\". The band would then go on tour with Sum 41.  In May 2005, after much speculation from fans, it was officially confirmed that Chris Wilson had left the band citing personal health reasons. Benji also told Kerrang! magazine that, for him, \\"Chris leaving the band was the worst part of 2005.\\" Chris then joined the pop/punk band The Summer Obsession until 2011. He currently plays drums for JMSN.  On Good Charlotte's \\"Noise to the World\\" Tour, performing with Simple Plan and Relient K, the band recruited Dean Butterworth (who had previously played for Morrissey) as the band's temporary drummer. Later, in March 2007, Butterworth was confirmed as the band's permanent drummer.

You can find it here! ||||| via Reddit      Updated 9:20 a.m.: American treasure , Man who believed Trayvon Martin's fatal shooting was \\"justified,\\" St. Louis native, winner of the second 2016 presidential debate and still-not-quite-decided voter Kenneth Bone graced Reddit with his very own AMA Thursday evening—and at first, it was even more glorious than we could have hoped. Unfortunately for him, it was overshadowed by Reddit users who noticed his extensive and weird Reddit comment history, which included commenting on the death of Trayvon Martin.      Bone, as GQ, Gizmodo and others have noted, tried to do an AMA a day ago but shut it down after users realized he was posting from his regular Reddit account—a.k.a., the account he has used to discuss such subjects as Jennifer Lawrence's right to privacy (“Maybe she should have been more careful with her pics, but the bad guys are still the ones who sought them out and looked at them. By which I mean guys like me. I saw her butt hole. I liked it.”), his thoughts on pregnant women (“beautiful human submarines”), and left this comment on a thread about Martin's fatal shooting in Florida at the hands of George Zimmerman:      \\"It doesn't have to be a one or the other view here. From what I read about the case, the shooting of Trayvon Martin was justified, but from what I've learned of Zimmerman through statements, interview, and behavior he is a big ole shit bird. Bad guy legally kills kid in self defense. Sucks for everybody, including us due to the media fuckery.\\"      Ugh, no.      We're not the only ones who thought Bone would be the meme-making treasure that America needed at first: even Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted about \\"impeccably dressed\\" Bone this week, and Bone's unique combination of red sweater, aggressive mustache, and je ne sais quoi spawned a thousand think pieces.      Ken \\"I mustache you a question\\" Bone, rose to his current status as king of memes Sunday night after he asked Clinton and Donald Trump a question about energy policy during the second debate. He went back on Reddit Thursday night to weigh in on less controversial matters, including Halloween costumes and whether he would announce how he plans to vote on Nov. 8. He also bragged about his \\"hot wife\\" (um...) got an invitation to smoke from Snoop Dogg himself, and pimped his new T-shirt campaign, which he will use in part to raise money for a St. Louis organization that helps the homeless. He curiously did not pimp his new relationship with Uber:      Hello Reddit, I’m just a normal guy, who spends his free time with his hot wife and cat in St. Louis. I didn’t see any of this coming, it’s been a crazy week. I want to make something good come out of this moment, so I’m donating a portion of the proceeds from my Represent T-Shirt campaign to the St. Patrick Center raising money to fight homelessness in St. Louis.      Reddit users were all over the most recent AMA, which started shortly after 7 p.m. Central Time, quickly identifying the 34-year-old Bone as \\"one of us, one of us...\\" for his quick-witted, instant-meme-generator replies. On the phenomenon of Sexy Ken Bone Halloween costumes, Bone replied that he was already a Sexy Ken Bone, thank you very much, and would more likely be going as \\"Obi Wan Kenboni\\" this year for Halloween:      When asked whether he would run as an Independent in the next presidential election, Bone did not rule it out. However, \\"I don't even go to HOA meetings,\\" he wrote, so don't count on it. He said he is getting closer to deciding how to vote, but will not be announcing his vote because \\"I want you all to make up your own minds.\\"      Bone also showed he wasn't above self-parody:      Read on to learn more about meme-master Ken Bone, why he reps '60s-era St. Louis Cardinal Mike Shannon, and how he plans to hook his dad up with Snoop Dogg in L.A.             ||||| Talk about building them up to knock them down.      With his red sweater and earnest questions about energy policy at the Clinton/Trump town hall debate, Kenneth Bone quickly became a shorthand for all that is right about American democracy: mutual respect, caring about the issues, and the truly unifying power of a pun on the word “bone.”      While cable news networks quibbled about whether Clinton or Trump had won the debate, the internet knew who the true winner was, and everyone wanted to be in the #bonezone.      Kenneth spent most of this week touring TV studios, packing in a schedule of public appearances of which any political commentator would be envious. He’s even slated to be one of the guests on a special live edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live! airing after the third presidential debate.      Now that guest slot—and his reputation overall—may be in jeopardy.      The first rumblings of discontent came when Ken started cashing in on his newfound fame (as any of us would, really), posting an illegal ad for Uber’s luxury car service Uber Select on Twitter on Thursday (his following on the social-media network has skyrocketed from seven, two of which were his grandma, to 237,000 and climbing.)      Ken’s de-beatification was made complete, however, after he was invited to host an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit.      The wheels fell off the Bone-mobile as Ken unwisely used the same alias in the AMA that he had used to make a variety of decidedly less than wholesome remarks over the past few years.      Here, for example, is Ken weighing in on the hacked nude Jennifer Lawrence pictures:      “Maybe she should have been more careful with her pics, but the bad guys are still the ones who sought them out and looked at them. By which I mean guys like me. I saw her butt hole. I liked it.”      That’s so gross that you can almost imagine Donald Trump saying it. Lawrence herself has said of the stolen images, “Anybody who looked at those pictures, you’re perpetuating a sexual offense. You should cower with shame.”      It turns out that Bone was a regular participant in several NSFW forums, including one devoted to pregnant women in swimsuits, who he referred to as “beautiful human submarines.”      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

He even admitted to committing “felony insurance fraud”:      Most damaging of all, he suggested the killing of Trayvon Martin was “legally justified”—however we should note that Bone did go on to add that George Zimmerman, who was acquitted in the killing of the unarmed teenager on the basis of Florida’s controversial Stand Your Ground law, was a “big ole shit bird.”      “Bad guy legally kills kid in self defence,” he wrote. “Sucks for everybody, including us due to media fuckery.”      Will this election cycle drain the good out of everything? ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Kenneth Bone, who gained fame after the second US presidential debate, has been further scrutinized following an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on Reddit.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? Considering my less than glowing feelings about the \\"Immortal\\" show, I wanted to see if anything could be salvaged out of this rush of new MJ related entertainment.  So in order to try to find some sort of balance and sense out of this experience, I tried this \\"Fan Fest\\".  Was this truly \\"for the fans\\"?  I'd have to say \\"Yes\\".  It's striking how a bunch of inanimate objects and some livelier selections in music tracks could provide a much more entertaining event.  This event focused on costumes, props and sets from his music videos and live performances, numerous awards, and a glittering wardrobe and attention to lavishness that would give even Liberace pause.  Best of all, it was far more interactive than your average self-guided tour.  The staff encouraged you to sit on some of the prop items, and were all too happy to take photos.  The room was alive with Jackson's more pop and rock driven tunes, and while it played a slow song every once in awhile, it wasn't as heavy as the Cirque show was.  This seemed more like a celebration than the actual \\"tribute\\".  But how could one not be charmed by a recreation of his study with bookshelves and giant chess set, or the popcorn and ice cream trolleys from the Neverland estate, or a sampling of his arcade games, or the massively huge castle, or the Disney created dioramas that used to be in his movie theater?  There were also the lavish interiors of his numerous cars, or the collection of fan art, or people playing the Wii version of \\"Michael Jackson: The Experience\\".  Seriously, for someone who mourned the loss of his childhood, he had an amazing adulthood.  Or at the very least, he had some REALLY cool things to play with.  I was excited for the chance to play with the few items offered.  But the Fan Fest wasn't as large as I would have hoped (I know, we're never really satisfied, are we?).  After seeing online catalogs of an auction that would have taken place to sell his things years back, this almost felt like the tip of the iceberg of what could have been seen.  Don't believe me?  Here:  http://www.juliensauctions.com/auctions/2009/michael-jackson/catalog-list.html  Some of these things were at the Fan Fest, but you just wanted to experience more.  Regardless, I had fun at this Fest.  To see these things up close, and in select cases, touch them, made for a very personal, informative, and entertaining tour.  It makes me wish that they would just turn Hacienda Palomino (his old stomping grounds here) into a museum, because I think THAT would just be awesome....Available choices: --negative; --positive; I think the answer is","output":"--positive The review seems to be positive because the person enjoyed the \\"Fan Fest\\" and found it entertaining and interactive. They also mentioned that it felt like a celebration, and they had fun. The negative aspects mentioned, such as wishing for a bigger event, are minor compared to the overall positive experience.  The negative choice is incorrect because the person did enjoy the event and had fun, even though they had some minor complaints."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: The writing team of Nava and Thomas split the story into three parts: Arturo Xuncax: The first part takes place in a small rural Guatemalan village called San Pedro and introduces the Xuncax family, a group of indigenous Mayans. Arturo is a coffee picker and his wife a homemaker. Arturo explains to his son, Enrique, his world view and how the indio fares in Guatemalan life, noting that, \\"to the rich, the peasant is just a pair of strong arms\\".[4] Arturo and his family then discuss the possibility of going to the United States where \\"all the people, even the poor, own their own cars\\". Because of his attempts to form a labor union among the workers, Arturo and the other organizers are attacked and murdered by government troops when a co-worker is bribed to betray themâArturo's severed head is seen hanging from a tree.[5] When Enrique attempts to climb the tree that displays his father's head, a soldier attacks him. Enrique fights and kills the attacker, only to learn that many of their fellow villagers have been rounded up by soldiers. The children's mother too \\"disappears\\": abducted by soldiers.

What is the answer for the question: What song has mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo? from the following article ?  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record.

The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told.

EW has learned that a different episode â€” which was already known to boast Will Arnett as a guest star â€” features the voices of Apatow, frequent collaborators Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen, plus Channing Tatum and... Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford. EW: 'The Simpsons': Daniel Radcliffe to guest Fed up with movie theaters, Homer is taught by Bart how to illegally download films, and he starts screening them in his backyard for folks in Springfield. \\"Even though Homer is stealing, he's doing it for the community, he's doing it out of the goodness of his heart,\\" says executive producer Matt Selman.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the title of R.E.M.'s fourth album?, using the article: The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice.\\" The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and reached number..., what would be the answer ?

Catch one's breath.","output":"No, the word \\"catch\\" does not have the same definition in these two sentences. In fact, the word \\"catch\\" demonstrates polysemy, which means it has multiple related meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, \\"I have to catch a train at 7 o'clock,\\" the word \\"catch\\" refers to getting on or boarding the train before it departs. In this context, \\"catch\\" is used to express the action of reaching a vehicle (like a train, bus, or plane) in time to travel with it from one place to another. It implies a sense of urgency because there is a specific departure time, and if you do not arrive in time, you will miss the opportunity to catch, board, or travel on that specific train. In the second sentence, \\"Catch one's breath,\\" the word \\"catch\\" is used idiomatically and has a different meaning. In this context, \\"catch\\" means regaining or recovering one's normal breathing rhythm after it has been disturbed or disrupted, usually due to exertion, stress, or surprise. When you \\"catch your breath,\\" you're essentially allowing your body to settle back into a comfortable, steady breathing rate after it has been altered. It also implies taking a brief pause or moment of respite to do so. In summary, although the word \\"catch\\" is present in both sentences, its meaning changes based on the context. In the first sentence, it refers to boarding a train in time for departure, while in the second, it signifies the action of regaining one's breath. These variations demonstrate the polysemy of the word \\"catch\\" in the English language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Recently a research was carried out in London,Birmingham and Leeds among teachers from different schools about student behavior management. The majority of teachers said that behavior management is the biggest challenge they face in teaching.They are against the idea of a \\"one size fits all\\" approach to behavior management and believe that how they deal with behavior depends on their analysis of what is driving the behavior.Many teachers make the analysis in three steps.First,observe what the student is doing;then look into what drives the behavior and finally identify what is the real problem to deal with,e.g.attention seeking or being unable to follow the lessons etc..However,many teachers felt it sometimes difficult as schools did not always effectively communicate the necessary information about the students for them to do it. The behaviors are generally divided into low,mid and high level.Teachers felt low and high level behavior was easy to analyze and deal with because low level behavior was seen as the least serious of a problem;and there is clear structure in place for dealing with high level behavior. However,there is no clear structure and effective ways to address midlevel behavior,which may cause a sense of failure in some teachers. Teachers also felt that the laws to protect pupils have resulted in a sense of teachers having fewer rights to manage behavior.In case they deal with or be seen to deal with behavior wrongly or improperly,the results could be very serious:damage the child or teacher,especially their career. Question: What can be inferred from the passage? - A teacher risks losing the job if he/she manages student behavior improperly. - Teachers in England are not willing to manage student behaviors. - English laws forbid teachers punishing their students for their behaviors. - The laws to protect children in England are going to be changed.

My father was named James Page Jackson because he was born on the old Jackson plantation in Lancaster county, Virginia. He named one of his daughters Lancaster for a middle name in memory of his old home. Clarice Lancaster Jackson was her full name. A man named Galloway bought my father and brought him to Arkansas. Some called him by the name of Galloway, but my father always had all his children keep the name Jackson. There were fourteen of us, but only ten lived to grow up.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Refried beans (Spanish: \\"frijoles refritos\\") is a dish of cooked and mashed beans and is a traditional staple of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, although each cuisine has a different approach when making the dish. Refried beans are also popular in many other Latin American countries. Hypothesis: Refried beans are unhealthy.","output":"The hypothesis that refried beans are unhealthy is not directly addressed in the provided paragraph. The paragraph discusses what refried beans are and where they are traditionally consumed, but it does not provide any information on the nutritional or health aspects of the dish.  However, generally speaking, the healthiness of refried beans can vary widely depending on how they are prepared. Traditional refried beans are made by soaking and cooking pinto or black beans, then mashing and frying them in lard or oil, optionally with added ingredients like onions, garlic, and seasoning.  Beans themselves are a good source of dietary fiber and protein and contain many essential vitamins and minerals like potassium, iron, and folate. They are low in fat and have been linked to various health benefits, such as improving digestion, reducing the risk of heart disease, managing diabetes, and aiding weight loss. The potentially \\"unhealthy\\" aspect of refried beans could come from the preparation method. Frying the beans in lard or a lot of oil can add a significant amount of saturated fat and calories to the meal. Similarly, adding a lot of salt or cheese can make the dish high in sodium and unnecessary fats.  But it's also possible to make refried beans in a healthier way. For instance, using a minimal amount of healthier oils, like olive oil, and cutting back on added salts and high-fat ingredients can create a version that's lower in unhealthy fats and sodium, but still high in protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients.  So, it's important to note that while some ways of making refried beans could potentially lead to a less healthy dish, others can result in a nutritious food that can be a healthy part of a balanced diet. Therefore, the categorization of all refried beans as unhealthy would be overly general and ultimately inaccurate.  In conclusion, the health value of refried beans depends on the ingredients and preparation methods used. Therefore, it's not accurate to categorize it as simply healthy or unhealthy. More context would be needed as to how the refried beans are prepared to accurately assess their healthiness. Thus, with the information provided in the paragraph, we can't definitively say whether the hypothesis that refried beans are unhealthy is true or false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Genesis  #39;faulty battery #39; probed A faulty battery has emerged as one of the likeliest causes for the crash-landing of the Genesis space probe. Scientists have been removing pieces of dirt and mud that lodged in the damaged canister after it smashed at high speed into the Utah desert. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the investigation surrounding the crash-landing of the Genesis space probe. It suggests that a faulty battery is being considered as one of the primary reasons for the probe's failure. After crash-landing at high speed into the Utah desert, the probe sustained significant damage, and dirt and mud became lodged in the canister. Scientists have been working on removing these foreign materials, in order to better analyze the events leading to the crash and gain a clearer understanding of the underlying causes.  Genesis, a space probe launched by NASA, had a mission to collect solar wind particles and return them to Earth for further analysis. The spacecraft was equipped with sample collectors in the form of wafers, composed of silicon, sapphire, gold, and diamond. The probe's purpose was to provide insights into solar processes and the formation of our solar system by studying these samples. The mission, unfortunately, ended with the crash-landing of the canister in the Utah desert. Due to the absence of a parachute deployment, Genesis smashed into the ground at an incredibly high speed, damaging the canister and causing it to become contaminated with debris from the crash site. This has complicated the work of scientists further, as they now have to delicately clean and extract the samples to minimize any impact from the debris on their analysis. Despite the crash, some valuable solar wind samples were retrieved from the damaged canister. These samples hold important information on the compositions of the solar wind and can help us to better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system, as well as the processes that govern the sun. In conclusion, the text is about the ongoing investigation into the crash-landing of the Genesis space probe, with a faulty battery being a major probable cause. The incident has impacted scientists' ability to study the collected solar wind samples, but work is being done to clean and extract the samples for analysis. This event emphasizes the importance of reliable technologies and systems in space exploration and the retrieval of vital information that enhances our understanding of the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a title for this article: Philadelphia, PA – Based on his performance in Sunday's STP Gas Booster 500, Jimmie Johnson certainly hasn't lost his touch at Martinsville Speedway. Johnson collected his eighth win at Martinsville, which is the oldest and shortest racetrack on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series schedule. He led 346 of 500 laps and beat Clint Bowyer to the finish line by 0.6 seconds to move up to third on the track's all-time race winners list. Richard Petty has the most victories there with 15, followed by Darrell Waltrip with 11. Johnson not only gave Hendrick Motorsports its 212th win in NASCAR's premier series but its 20th victory at Martinsville as well, which is now more than any other team there. Hendrick had been tied with Petty Enterprises for most wins with 19. Just how good has Johnson been at Martinsville throughout his career? Since his 35th-place finish in April 2002 -- his rookie season in Cup -- Johnson has placed no worse than 12th at this track. The five-time series champion also has led laps in 13 of the last 15 races there. Johnson won the pole position on Friday, which allowed him to select the first pit stall at this 0.525-mile, paperclip-shaped track. He also started on the pole and won there last October. If one thing is true about Martinsville, having that coveted pit stall can be very beneficial. \\"You make your day so much easier when you qualify up front, qualify on pole and get that first pit stall,\\" Johnson said. \\"(Teammate) Jeff (Gordon) sent me a funny text Friday. You're tough enough to beat when you qualify 15th, but on the pole, it's going to be impossible to beat you. I got a good laugh out of that.\\" Gordon, who has won at Martinsville seven times, finished third. \\"(Johnson) is so impressive here, but the thing that impresses me the most are those darn poles,\\" Gordon said. \\"He used to at least give us a shot when he would qualify like 15th. So when those guys get that number one pit stall, they're almost impossible to beat.\\" Johnson, Bowyer and Gordon were running in the top three just before the 12th and final caution set up an eight-lap shootout to the finish. The front end of Kurt Busch's car erupted into flames after he hit the wall, which forced the caution and briefly halted the race for cleanup efforts. Johnson was hoping the end of this race wouldn't be a repeat of last year's spring event at Martinsville. He was denied a victory in that race after he was involved in a crash with Bowyer and Gordon while all three drivers were battling for the lead following a restart in the closing laps. Ryan Newman benefited from the wreck by taking the lead and then picking up the win. \\"I was looking at the scoreboard wondering where Clint was,\\" Johnson said. \\"I expected him to roll right up there with how awesome he was (in Saturday's final practice). And Jeff on the longer run probably had the car to beat. Jeff has a really good line here on the long run, and he started catching me before the last caution, and I was thinking, 'Man, if this stays green, this could be a Jeff Gordon day.' But when the caution came out, I knew it was swinging back my direction, because we had such a good car on the short run.\\" All in all, it was a good day for team owner Rick Hendrick at Martinsville. Hendrick had three of his drivers in the top four, with Kasey Kahne taking the fourth spot. Dale Earnhardt Jr. had been running among the top 10 for most of the race until Danica Patrick made contact with Earnhardt and spun him out with 35 laps to go. Earnhardt entered this race with the points lead, but after his 24th-place run, he fell 12 points behind new leader Johnson. \\"We've been very fortunate to have some great drivers, and this track has been awful good to us,\\" Hendrick said. \\"I'm really proud of these guys and proud of the organization, because they all ran good. \\"(Dale Earnhardt) Junior had some trouble, but I was worried that we were going to end up like we did this race last year when that caution came out, because I didn't know who was going to take tires and who was going to stay out. But it played out, and it's been a great day for us.\\" Martinsville has been a special place for Hendrick. On April 29, 1984, Geoff Bodine gave Hendrick his first win as a car owner in Cup. The victory came in just the team's eighth start. Hendrick founded his racing organization in '84, which was then known as All- Star Racing. There were just five employees, including driver Bodine and crew chief Harry Hyde, at the time. Twenty-nine years ago, Hendrick would've never imagined he would be the all-time winning car owner at Martinsville. \\"I'm guessing Hendrick has got something figured out pretty good here,\\" Gordon said. \\"There's just certain tracks where the drivers that Hendrick has had over the past as well as now and just our race cars, it just really suits that.\\" The series returns to Martinsville the last weekend in October for the seventh race in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.","output":"\\"Jimmie Johnson Secures Eighth Martinsville Victory and Boosts Hendrick Motorsports to Top Team Status\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Background: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below .  Paragraph: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which electron would be closer to the nucleus, cat A or cat B?

The attack, which took place in the heart of the Iraqi capital, targeted a military convoy. Among the fallen heroes was a young soldier who had just arrived at his first deployment in the region. The sudden loss of these brave soldiers underscores the prevailing dangers that military personnel face every day during their service, even as the security situation in Iraq continues to evolve. According to official reports, the US military convoy was en route to a local base when the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) was triggered. These devastating roadside bombs have been a persistent concern for coalition forces in Iraq. The explosion caused extensive damage to the vehicle, fatally wounding four soldiers and injuring several others. One of the fallen soldiers, a young man who was barely 19 years old, had arrived in Baghdad just days before the tragic incident. After enlisting in the military, he was eager to serve his country and contribute to ongoing efforts to stabilize the region. This bright-eyed youth, whose dreams were sadly cut short by the horrific attack, now leaves behind a grieving family and loved ones. The other three victims were seasoned soldiers who had spent several years serving their country on multiple deployments. Having forged strong bonds over time, they remained committed to their mission despite the ever-present danger. These dedicated individuals, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, exemplify the spirit of camaraderie and bravery that defines the US armed forces. In the aftermath of the incident, US military officials are working closely with Iraqi security forces to investigate the appalling attack and to identify those responsible for the cowardly act. As both nations join hands to destabilize terror outfits that continue to plague the region, they remain dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of the people of Iraq. While this tragic event reminds us of the ongoing threats and risks faced by military personnel in conflict-ridden regions, it also highlights the unwavering commitment of US soldiers to serve and protect. The heartbreaking loss of these four brave individuals has undoubtedly left a profound void in the lives of their families, friends, and fellow soldiers. As we mourn the deaths of these courageous servicemen, we must remember to honor their sacrifice and pay tribute to their memories. Their selflessness and dedication to upholding the values of their country serve as an inspiration to all who are called upon to defend the freedoms that we hold dear. In these trying times, it is up to us to support the families of the fallen and do our part in ensuring that the legacy of these brave soldiers continues to be acknowledged and celebrated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The missing first step of the process is as follows: A: The process of respiration begins with inhalation, during which air is drawn into the nasal or oral cavity, depending on whether the person breathes through their nose or mouth. The detailed process is outlined below: 1. Inhalation: The diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, expanding the chest cavity and allowing air to be drawn into the nasal or oral cavity. The nose and mouth act as the initial entry points for air, with the nose responsible for filtering, warming, and humidifying the incoming air. 2. Air enters the trachea: Once air has passed through the nasal or oral cavity, it then moves through the pharynx (throat) and larynx (voice box) and enters the trachea (windpipe). The trachea is responsible for conducting air towards the lungs. 3. Air enters bronchial tubes: The trachea splits into two main bronchi, one entering each lung. Each bronchus further divides into smaller and smaller bronchial tubes within the lungs. 4. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: These smaller bronchial tubes eventually narrow down into even smaller tubes called bronchioles. 5. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: At the end of the bronchioles, there are clusters of small air sacs called alveoli. 6. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels: The walls of the alveoli are thin and porous, allowing for efficient gas exchange with the surrounding networks of capillaries (small blood vessels). 7. Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels: As air fills the alveoli, oxygen molecules diffuse across the thin walls of the alveoli and bind to red blood cells within the capillaries. This oxygen-rich blood is then transported away from the lungs towards the heart. 8. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the heart and is pumped out to the rest of the body through the circulatory system to supply oxygen to tissues and cells. 9. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: As oxygen is delivered to cells, carbon dioxide—a waste product of cellular respiration—is picked up by red blood cells and transported back to the lungs via the circulatory system. 10. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: Upon returning to the lungs, carbon dioxide diffuses across the alveolar walls and into the alveoli. It is then expelled from the body as you exhale, completing the respiratory process."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine the answer, let's analyze the properties of both objects step by step. Step 1: Understand the properties of a concrete slab and a rubber sheet. - A concrete slab is a solid, rigid, and brittle material. - A rubber sheet is an elastic, flexible, and resilient material. Step 2: Analyze the behavior of both materials when subjected to bending. - When a concrete slab is bent, it cannot absorb or distribute the force applied due to its rigid nature. Thus, it is likely to crack or break. - When a rubber sheet is bent, it can absorb and distribute the force applied due to its flexible nature. It can return to its original shape without breaking. Step 3: Compare the likelihood of breaking between the two materials. - The concrete slab is more likely to break when bent as it is rigid and cannot easily absorb or distribute force. - The rubber sheet is less likely to break when bent as it is flexible and can easily absorb and distribute force.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Hi there, this is Vani Hari from Food Babe. I recently discovered that several American products are using harmful additives that are not used – and in some cases banned – in other countries. One of those products is an iconic staple that almost every American, us included, has had at one time or another: Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.      Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the US contains the artificial food dyes Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. These unnecessary – yet potentially harmful - dyes are not in Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in other countries, including the UK, because they were removed due to consumer outcry. Kraft reformulated their product for the UK, but not for their fellow American citizens.      It’s time we demand the same here in the US!      Note: Yellow 5 (labeled asTartrazine) is also used in these products in Canada, and I'm sure they don't want to have it in their food either!      That's why I'm petitioning Kraft to remove all dangerous artificial food dyes from their line of macaroni and cheese.      Here are the reasons I'm asking Kraft to remove Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 from their Macaroni and Cheese.      Artificial food dyes...      - Are man-made in a lab with chemicals derived from petroleum (a crude oil product, which also happens to be used in gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt, and tar).      - Require a warning label in other countries outside the US.      - Have been banned in countries like Norway and Austria (and are being phased out in the UK).      - Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 are contaminated with known carcinogens (a.k.a. an agent directly involved in causing cancer).      - Cause an increase in hyperactivity in children.      - Have a negative impact on children’s ability to learn.      - Have been linked to long-term health problems such as asthma, skin rashes, and migraines.      - Add absolutely no nutritional value to the foods we are eating and are solely used for aesthetic purposes only.      To prove this last point I personally tested both the US and UK versions of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and found virtually no difference in color or taste (see the video above).      I grew up eating this product, and it’s available at almost every grocery store across the country.      Everyone deserves the same safer version that our friends get overseas!      Kraft Foods is the largest food company headquartered in the United States. If Kraft changes their Macaroni and Cheese, I know this could inspire other food companies across the US to finally eliminate dangerous artificial food dyes once and for all.      Join me now and sign this petition. Together we can make a difference. ||||| Kraft says it plans to remove artificial dyes from three macaroni and cheese varieties that come in kid-friendly shapes, a move that comes as people increasingly reach for foods they feel are natural.      The change doesn't affect Kraft's plain elbow-shaped macaroni and cheese with \\"original flavor.\\"      The packaged-food company, which also makes Oscar Mayer and Jell-O, said the revamped recipes aren't a response to a petition on Change.org that asked it to remove artificial dyes from its famous macaroni and cheese kits. That petition, which was posted in March, had more than 348,000 signatures on Thursday.      Kraft's new recipes, which begin shipping early next year, will be for its macaroni and cheese varieties that come in the SpongeBob Squarepants, Halloween and winter shapes. Two new shapes will also be added.      The company said it plans to replace the artificial dyes with spices such as paprika for coloring.      Ingredients in packaged food have come under greater scrutiny in recent years. People are increasingly trying to eat foods they feel are better for them, and big food makers are adjusting their offerings to keep pace.      In the meantime, smaller players such as Annie's Homegrown Inc., which makes a variety of macaroni and cheese, are getting more shelf space at the supermarket.      Earlier this year, PepsiCo also said it would remove a controversial ingredient from its Gatorade sports drink because of customer complaints. The move came after a petition by a Mississippi teenager on Change.org, although PepsiCo said the petition wasn't what prompted its decision.      Triona Schmelter, Kraft Food Group Inc.'s vice president of marketing for meals, said the company was looking to improve the nutritional profiles of the three macaroni and cheese varieties more broadly. The new recipes will also add whole grains and reduce the amount of sodium and saturated fat, she said.      She declined to specify whether Kraft would eventually make similar changes to its other macaroni and cheese lines. But she noted the company already offers options that only use natural colors, such as several of its \\"Homestyle\\" varieties.      \\"We'll continue to make improvement where we can,\\" Schmelter said, noting that the company tries to cater to evolving customer preferences.      Vani Hari, who started the petition on Change.org and runs the website FoodBabe.com, said she expects Kraft will remove artificial dyes from other products down the road.      \\"I knew all along that it wasn't going to be an overnight change,\\" said Hari, who is based in Charlotte, N.C. \\"This is a big corporation, and this is one of their biggest products.\\"      ____________      Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| A campaign to get the artificial yellow dye out of Kraft's Mac and Cheese claimed a victory today after the company announced its plans to pull the coloring from at least three of its kid-friendly boxes in the United States and Canada.      The change doesn't affect Kraft's plain elbow-shaped macaroni and cheese with \\"original flavor,\\" according to the Associated Press. But it will affect its new recipes, which will available next year: SpongeBob SquarePants, Halloween and winter shapes. Two new shapes will also be added.      The new natural color will come from spices such as paprika, according to Triona Schmelter, Kraft Food Group Inc.'s vice president of marketing meals. It will also contain more whole grains and less sodium and saturated fat.      \\"We'll continue to make improvement where we can,\\" Schmelter told the AP.      Moms tell Kraft to take out food dyes.      Company officials said, however, their decision was not in response to the petition that was launched on Change.org and has garnered more than 348,000 signatures.      Two North Carolina bloggers, Lisa Leake and Vani Hari, launched the petition last March and confronted Kraft executives.      Today, only Hari, who blogs at Food Babe, continues the fight.      \\"I was so shaken with the news that my body was trembling,\\" she told ABCNews.com today. \\"I have been fighting so hard for these 348,000 people, being their voice.\\"      Hari, 34, delivered the signatures to Kraft headquarters last spring and said she \\"continues to keep the pressure on\\" through her writing and getting others to call corporate headquarters and \\"waging a war\\" on Facebook.      \\"I have built an army of people concerned about food and not only what their families are eating, but all of America,\\" Hari said.      She has been worried about the additives -- yellow dye 5 and yellow dye 6, which she said added nothing to the flavor and may be dangerous to kids' health.      Hari did some investigating and found that Kraft makes the same Mac and Cheese for its consumers in the United Kingdom, but because of stricter rules regarding additives, it is dye-free. There, Kraft uses natural beta carotene and paprika to make it almost the same color.      She said she was inspired by Missouri teenager Sarah Kavanagh's Change.org petition that pressured Gatorade to stop using brominated vegetable oil and Houston healthy food advocate Bettina Siegal's Change.org petition to take \\"pink slime\\" out of school lunches.      11 Foods Banned Outside the U.S. That We Eat      The news from Kraft comes as another mom, Renee Shutters from New York, has launched a petition on Change.org calling on Mars to remove artificial dyes from M&M;'s candy. It has gone viral, with more than 100,000 signatures, just in time for Halloween.      Hari and Leake said that the yellow dye serves only \\"aesthetic purposes\\" and worried that food colorings have been associated with hyperactivity in children, allergies, migraine and, because yellow dyes are petroleum-based, maybe cancer.      The women taste-tested the two versions of Mac and Cheese and posted it on YouTube. They said they found \\"virtually no difference\\" in color or taste. Leake said her children actually liked the U.K. version better.      Leake and Hari say in their petition that in addition to hyperactivity, these dyes can have a \\"negative impact on children's ability to learn.\\"      Some countries require warning labels on products that contain color additives, according to Hari, who writes the blog Food Babe. \\"That's the reason why companies are phasing out dyes,\\" she said.      In the United States, \\"we have this precautionary principle,\\" she said. \\"We have to go through crazy, rigorous things to prove harm, rather than safety.\\"      Both yellow dyes in question are fully legal and approved by the FDA, which is responsible for food safety. More than 3,000 additives are approved for food.      \\"Today, food and color additives are more strictly studied, regulated and monitored than at any other time in history,\\" the FDA states on its website about the topic.      To market a new food or color additive, a manufacturer or other sponsor must first petition the FDA for its approval. Since 1999, indirect additives have been approved by a pre-market notification process requiring the same data as was previously required by petition.      But Leake and Hari cited a 68-page report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, \\"Food Dyes: A Rainbow of Risks,\\" which outlines various studies on the health effects of food coloring.      The center was founded by scientists when consumer and environmental protection awareness was growing in 1971. It advocates for nutrition and health, food safety and alcohol policy.      The report was based on government studies from the National Toxicology Program and recommends removing yellow dye 6 from the market.      Both dyes used in the Kraft product contain benzidine 4-amino-buphenyl, a man-made product derived from petroleum. In a \\"too brief\\" mouse study, yellow dye 5 showed risks of hyperactivity in children, according to the report; yellow dye 6 was associated with adrenal and testicular tumors and no studies were done in utero. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something.

Information:  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - William Craig ( November 13 , 1918 -- January 13 , 2016 ) was an American academic and philosopher , who taught at the University of California , Berkeley , in Berkeley , California . His research interests included mathematical logic , and the philosophy of science , and he is best known for the Craig interpolation theorem .  - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - First-order logic  also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic  is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers.  - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:  - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula  implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in  occurs both in  and ,  implies , and  implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem.  - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.  - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System.  - Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy investigating the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions:  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape.   - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those.  - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\".   - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory.  - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics.  - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world.  - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering.  - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.  - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.

Can we infer the following?  A Member is doing something inherently connected with a \`\`proceeding in Parliament'' when putting down a question on the Order Paper. No-one in Parliament is elected except the speaker.","output":"The concept of \\"proceedings in Parliament\\" refers to activities that take place within the context of the legislative assembly. This includes various actions such as debating, voting, submitting motions, amendments or bills, and even working internally with parliamentary committees or parliamentary services. The aim of parliamentary proceedings is to ensure that the legislative assembly functions effectively and efficiently through a democratic process. Concerning the first inference, it is accurate to deduce that a Member is doing something inherently connected to a \\"proceeding in Parliament\\" while putting down a question on the Order Paper. An Order Paper is an official agenda that outlines the process of Parliament, including the scheduling of debates, motions, questions, and several other elements relevant to parliamentary activities. By submitting a question on the Order Paper, the Member is participating in the procedures that constitute the ongoing proceedings in Parliament. This contribution adds to the overall structure and function of the legislative assembly which aims to adequately represent the citizens they serve. However, the second part of the inference - \\"No-one in Parliament is elected except the speaker\\" - is incorrect, as it does not take into account the nature of parliamentary democracies. In a parliamentary system, Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected representatives of their constituencies through a democratic process. In most cases, these MPs serve in the legislative assembly, known as Parliament. They may belong to a range of political parties or be independent, and their primary goal is to pass laws and address concerns relevant to their constituents and the nation as a whole. The Speaker of the Parliament is also an elected individual, serving as the impartial presiding officer of the legislative assembly. The Speaker's duty is to maintain order, enforce parliamentary procedural rules, interpret parliamentary laws, and ensure debates and discussions are handled in a fair and unbiased manner. The Speaker is typically elected at the commencement of a new Parliament session or following the retirement or resignation of a sitting Speaker, and it is not uncommon for them to be re-elected if they perform well in their role. In conclusion, the first part of the inference regarding a Member's connection to a \\"proceeding in Parliament\\" when putting down a question on the Order Paper is accurate. However, the second part, claiming that no one is elected aside from the speaker, is incorrect. Instead, Members of Parliament, including the Speaker, are elected representatives who collectively contribute to the proceedings and decision-making processes of the parliamentary system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Bears were penalized on the play and Adams was taken off the field on a stretcher. (Matt Ludtke/AP)      The NFL is reviewing the hit delivered by Chicago Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan on Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams during Thursday night’s game at Lambeau Field for potential discipline, possibly a suspension.      That review was underway Friday morning.      “There have already been discussions …. I don’t have a decision yet on whether discipline will be handed down,” said Joe Lockhart, the NFL’s executive vice president of communications and public affairs.      According to the league, Adams suffered a concussion and spent the night in a hospital.      [From Freddie Gray through Ray Lewis, Baltimore is at the center of NFL anthem debate]      Trevathan was penalized for a helmet-to-helmet hit, delivered as Adams was being tackled by Adrian Amos after a catch. He was not ejected from the game by officials. The league can follow up with a fine or suspension after its review.      The NFL enacted a directive by its rulemaking competition committee in the offseason calling for ejections and suspensions for the most egregious of illegal hits, even on a first offense.      Lockhart said the league is withholding judgment for now on whether it believes Trevathan should have been ejected.      “I want to let the process run its course,” he said. “I will tell you our commitment to this [player-safety measures] is the same as it was yesterday.”      Mike Pereira, the NFL’s former vice president of officiating and now a rules analyst for Fox, wrote on Twitter: “That[‘]s the first time I have seen the foul called for hitting the runner with the crown of the helmet. I would eject him now.”      Dean Blandino, the other former NFL officiating chief who now works for Fox, wrote on Twitter that he “won’t be surprised” if Trevathan is suspended.      [From March: NFL enacting proposal for ejections, suspensions for certain illegal hits]      The NFL suspended Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, a repeat offender, for an illegal hit during the preseason. Burfict’s suspension originally was for five games but was reduced to three on appeal.      Players on the field immediately waved for the medical staff to come out to assist Adams. Adams gave a thumbs-up signal before leaving the field. He was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation and the Packers said later that he was conscious and had movement in his extremities.

Packers, Bears and some Green Bay fans link arms after Trump continues attacks on NFL players ||||| As Packers receiver Davante Adams lay motionless on the Lambeau Field grass late Thursday night, Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan felt both concerned and remorseful. It was Trevathan’s hit — a crushing helmet-to-helmet shot at the end of an 8-yard reception — that sent Adams’ mouthpiece flying and temporarily knocked the receiver out.      A worried silence enveloped Lambeau Field as medical personnel rushed to Adams’ aid and eventually took him off the field on a stretcher. The Packers receiver was immediately transported to a local hospital to undergo testing for head and neck injuries. He was conscious and had movement in his extremities as he left the stadium, the Packers said.      Still, Trevathan felt his worry spike when he saw Adams on the ground. The Bears linebacker said he didn’t realize immediately how vicious his hit had been.      “I realized it once he laid there for a while,” Trevathan said. “I saw his mouthpiece over there on the other side and he wasn’t moving and I saw his fingers twitching. I knew it wasn’t good. I just immediately dropped down and started praying.”      Replays of Trevathan’s hit proved jarring. As safety Adrian Amos held Adams up near the Bears 10-yard line, Trevathan came from away from the play and blasted the Packers receiver. The crown of Trevathan’s helmet smashed into Adams’ head.      The hit left a stain on the Bears’ 35-14 loss and triggered an impassioned debate on whether the blow had been dirty or not.      “I was just trying to make a play,” Trevathan asserted. “It wasn’t intentional. I was just trying to hustle to the ball and do my job. Unfortunately, he wound up hurt. I’m sorry about that. And I’m going to reach out to him and try to send him a message. We play a physical game. But you never wish that on anybody.”      Trevathan was asked after the game whether he regretted the hit after seeing it on replay.      “I regret just the level I hit him at,” he said. “I could have been a little better. But you have to understand I was (gathering) momentum and I was just trying to make a play. Nothing intentional. It happens in this game.”      Trevathan will undoubtedly face a stiff fine from the league office for the hit. And there will be serious discussions about a possible suspension, a scenario Trevathan was bracing for late Thursday.      >> Analysis: Danny Trevathan's hit on Davante Adams shows NFL needs college football's targeting rule      “We’ll see,” he said. “I don’t think it should be a suspension. But you never know. I’m going to send a prayer out. My main concern is that he’s OK. ... It was bad. I never wish that on anybody. Especially after being hurt (myself) a few times, I know how that is. And especially with the head and the neck, you never wish that on anybody. You never want to see that.”      The Bears linebacker said he planned to reach out to Adams through Twitter and through Packers receiver Randall Cobb, a college teammate of Trevathan’s at Kentucky.      “He knows what type of player I am,” Trevathan said. “I don’t wish bad on anybody. But I’m going to play lights out and I’m trying to create havoc as a linebacker. But I don’t wish that on anybody.”      Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers took exception to Bears players celebrating the hit on Adams initially. Rodgers also spoke at length with Trevathan on the field.      “I trust when Danny said that he wasn’t trying to him like that,” Rodgers said. “He is one of the hardest hitting players in the NFL. ... I don’t think he was intentionally trying to hurt (Davante). But he did give him a good whack and unfortunately ‘Te got knocked out.”      Packers safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix took greater exception.      “When you see a defenseless guy and he takes a hit by a guy who is running full speed, it’s sad,” Clinton-Dix said. “We play the game for a living and we don’t want a guy to go out like that.”      Trevathan was flagged for unnecessary roughness but not ejected after the hit. Referee John Hussey explained that decision.      “From my perspective,” Hussey said, “I just didn’t see enough to have it rise to that level. That issue I would say is a judgment call. Was it egregious? Was it completely unnecessary? I didn’t have enough information from my perspective to make it that.”      Trevathan had support from his own team at the end of the night.      “I know it wasn’t (dirty). I saw it,” defensive end Akiem Hicks said. “I told Danny, ‘You were just playing football. You were trying to make noise and bang pads and stuff that we’re asked to do.’ I know there was no malicious intent behind it. He was just playing the game he’s been playing since he was a young man.”      Added Bears coach John Fox: “None of this is intentional. You never want to see any (player) hurt – yours or theirs. None of these guys are out there trying to hurt each other. It is a physical game. I didn’t see it that close. From what I’ve heard, (Adams) is hopefully going to be OK.”      dwiederer@chicagotribune.com      Twitter @danwiederer ||||| Green Bay Packers' Davante Adams is hit by Chicago Bears' Adrian Amos and Danny Trevathan during the second half of an NFL football game Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017, in Green Bay, Wis. The Bears were penalized... (Associated Press)      GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Two more key players hurt. A starting cornerback benched. The Green Bay Packers even had to weather a lightning storm delay.      But they just keep finding ways to win.      Aaron Rodgers threw four short touchdown passes, and the injury-riddled Packers converted three of Bears quarterback Mike Glennon's four turnovers into scores in an eventful 35-14 victory over mistake-prone Chicago on Thursday night.      Rodgers connected with Davante Adams and Randall Cobb on short touchdown passes to help build a 21-0 lead in the second quarter of a game delayed 45 minutes by lightning between the first two periods. The Packers overpowered the Bears down the stretch to slog out a win as intermittent rain fell at Lambeau Field.      \\"This was a big character win for us,\\" Rodgers said.      The already-depleted Packers (3-1) lost starting running back Ty Montgomery to a rib injury in the first quarter. Adams left the field on a stretcher after getting hit in the head during a tackle by Danny Trevathan in the third quarter.      The game was delayed for about 5 minutes while medical personnel tended to the receiver, who gave a thumbs-up signal as he was wheeled off the field. The Packers said Adams was conscious and taken to a hospital for evaluation for possible head and neck injuries, and that he had feeling in all of his extremities.      \\"The news I was given on Davante — everything looks positive. That's a great sign,\\" McCarthy said.      Known as a hard hitter, Trevathan said the hit wasn't intentional. He was whistled for unnecessary roughness.      \\"I'm sorry about that and you know I'm going to reach out to him and try to send him a message,\\" Trevathan said, \\"because you know you play a physical game, but you never wish that on nobody.\\"      Other notes and takeaways from the game:      BEARS QB: With two fumbles and two interceptions, Glennon did little to quiet the calls from Bears fans to give No. 2 overall pick Mitchell Trubisky a try at quarterback. Glennon did finish 21 of 33 for 218 yards, but the Bears never recovered from his awful start. He fumbled on his first snap on a strip sack by linebacker Clay Matthews.      The Bears next play on Oct. 9 against Minnesota.      \\"We'll evaluate everything and we've got a lot of work to do before we line up against Minnesota,\\" Fox said. \\"We're going to look at everything.\\"      PACKERS OL: The Packers' patchwork offensive line held up well and allowed just two sacks. That was impressive given that Green Bay essentially fielded a starting five of four guards and center Corey Linsley. Lane Taylor, normally a left guard, made his first start at left tackle with David Bakhtiari (hamstring) sidelined. Right tackle Bryan Bulaga (ankle) also missed the game.      Rodgers was 18 of 26 for 179 yards.      BENCHED: Packers starting cornerback Damarious Randall was benched in the second half for an undisclosed issue. He barely moved on the Bears' opening series after halftime, his arms outstretched at each side while sitting on the sideline.      McCarthy said it was an \\"internal matter and we're working through it.\\" At one point, cornerback Davon House, who was not active because of a quad injury, sat down next to Randall on the bench.      \\"Just to shake it off, it's all part of the game as a cornerback,\\" House said about his message to Randall.      NATIONAL ANTHEM: Players, coaches and other staffers on each team locked arms on their respective sidelines during the national anthem. Packers players released a statement this week saying they would intertwine arms before the game as a show of unity. They asked fans to join in the stands and at home, though it didn't appear that many fans locked arms. Many people in the crowd held up small flags during and after the anthem.      Rodgers said he was proud of his team, and that that issue was a \\"galvanizing situation\\" for the locker room.      \\"We could hear some USA chants as it started, which is fantastic. Could also hear some negativity being yelled during the anthem,\\" Rodgers said. \\"What's disrespectful to the anthem? Yelling things during it, or standing at attention with arms locked, facing the flag? That's for you to decide.\\"      MILESTONES: The Packers are 95-94-6 against the Bears, their first lead in the series since 1933. It's the oldest rivalry in football, dating to 1923. ... Matthews' sack on Glennon in the first quarter was the 75th of his career, breaking the franchise record since 1982 held by Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila.      ___      For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL ||||| But it was a scary moment the league will notice      GREEN BAY – This was good to hear.      “The news I’ve been given on Davante so far is everything looks positive,” Head Coach Mike McCarthy said of receiver Davante Adams , who was taken off Lambeau Field on a stretcher after a nasty hit from Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan.      “He’s already giving them a hard time at the hospital to get out of there, so that’s a great sign.”      It sure is, and it makes it easier to celebrate the Packers’ 35-14 victory Thursday night knowing Adams apparently is going to be OK.      It didn’t look that way when Trevathan lowered the boom on Adams in the red zone. With his momentum stopped by other Bears defenders after a short reception, Adams absorbed a powerful helmet-to-helmet blow from Trevathan that sent Adams’ mouthguard flying and briefly knocked him out.      Teammates Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson were immediately, and frantically, waving medical personnel onto the field to tend to Adams. The loudest noise in the press box all night came from the gasps and groans when the replay was shown.      Adams was taken to a local hospital to be evaluated for head and neck injuries, but he was conscious with feeling and movement in all his extremities when he left the field.      “It’s really tough to see your teammate not able to move,” quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. “You could tell he was in a bad place, in a bad way.      “That’s never easy, whether it’s a guy like Malachi (Dupre), who you spend only a few weeks with, or a guy like Nick Collins who you win a Super Bowl with and you’re drafted in the same class. It’s tough.”      Rodgers exchanged harsh words with some of the Bears on the field afterward, saying he didn’t like to see any celebrating when a player is carted off.      He gave Trevathan the benefit of the doubt, though, after hearing how the linebacker was pleading his case with the officials.      “I trust when Danny said he wasn’t intentionally trying to hit him like that,” Rodgers said. “He is one of the hardest-hitting players in the NFL. He made a hit on one of our guys last year in the hole that was one of the hardest hits I’ve ever heard.      “But I don’t think he was intentionally trying to hurt ’Tae.”      Nelson didn’t attack Trevathan, either. He only wished the play had been whistled dead sooner, because forward progress was clearly stopped.      One play after Adams was wheeled off, Nelson caught his second touchdown of the game and went to a knee in the end zone.      “That definitely was for ’Tae,” Nelson said. “Obviously, we said some prayers while he was laying there. Just another opportunity to do it. It’s not fun to see your brother laying there motionless like that, and being that close is scary.”      For his part, Trevathan told reporters after the game he wasn’t intentionally trying to hit Adams the way he did. He said he planned to reach out to Adams and send him a message.      “You never wish that on nobody,” Trevathan said. “My main concern is that he’s OK.”      His words won’t stop him from getting fined and possibly suspended, though. A new rule allows for suspensions for first offenses on egregious hits, so how the NFL reacts to Trevathan’s hit will be watched closely, especially after he led with the crown of his helmet.      The only punishment administered on the field was a personal foul, which ended up costing the Bears just four yards, half the distance to the goal at the time. One look at the replay had many observers wondering how Trevathan wasn’t ejected from the game.      The giant disparity in those thoughts raises the question whether the NFL will sometime soon adopt a “targeting” rule for immediate ejections like in college, or at least make significant player-safety violations subject to on-the-spot replay review.      Instead, players, coaches and fans alike will wait perhaps days for a disciplinary ruling on a hit that made everybody cringe in an instant.      Adams may get home from the hospital sooner than expected, but the hit he took will have a longer shelf life. How long could depend on just how badly the NFL wants those hits out of the game.      McCarthy said conversations about possible rule changes are for the offseason. If those talks indeed take place next spring, Trevathan’s hit will almost certainly be at the center of the discussions.            Complete game coverage: ||||| The NFL has a new tool to suspend Chicago Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan for the brutal hit he put on Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams on Thursday night. If it isn't used in this instance, then it's fair to wonder when it ever will be used.      During the offseason, the NFL competition committee announced that certain illegal hits, previously punishable by a 15-yard penalty, would be subject to immediate ejection and/or suspension on first offense. At the time, NFL executive vice president Troy Vincent said the league wants to eliminate hits that he termed \\"catastrophic\\" by employing the maximum level of deterrence.      It's hard to find a better word to describe what Trevathan did in the third quarter Thursday night. Multiple Bears defenders had Adams wrapped up inside the red zone when Trevathan lowered his head and hit the front of Adams' face hard enough to send his mouthpiece flying. It was both an illegal hit and an exceptionally dirty one, considering Adams was no longer making forward progress.      Danny Trevathan's hit to the helmet of Davante Adams didn't get him ejected Thursday night, but stronger punishment could be coming for the Bears linebacker. AP Photo/Matt Ludtke      Packers players immediately called for medical assistance as Adams lay motionless on the field. (The team later reported that Adams was conscious and had movement in all extremities en route to a hospital.)      Referee John Hussey issued a 15-yard penalty for what he called a \\"hit to the head.\\" More specifically, he probably meant an illegal hit with the crown of the helmet. Regardless, Hussey should receive strong NFL scrutiny for his failure to eject Trevathan on the spot.      The NFL has no rule mandating an ejection in those circumstances, but it gives referees the discretion to do so when a \\"flagrant\\" foul occurs. In Week 1, for example, referee John Parry ejected Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane because he thought Lane had thrown a punch. In the NFL rule book, \\"flagrant\\" is defined as \\"extremely objectionable, conspicuous, unnecessary, avoidable or gratuitous.\\"      Thursday's dark episode is precisely what the NFL was trying to address with its offseason initiative. I would be stunned if Trevathan is eligible to play in the Bears' next game, scheduled for Oct. 9 against the Minnesota Vikings. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved (and eaten), and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and an unexpected visitor that comes up through the sewer access point that she unfortunately decides to open in the basement of her apartment building. Then, through the dangerous investigative efforts of both A.J. and George, the absolute horror is revealed: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is directly involved in the slaughter that has been...

A:","output":"The Great British Baking Show, also known as The Great British Bake Off, is a popular British television baking competition in which a group of talented amateur bakers compete in a series of themed challenges to test their baking skills and creativity. Each week, one contestant is eliminated based on their performance in a Signature Bake, a Technical Challenge, and a Showstopper Challenge, as judged by a panel of expert bakers.  The winner of Season 2, which aired in 2011 on BBC Two, is Joanne Wheatley. Joanne is a passionate home baker and mother of three from Essex, England. Throughout the competition, Joanne showcased her impressive technical skills, creativity, and eye for detail. She earned consistent praise from judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood for her superb bakes and balanced flavors, quickly establishing herself as a serious contender for the title. In the final episode of Season 2, Joanne faced off against the other two finalists, Holly Bell and Mary-Anne Boermans, in a tense and closely contested championship round. The final challenges consisted of the following: 1. Signature Bake: The finalists were asked to prepare savory petits fours. 2. Technical Challenge: The bakers were tasked with making a Fraisier cake. 3. Showstopper Challenge: Each competitor had to bake a themed chocolate cake, large enough to serve at least 15 people. In the end, Joanne's impressive performance in all three challenges of the final, including her stunning chocolate cornucopia Showstopper, won her the title of The Great British Baking Show Season 2 champion.

Information:  - The Democratic Alliance (AD), originally called Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), was a French political party (19011978) created in 1901 by followers of Léon Gambetta, such as Raymond Poincaré who would be president of the Council in the 1920s. The party was at first conceived by members of the Radical-Socialist Party tied to the business world who united themselves in May 1901, along with many moderates, as gathering center-left liberals and \\"Opportunist\\" Republicans (Gambetta, etc.). However, after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists, it quickly became the main center-right party of the Third Republic. It was part of the National Bloc right-wing coalition which won the elections after the end of the war. The ARD successively took the name \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique\\" (Democratic Republican Party, PRD) then \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique et Social\\" (\\"Social and Republican Democratic Party\\"), before becoming again the AD.  - Léon Gambetta (2 April 1838  31 December 1882) was a French statesman, prominent during and after the Franco-Prussian War.  - The Democratic and Social Action ( French : Action démocratique et sociale , ADS ) was a French parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies of France during the French Third Republic between 1928 and 1932 . The group was formed by the right - wing ( bourgeois and industrialist wing according to André Siegfried ) of the Democratic Republican Alliance , later Democratic Alliance . A number of ADS deputies were formerly members of the most left - wing faction of the Republican Federation , the main conservative party in France which they had left due to the Federation 's evolution to the right . The ADS was resurrected in 1949 by members of the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance ( UDSR ) who joined the Gaullist Rally of the French People ( RPF ) .  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - André Siegfried (April 21, 1875  March 28, 1959) was a French academic, geographer and political writer best known for his commentaries on American, Canadian, and British politics.  - The Republican Federation (FR) was the largest conservative party during the French Third Republic, gathering together the liberal Orleanists rallied to the Republic. Founded in November 1903, it competed with the more secular and centrist \\"Alliance démocratique\\" (Democratic Alliance). Later, most deputies of the \\"Fédération républicaine\\" and of \\"Action libérale\\" (which included Catholics rallied to the Republic) joined the \\"Entente républicaine démocratique\\" right-wing parliamentary group.  - Vichy (is a city in the Allier department of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in central France, in the historic province of Bourbonnais.  - Raymond Nicolas Landry Poincaré (20 August 1860  15 October 1934) was a French statesman who served three times as Prime Minister of France, and as President of France from 1913 to 1920. He was a conservative leader, primarily committed to political and social stability.  - The French Third Republic (sometimes written as \\"\\") was the system of government adopted in France from 1870, when the Second French Empire collapsed, until 1940, when France's defeat by Nazi Germany in World War II led to the formation of the Vichy government in France. It came to an end on 10 July 1940.   - The Second French Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.

I am disappointed to report that Wasabi offered sub-par sushi and even worse cooked items.   My judgement of a sushi restaurant's quality of sushi comes in the tasting of two different types of nigiri. The first always being tamago as it is the piece with the lowest payoff for a sushi restaurant (if they take pride in their sushi, they will do the tamago correctly). The second is going to be a well textured, but very delicate cut of fish (on this day it was halibut). The tamago was presented fallen over and was overly sweet with a \\"frozen\\" taste to it. The halibut was not even prepared correctly, there was no grated yuzu (I may be asking for too much at this point) and no salt on the on the fish (you do not use soy sauce for a fish like halibut). The fish itself did not have a clean flavor and an off-putting texture. Finally, the most unforgiving of sins against sushi that Wasabi commits is their packing of sushi. Sushi rice is not to be packed so tight as you are supposed to dip the sushi FISH SIDE DOWN. I am sorry to say that grocery store sushi is better than the offerings here.   We then had the calamari appetizer. I don't even know where to begin here. Calamari should not be like onion rings (in other words, the batter should not fall off of the squid like an onion ring. Utterly disappointing.   Finally, we ended with the unagi dinner. The fillets of eel were obviously pre-frozen/pre-cooked, drenched in eel sauce, served atop a bed of rice that could feed a family of five, and also contained bones. The side to this dish was not the usual fresh or pickled vegetables that one would find traditionally used to cut the richness of properly prepared unagi, but was instead limp and bitter sauteed cabbage.  All in all, this was a very disappointing meal and I would be embarrassed to serve this food and call it \\"Japanese.\\" I rarely ever give out 1 star, but usually 1-star reviews go to venues that have rats and cockroaches. I'll just say that this is barely a step above a 1-star venue. Is this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is negative.

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic.

The Navarrese Civil War of 1451-1455 pitted John II of the Kingdom of Navarre against his son and heir-apparent, Charles IV. When the war started, John II had been King of Navarre since 1425 through his first wife, Blanche I of Navarre, who had married him in 1420. By the marriage pact of 1419, John and Blanche's eldest son was to succeed to Navarre on Blanche's death. When Blanche died in 1441, John retained the government of her lands and dispossessed his own eldest son, Charles , who was made Prince of Viana in 1423. John tried to assuage his son with the lieutenancy of Navarre, but his son's French upbringing and French allies, the Beaumonteses, brought the two into conflict. John was supported by the Agramonteses. From 1451 to 1455, they were engaged in open warfare in Navarre. Charles was defeated at the Battle of Aybar in 1452, captured, and released; and John tried to disinherit him by illegally naming his daughter Eleanor, who was married to Gaston IV of Foix, his successor. In 1451, John's new wife, Juana Enríquez, gave birth to a son, Ferdinand. In 1452, Charles fled his father first to France, where vainly sought allies, and later to the court of his uncle, John's elder brother, Alfonso V at Naples. Charles was popular in Spain and John was increasingly unpopular as he refused to recognise Charles as his \\"first born\\", probably planning to make Ferdinand his heir.

The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters.

His parents divorced when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: \\"He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk to me about dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me.\\" In 2006, Kapoor played opposite Kareena Kapoor in two films--the thriller 36 China Town and the comedy Chup Chup Ke. In 36 China Town, a murder mystery from the director duo Abbas-Mustan, Kapoor starred as one of the seven suspects in the murder of an heiress, and in the Priyadarshan-directed Chup Chup Ke, he played a depressed man who pretends to be deaf and mute. The former was his first commercial success since Ishq Vishk. Greater success came to Kapoor later that year when he starred alongside Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya's romantic drama Vivah, a film depicting an arranged marriage. Made on a shoestring budget of Rs100 million (US1.5 million), the film earned over Rs530 million (US8.1 million) worldwide, and proved to be Kapoor's highest-grossing film to that point. Reviews of the film, however, were negative; Raja Sen termed the film a \\"nightmare\\" and wrote that Kapoor \\"isn't offensively bad, doesn't ham it up like crazy, or speak in a weird accent. Having said that, he isn't an actor at all, standing around working on his boyish grin, simply chewing up the scenery. No screen presence at all.\\"  Kapoor found no success in his first release of 2007--the ensemble comedy Fool & Final. However, his second release that year, the Imtiaz Ali-directed romantic comedy Jab We Met proved to be one of the top-grossing films of the year. The film tells the story of a troubled businessman (Kapoor) whose life undergoes a series of changes after he encounters a loquacious girl (Kareena Kapoor) on a train ride. Ali thought that Kapoor's previous roles failed to justify his acting potential, and thus approached him to portray a more complex character. The BBC noted on how \\"endearing\\" he was in the film and Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote that he left an \\"indelible impression with a performance that is understated and mature\\" in a film he thought primarily belonged to Kareena Kapoor. For his performance, Kapoor received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.  After featuring opposite Vidya Balan in the romantic comedy Kismat Konnection (2008), Kapoor played twin brothers, one with a lisp and the other with a stutter, in Vishal Bhardwaj's critically acclaimed caper thriller Kaminey (2009). In preparation, Kapoor met speech specialists and researched on the medical and mental aspects of the two conditions. To create a lean physique for one of the brothers, a look he considered to be \\"radically different\\" from his personal appearance, Kapoor practiced functional training and followed a rigorous diet. Writing for Variety, critic Joe Leydon reviewed that Kapoor \\"impressively displays sufficiently variegated degrees of emotional intensity to sustain the illusion of two distinct characters. Just as important, he provides each sibling an appropriately elevated hunkiness quotient.\\" Rediff.com listed Kapoor's performance as the best by a Bollywood actor in 2009 and he received a second Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. Kaminey earned over Rs700 million (US11 million) worldwide. Kapoor's final release of 2009 was as a cricketer in Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy co-starring Rani Mukerji. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, but was a financial failure.

This is a 1000-fold increase in the acidity of the solution. For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them. Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH. Commercial buffer solutions, which have a wide variety of pH values, can be obtained.  Now, I have a new situation: John is a scientist in a large pharmaceutical company. He devices many useful products using his knowledge of chemistry. Today, he has four solutions in front of him, solution A, solution B, solution C, and solution D.

Movie plot title: Primal Fear Movie plot: Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a Chicago defense attorney who loves the public spotlight and does everything he can to get his high-profile clients acquitted on legal technicalities. One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell. When this incident is over, Aaron's personality re-emerges and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch. Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand), the psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced that he suffers from multiple personality disorder caused by years of abuse at the hands of his father. Vail does not want to hear this, because he knows that he cannot enter an... The answer is:","output":"Stampler is found not guilty because his defense attorney, Martin Vail, successfully argues that he suffers from multiple personality disorder caused by years of abuse at the hands of his father.

Jim: lecture Jim: free in 30 min Kate: ok What were the main points in that conversation?","output":"The conversation, while brief, comprised a few main points: 1. Invitation for Coffee: The conversation begins with Kate asking Jim to grab a coffee with her, indicating that she is willing and eager to spend some time with Jim in a casual, chilled-out setting such as a coffee house. This proposal shows her desire for shared, relaxed social activity. To delve further, this could either be an impromptu casual plan or part of a regular meet-up ritual they follow.  2. Jim's Current Engagement: Jim's reply, \\"lecture\\", indicates that he currently is engaged in an activity and is unable to accept Kate's invitation at the present moment. The term suggests that he is likely in an educational setup or perhaps at a conference where he is listening to a lecture. This could also suggest a professional obligation to attend the said lecture, or simply a commitment to personal growth and learning.  3. Availability: Jim then indicates when he will be free to meet with Kate, which is \\"in 30 min\\". This shows his willingness to meet Kate despite the ongoing commitment. By proactively sharing his availability, he is demonstrating interest in complying with Kate's initial proposal once his current engagement ends, thus giving a practical timeframe for the plan.  4. Acknowledgment: Eventually, Kate confirms her acceptance of the updated timeframe to meet for coffee with an \\"ok\\". This signifies that she is fine with the delay and is ready to work with the revised plan. Her ability to adapt to the change in schedule indicates flexibility in her approach towards the gathering, highlighting the casual undertone of the meet-up which doesn't need to strictly adhere to the initially proposed time.  In summarizing, the conversation features a proposed casual coffee meet-up, a barrier in immediate execution of the plan due to an ongoing lecture engagement, declared availability soon after the lecture concludes, and the acknowledgment of the updated meeting schedule."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It based on a modified version of the id Tech 2 engine.  - Colonia Copia Claudia Augusta Lugdunum (modern: Lyon, France) was an important Roman city in Gaul. The city was founded in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus. It served as the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis and was an important city in the western half of the Roman Empire for centuries. Two emperors, Claudius and Caracalla, were born in Lugdunum. In the time period 69192 AD the city population could be as large as 50,000 to 100,000. Even figures of up to 200,000 people are proposed by Albert Grenier.  - Claudius (1 August 10 BC  13 October 54 AD) was Roman emperor from 41 to 54. A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was the son of Drusus and Antonia Minor. He was born at Lugdunum in Gaul, the first Roman Emperor to be born outside Italy. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his consulship, shared with his nephew Caligula in 37.  - Plautia Urgulanilla ( fl . 1st century ) was the first wife of the future Roman Emperor Claudius . They married sometime around the year 9 CE , when Claudius was 18 years old . According to Suetonius , Claudius divorced her in 24 on grounds of adultery by Plautia and his suspicions of her involvement in the murder of her sister - in - law Apronia .  - Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, commonly known as Suetonius (c. 69  after 122 AD), was a Roman historian belonging to the equestrian order who wrote during the early Imperial era of the Roman Empire.  - The term Julio-Claudian dynasty refers to the first five Roman emperorsAugustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Neroor the family to which they belonged. They ruled the Roman Empire from its formation under Augustus in the second half of the 1st century (44/31/27) BC, until AD 68 when the last of the line, Nero, committed suicide.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Caligula, properly Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (31 August AD 12  24 January AD 41) was Roman emperor from AD 3741. Born Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus (not to be confused with Julius Caesar), Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Caligula's biological father was Germanicus, and he was the great-nephew and adopted son of Emperor Tiberius. The young Gaius earned the nickname \\"Caligula\\" (meaning \\"little soldier's boot\\", the diminutive form of \\"caliga\\", hob-nailed military boot) from his father's soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in Germania.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - The Pontifex Maximus (Latin, literally: \\"greatest pontiff\\" or \\"greatest bridge-builder\\") was the high priest of the College of Pontiffs (\\"Collegium Pontificum\\") in ancient Rome. This was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian (reigned 375383) who, however, then decided to omit the words \\"pontifex maximus\\" from his title. Although the most influential office within Roman priesthood, the \\"pontifex maximus\\" was ranked the fifth in the ranking of the highest Roman priests (\\"ordo sacerdotum\\"), behind the \\"rex sacrorum\\" and the \\"flamines maiores\\" (\\"Flamen Dialis\\", \\"Flamen Martialis\\", \\"Flamen Quirinalis\\").  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.  - Adultery (anglicised from Latin \\"adulterium\\") is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Though what sexual activities constitute adultery varies, as well as the social, religious and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.

What happens is a scientist tries to bring himself back to life but it doesn't work, but a detective, who is kind of like Will Smith, thinks he DID sruvive and is planning to spread these little nanorobots all over Los Angeles and San Diego. The dialogue is excellent, maybe the best i've EVER read in a book. The characters are all pretty cliche, though. But what's best about it is that it remains \\"scientificky\\" without like th 100-page lectures that other hard science writers put in their novels. It skips all that boring stuff. The writing style is good, and fast-paced. Saltzman doesn't waste five pages describving a room, he gets on with the story very quickly, which kind of explains why ALOT of things happen in an nly 250-page novel or so. Anyway, I'd give it about 4 and a half stars, I wouldn't give it 5 because there is a HUUUUGGGEEEE twist at the end that I honestly don't like very much. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"No, this product review is not negative. Despite highlighting a few areas for improvement, such as the clichéd characters and the unwelcome plot twist towards the end, the reviewer also mentions quite a few positive aspects of the book. They praise the exceptional dialogue, good and fast-paced writing style, and the way the author manages to maintain scientific authenticity without falling into excessively long and boring explanations. Additionally, the reviewer appreciates the concise, action-packed narrative within a relatively short page count.  The book is recognized as a blend of science fiction, mystery, and thriller genres, which could be the perfect combination for readers who enjoy all three. Although the reviewer does not agree entirely with the final plot twist, this is usually a subjective matter and may be appreciated by other readers. Moreover, the unsatisfied plot twist was not sufficient to result in a low rating; the reviewer still rates the book at 4 and half stars out of 5.  While there are a few criticisms, they do not dominate the review and seem to be outweighed by the reviewer’s praise. In total, it’s a quite balanced review, perhaps leaning more towards the positive side.

Sanders and Clinton Compete for Young Latino Votes Angel Fernandez, an undocumented 20-year-old born in Mexico, did not drive five hours from Phoenix to Las Vegas to campaign for Bernie Sanders just because the two share an opinion about immigration reform. Fernandez, whose undocumented mother once worked as a landscaper in Phoenix’s intense summer heat and was nearly deported, could have been the textbook single-issue immigration voter. But walking through Sin City’s outskirts on a windy Thursday afternoon, Fernandez balked at the idea of being just an immigration activist. He said he is supporting Sanders more for, well, everything. This election, Fernandez said, is a referendum on the status quo—not just the immigration system. “Whether it be climate change, immigration, black lives or gun control, all of this is intertwined,” Fernandez said, canvassing clipboard in hand. “There are some very powerful people in this country and they’re pulling the strings on all of it. Once you get to the root of the problem, all of these roots will fall.” Fernandez is one of many young Americans who are rejecting identity politics in favor a wider lens. Criminal injustice, corruption, unequal pay for women and even climate change are faces on the same die, politically conscious millennials say. It is impossible to view issues as separate, they say—and in doing so, they are upsetting the usual logic of campaigns. It is a rebuke to the traditional mode of winning elections, in which candidates tailor their message to isolated groups, with promises given like obligatory favors: immigration reform for Latinos, equal pay for women, criminal justice reform for African Americans, legal protections for members of the LGBT community. As Sanders and Hillary Clinton spent a final day on Friday fighting for Nevada’s large Latino population in advance of Saturday’s caucus, that shifting ground was apparent as young voters in the audiences demanded much more than an answer on immigration. “Our parents’ generation thought about immigration like, ‘once this gets fixed, something else gets fixed,'” said Sandra Gamez, a 24-year-old Clinton supporter and DREAMer. “Our generation understands that all these different issues are intersecting and come as part of an intersectional identity.” A canvasser for Sanders, Maria Castro, said she is a “multifaceted” voter.“I am a U.S. citizen that has an undocumented mother. That also cares about student debt, that cares about climate change, that cares about living wages, that cares about black lives. I care about all these issues,” said Castro, 22, on Thursday outside a Sanders campaign office in Las Vegas that shares a building with a Spanish-speaking tax accountant. “I’m not just a one-issue person.” Nevada, the first contest where a significant portion of voters are Latino, is a curtain-raiser that will presage how successfully Clinton and Sanders appeal to Latino voters in the race to come. Latinos were 15% of caucusgoers in the state in 2008, and the numbers are likely to be higher this year. And Latinos will be an increasingly crucial part of the electorate in 2016 for Democrats. They voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2012 and the Republican Party has done little to win their support in this election cycle. Donald Trump’s rhetoric about deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants and building a “beautiful wall” at the Mexican border has pulled the entire field of Republican candidates to the right and alienated many. Sanders, who has been criticized as sputtering and tone-deaf on race issues, may be surprisingly well-positioned to capture young Latinos looking for a bigger message. When he speaks to a Latino audience, the Vermont senator mostly delivers the same rote lines about bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows but then returns to his usual themes: political corruption, corporate influence, income inequality and social injustice. “All of these things that young people are experiencing, that the Latino community is disproportionately experiencing, it’s all under this umbrella that [the system] is broken and not working for the everyday person,” said Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state legislator who is running for Congress and has backed Sanders. “Sen. Sanders manages to bring all of that together for people.” Clinton has hewed closer to the familiar political playbook. She began in the first month of her campaign with a roundtable of DREAMers in early May, promising comprehensive immigration reform. She has drafted Latino surrogates to criticize Sanders and pick through his record. She wields a rudimentary Spanish when it is useful. “You know, I was the first person to call out Donald Trump,” Clinton said at the MSNBC/Telemundo town hall also on Thursday in Las Vegas. “’Basta, enough!’ I said, ‘Basta!’ enough of this prejudice and paranoia and the kind of language that he uses.” Clinton repeatedly attacks Sanders for his opposition to the 2007 immigration reform legislation introduced by Sen. Ted Kennedy, a precursor to the failed effort in 2013 and one that had extensive, though lukewarm, Latino support. Her criticism—as well as opposition from Rep. Xavier Becerra of California and Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, two Clinton supporters—has put Sanders on the defensive. Clinton’s super PAC points out that Sanders said in a 2007 television interview that he opposed the immigration bill because the extensive guest worker program would drive down wages for Americans. But he now justifies his vote by pointing to the guest worker program’s potential abuse of migrant workers, which the Southern Poverty Law Center called “akin to slavery.” “I voted against the legislation in 2007 in agreement with groups like LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations, in agreement with the AFL-CIO, for a number of reasons,” Sanders said in the town hall on Thursday in Las Vegas. Sanders, though, can seem wooden when addressing Latinos concerned about immigration reform. When a woman asked Sanders at the Thursday town hall when he would take action to end rules barring undocumented immigrants from returning to the U.S. for 10 years, he seemed to hedge. “That I can’t tell you,” he said. When pressed by a moderator, Sanders said touchily, “I’m not a dictator here. It has to do with a little bit of cooperation from the Congress.” And Clinton’s efforts to court Latinos have at times backfired, as when her campaign in December published a post called “7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela,” prompting the hashtag #NotMyAbuela. But young Latino supporters of both candidates have reasons for their loyalty. When asked what their top reasons were for supporting Sanders, a group of canvassers all gave different answers, from corruption to climate change and student debt. “What’s popular in our generation is striking a chord with everyone, rather than compartmentalizing,” said Fernandez, the undocumented DREAMer from Phoenix. “It all leads back to the same thing if you follow the money.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The article discusses the competition between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton for the votes of young Latino voters in the US. It highlights the fact that the young Latino voter population is rejecting identity politics and looking for candidates that they believe are addressing a multitude of interconnected issues. This includes climate change, immigration, inequality, educational opportunities and social injustice amongst others, rather than focusing on a single issue for one constituent group.  These young Latino voters are generally in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, but it is not their sole focus when choosing a candidate. Both Sanders and Clinton have campaigned on immigration reform, but their approaches differ somewhat, with Sanders focusing more on broader themes like income inequality and social injustice. Clinton, on the other hand, has focused more on specific policies and direct appeals to the Latino community. As the article states, \\"As Sanders and Hillary Clinton spent a final day on Friday fighting for Nevada’s large Latino population in advance of Saturday’s caucus, that shifting ground was apparent as young voters in the audiences demanded much more than an answer on immigration.\\" The Latino vote is becoming increasingly important for both the Democratic and Republican Parties in the US, as their share of the electorate continues to grow. This article suggests that Sanders and Clinton's competition for the young Latino votes serves as a preview of how each candidate hopes to appeal to this demographic throughout the 2016 election cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Eisenhower's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat, as military priorities diminished; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs. He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing, and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower, then a journalist at the Agriculture Department, he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe. He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928. After a one-year assignment in France, Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to February 1933. Major Dwight D.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation -4*q = 18 + 43 - 33 for q, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation The first step is to simplify the equation by combining the constants on the right side of the equation.  -4*q = 18 + 43 - 33 To do this, we will add 18 to 43 and subtract 33: 18 + 43 = 61 61 - 33 = 28 Now, we can rewrite the equation with the simplified constant: -4*q = 28 Step 2: Solve for q Now that the equation is simplified, we need to solve for q. To do this, we want to isolate the variable q on one side of the equation.  Since -4 is currently multiplied by q, we need to perform the inverse operation, which is division, to eliminate the factor of -4.  We will divide both sides of the equation by -4: (-4*q) / (-4) = 28 / (-4) This will simplify to: q = -7 So, the solution to the equation -4*q = 18 + 43 - 33 is q = -7."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body - The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth.  Question: suppose a person is having difficulties breathing happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"When a person experiences difficulties in breathing, it can have a significant impact on the amount of oxygen being brought into the body as well as on the process of carbon dioxide removal. To better understand the situation, let us first examine the normal breathing process and then discuss the effect of the perturbation on the different steps. In the normal breathing process, air containing oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is drawn into the body through the mouth and nose. This inhaled air travels down the trachea, which divides into bronchial tubes that lead to each lung. The bronchial tubes further branch into smaller tubes called bronchioles, which end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. It is within these alveoli that the exchange of gases occurs – O2 enters the bloodstream by diffusing across the alveolar and capillary walls, while CO2 leaves the bloodstream, following the reverse path, to be expelled from the body. Suppose a person is experiencing difficulties in breathing, which could arise from various factors such as respiratory infections, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other underlying conditions. This perturbation can have several effects on both the amount of oxygen being brought to the body and the removal of carbon dioxide, as explained below: 1. Reduced air intake: In cases where the airflow into the body is restricted due to airway obstruction or poor lung function, less oxygen will be drawn in during each breath, which could lead to lower O2 levels in the bloodstream, tissues, and cells. Consequently, this may impair various physiological processes, particularly those related to energy production. 2. Impaired gas exchange: The efficiency of O2 and CO2 exchange within the alveoli can be affected by factors such as inflammation, edema (fluid buildup), or damage to the alveolar walls – all of which are common consequences of breathing difficulties. These issues can further exacerbate the imbalance of O2 and CO2 levels in the body. Considering the above-discussed effects of breathing difficulties on the respiratory process, we can conclude that a perturbation in this system would result in: A. LESS oxygen being brought to the body: Due to decreased airflow and compromised gas exchange, the body will receive an insufficient amount of oxygen, which may lead to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and negatively affect various physiological processes. B. MORE carbon dioxide accumulation: As the body struggles to expel CO2, there is likely to be an increased accumulation of this waste gas, which can lead to hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels) and cause further harm, such as respiratory acidosis (a condition where blood becomes too acidic). In conclusion, difficulties in breathing can notably impact the respiratory process by making it less effective in providing the body with sufficient oxygen and efficiently removing carbon dioxide. This perturbation can have adverse implications for overall health and well-being, making it crucial to identify and address the underlying causes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear LDL particles from their blood. Although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site.

Joy Division were an English post-punk band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer-songwriter Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The band was formed by Sumner and Hook after attending a 4 June 1976 Sex Pistols concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. While Joy Division's early recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they evolved a unique sound, aided by producer Martin Hannett, which earned their reputation as pioneers of the post-punk movement. On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Sumner and Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were was inspired by the Pistol's performance. The following day Hook borrowed PS35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. Sumner said that he felt that they \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in\\".  Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they sped off.  In August 1977, the band placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \\"fitted perfectly\\" with the other men, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \\"complete 'family'\\". To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing their new name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel House of Dolls. In December, the group recorded what became their debut EP, An Ideal for Living, at Pennine Sound Studio and played their final gig as Warsaw on New Year's Eve at The Swinging Apple in Liverpool.

Mitä presidentti Mbeki ja muut Afrikan maiden johtajat itse asiassa pelkäävät on se, että väkivalta ja antikolonialistinen kapina voisi levitä myös naapurimaihin. Translate this to English?","output":"What President Mbeki and other African leaders actually fear is that violence and anti-colonial rebellion could also spread to neighboring countries. This sentence refers to a speculated concern of Thabo Mbeki, a former President of South Africa, as well as other African leaders that violent actions and rebellions against colonial forces could potentially extend beyond the borders of their own countries and affect the stability of neighboring nations.  This fear is grounded in the complex and often difficult political history of Africa, which has seen numerous violent uprisings and anti-colonial movements in the past. The impact of such uprisings and movements have often been severe, resulting in political instability, human rights violations, destruction of infrastructure, economic challenges, and loss of life. The leaders' concern here lies not only in the immediate impact of potential violence and rebellion, but also in its long-standing implications. The spread of such actions can undermine the political and socioeconomic development efforts within these countries, hamper regional cooperation efforts, and strain relationships with global partners.  In addition, the potential spread of violence can have heavy implications for national security. For countries with a history of internal conflict, the prospect of containing potential violence within borders is already a daunting task, and the spreading of such conflicts to neighboring countries, potentially triggering reciprocal actions or sparking larger regional conflicts, can escalate the situation even further. Ultimately, the fear that President Mbeki and other African leaders have, as hinted in the sentence, reflects their understanding of the intricate political landscape of Africa and the delicate balance required to maintain stability and drive progressive change in their respective countries and the region as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Erin went to Jennifer to stylize a wig, but no one was there.","output":"Erin was really excited to get her wig stylized by her friend Jennifer. So, one sunny day, she grabbed her favorite wig, put it in a pretty bag, and skipped over to Jennifer's house. When Erin reached Jennifer's house, it was painted in all colours of the rainbow, just like the wigs that Jennifer used to make. Erin knocked on the door and waited patiently, but nobody opened it. So she thought maybe Jennifer was in the backyard, playing with her dog, Mr. Woofles. Erin walked around the house, clutching her wig tightly, and called out, \\"Jennifer? Mr. Woofles?\\" There was no answer. It seemed like Jennifer and Mr. Woofles were not at home. Erin felt sad and disappointed because she really wanted her wig to look amazing, just like a magical unicorn's mane.  Now, Erin had two choices. She could either go back home and try again later or leave the wig at Jennifer's doorstep with a little note, telling Jennifer how she wanted the wig to look. Erin decided to do the second option, because she knew that Jennifer would understand her amazing unicorn wig idea. So, Erin carefully placed the wig on Jennifer's doorstep, and using her sparkly pen, she wrote on a piece of paper, \\"Dear Jennifer, I want my wig to be just like a magical unicorn's mane. Please make it extra colorful and sparkly. Love, Erin.\\" She left the note on top of the wig and went back home. A few days later, Erin received a surprise when Jennifer came to her front door with the most beautiful, colorful, and sparkly wig Erin had ever seen! Erin was so happy that she hugged Jennifer tightly and wore her new magical unicorn wig all day long. Erin and Jennifer then spent the whole day playing with wigs and wearing them like princesses, unicorns, and even superheroes.

Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Florence de LaSalle Cafiero, a homemaker, and Angelo Lafayette Paterno, a law clerk. His family was of Italian ancestry. He spoke throughout his life with a marked Brooklyn accent. In 1944, Paterno graduated from Brooklyn Preparatory School. Paterno was a long-time advocate for some type of college football playoff system. The question was posed to him frequently over the years, as only one of his five undefeated teams was voted national champion.  Paterno believed that scholarship college athletes should receive a modest stipend, so that they have some spending money. As justification, Paterno pointed out that many scholarship athletes came from poor families and that other students had time to hold down a part-time job, whereas busy practice and conditioning schedules prevented college athletes from working during the school year.  Paterno initially preferred not to play true freshmen, but later in his career he did play redshirts in order to refrain from being at a competitive disadvantage. Some Penn State recruits, like recruits at many other schools, now graduate from high school a semester early so that they can enroll in college during the spring semester and participate in spring practice. Several team members from the recruiting class of 2005, including Justin King, Anthony Scirrotto, and Derrick Williams, received considerable playing time as true freshmen during the 2005-2006 season.  In 2010, Paterno and former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka suggested that concussions and other injuries in the NFL and college football might be reduced if face masks were eliminated.  Penn State's football players were twice recognized for outstanding academic performance by the New America Foundation's Academic Bowl Championship Series while under the leadership of Paterno. The team was ranked number one out of the top 25 ranked BCS teams in 2009 and 2011. The criteria in the rankings include the graduation rate of the team as compared to the rest of university, the difference between the graduation rate of African-American players and the rest of the squad as well as the same statistics for the rest of the students at Penn State, and the graduation rate differences between the African American players and students.

Write a title for this article: An 18-year-old student at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring faces charges of selling marijuana after two students suffered elevated heart rates after eating one of his pot-laced brownies, according to arrest records filed in Montgomery County. The student, William Conrad Keysar, allegedly sold two 15 brownies at the school in late November, officials said Friday. One of the brownies was consumed by as many as three girls at the school. Two of them, according to the arrest records, then went to the school’s health room. “Both girls were found to be suffering from an elevated heart rate and appeared confused,” the arrest records say. They were taken by ambulance to Holy Cross Hospital. The girls were treated and released, Officer Rick Goodale, a police spokesman, said. School officials said they were fully aware of the situation. “This matter was immediately referred to police who investigated and charged the student,” said Derek Turner, a spokesman for the county school system. “We’ve also addressed it as a disciplinary matter with the students involved.” Keysar faces two counts of marijuana distribution and two counts of marijuana distribution on school property, according to court records. But he is hardly a major drug dealer, said his attorney, David Moyse. “He’s not even a minor drug dealer,” Moyse said. “William and his family are focused on his future.” Moyse called his client “a fine young man.” He declined to discuss details of the case, saying he wanted to meet with prosecutors before doing so. Charging documents, which outline the police account of the case, spelled out somewhat informal sales transactions — one of which was allegedly captured on school security video. The police case is based, in part, on what Keysar said after being confronted about the ill students, acknowledging that he “gave two girls weed brownies,” according to the charging documents. One of the students who got sick told another girl that she paid 15 for a brownie and shared it with two others. This student bought a second brownie for another student from Keysar, according to the documents, and then gave it to the other student. Dan Morse covers courts and crime in Montgomery County.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"When considering the linguistic integrity of a sentence, we examine several aspects including syntax (structure and order of words), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (context). Let's analyze the sentence using these parameters: 1. Syntax - \\"Harry thinks that Sally is innocent, although no one else thinks so.\\" This sentence is syntactically correct. It's composed of a main clause, \\"Harry thinks that Sally is innocent,\\" and a subordinate clause, \\"although no one else thinks so.\\" The order of words is logical and adheres to common English language structure. 2. Semantics - It effectively communicates the idea that Harry believes in Sally's innocence, despite differing opinions from others. The words chosen provide clear and concise meaning. 3. Pragmatics - Without more context, it's hard to evaluate pragmatics definitively. However, the sentence does imply certain social dynamics and presents a strong, standalone idea. Thus, considering these different dimensions, we can conclude that the sentence maintains its linguistic integrity as it is syntactically sound, semantically clear, and pragmatically sufficient as a stand-alone context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In which novel does fictional private eye Philip Marlowe first appear? Answer:","output":"The first appearance of the fictional private eye Philip Marlowe occurs in the novel \\"The Big Sleep\\" by American author Raymond Chandler. The novel was first published in 1939 and is considered to be a classic in the hard-boiled detective fiction genre. Philip Marlowe is a Los Angeles-based private investigator with a strong sense of justice, honor, and personal integrity. The character became iconic for his wit, cynicism, and intelligence, and was often seen navigating the dark and morally corrupt world of criminals, femmes fatales, and corrupt officials. In \\"The Big Sleep,\\" Marlowe is hired by an ailing millionaire, General Sternwood, to investigate a case of blackmail involving his promiscuous younger daughter, Carmen. The blackmailer turns out to be a small-time bookseller named Arthur Geiger, who is running an illegal pornography business. As Marlowe digs deeper into the case, the body count rises and Marlowe is drawn into a complex web of deceit, murder, and organized crime. The novel is a vivid portrayal of the seedy side of Los Angeles during the 1930s and is rich in atmosphere and grounded in the gritty realities of the city. Throughout the course of the story, Marlowe maintains a strong moral compass amid the treachery and morally ambiguous characters. Chandler's writing style, peppered with sharp one-liners and blending noir elements with the hard-boiled detective tradition, helped elevate \\"The Big Sleep\\" to both critical and popular acclaim. The success of \\"The Big Sleep\\" led to a series of novels featuring Philip Marlowe, including \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\" (1940), \\"The High Window\\" (1942), \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" (1943), \\"The Little Sister\\" (1949), \\"The Long Goodbye\\" (1953), and \\"Playback\\" (1958). The character of Marlowe has also been adapted into numerous films, radio dramas, television shows, and stage plays, further solidifying the character's legacy as a cornerstone of American detective fiction and popular culture. In conclusion, \\"The Big Sleep\\" is the first novel featuring the iconic private detective Philip Marlowe. The story revolves around Marlowe being tasked with solving a blackmail case, which eventually leads him down a treacherous path filled with corruption, murder, and intrigue. The novel and its protagonist, Philip Marlowe, served as a template for numerous detective stories and their archetypical characters, impacting the development of crime fiction and popular culture for decades to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what increases a body's strength\\" is \\"through play\\", given that  running and lifting increases a body's strength? The answer is:","output":"While \\"through play\\" may be a component of increasing a body's strength, it is not a comprehensive or detailed answer to the question. A more thorough response would be: Increasing a body's strength can be achieved through various means, including regular exercise, proper nutrition, adequate rest, and consistent practice. Engaging in strength-building exercises such as weightlifting, resistance training, and bodyweight exercises (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, squats) helps to break down muscle fibers, which are then rebuilt and strengthened during recovery. Running, a form of cardiovascular exercise, can also contribute to overall strength by improving heart health, endurance, and muscular tone, particularly in the lower body. However, running might not be the most effective way to increase strength, mainly if the focus is on building muscle mass and overall power. Nutrition also plays a significant role in increasing physical strength. Consuming a balanced diet, rich in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, is vital for providing the body with the necessary fuel and nutrients to build and repair muscles efficiently. Lastly, giving the body adequate rest and recovery time is crucial in the process of building strength. Recovery allows the muscles to repair and grow, ultimately leading to increased strength. Sleep is an essential aspect of this, as healthy sleeping habits promote optimal muscle repair and hormone regulation. \\"Through play\\" could be a valid means of increasing strength if it incorporates activities that provide the above elements, such as sports that involve running, jumping, and other movements that work the body's muscles. However, this answer does not fully address the factors involved in fostering strength development."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Persian.

Answer the following question: This article: After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was.  According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.  During this time, Cobain admitted, \\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong.  The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\"  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.  The producer declined; as he recalled, \\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'

Article:","output":"Title: Catching a Halibut: A Fun and Easy Adventure at the Sea Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about how to catch a cool fish called halibut. Imagine you are on a fun boat ride with your family, and you get to do a really great adventure at the sea. Here is what you need to do: 1. Drop your bait close to the bottom of the sea floor:  When you want to catch a halibut, you need to use something called 'bait' to make the fish interested in your fishing line. The bait can be something like a little piece of food that the fish really likes to eat. You need to put this bait on a special thing called a 'hook', and then you drop it deep into the water until it reaches near the bottom part of the sea where the ground is. This is where halibut usually like to hang out. 2. Wait for a halibut to take the bait: Now that your bait is deep in the water and close to the sea floor, you need to be very patient and wait for a halibut to see the bait and think, \\"Yummy! That looks like a tasty snack!\\" When a halibut comes along and starts to eat the bait, you will feel that your fishing line is moving or getting a little bit heavier. 3. Set your hook and steadily pull the line up with control: Once you feel that a halibut is eating your bait, we have to do a thing called 'setting the hook'. This means you have to gently pull on the fishing line so that the hook catches the fish. Remember to do this carefully and with control, we don't want to hurt the fish, but we want to make sure it doesn't get away. After setting the hook, you can start slowly lifting the fishing line up from the water. 4. Allow a \\"spooked\\" halibut to run free for a bit: Sometimes, when a halibut realizes it is being caught, it gets scared and starts to swim very fast to get away. This is called a \\"spooked\\" halibut. If this happens, it's okay! Just let the fish swim a little bit and then slowly start pulling the fishing line again. The halibut may get tired after a while and will be easier to catch. That's it! Now you know how to catch a halibut during your fun adventure at the sea. Remember, it's important to be gentle and patient when catching a fish. Halibut are amazing creatures, and by following these steps, you can experience the joy of catching one.

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

After his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. Having known no romance in quite some time, nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant Marie, at a local book store in a Rhode Island small town on the ocean, where he has gone to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After liking Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. It is clear from the outset that Dan and Marie are made for one another, and although we sense what the outcome will be, we go for the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, an author and screenplay writer on his own, has given us two excellent novels, \\"What's Eating Gilber Grapes\\", and \\"An Ocean in Iowa\\", and the delightful indie, \\"Pieces of April, which he also directed. It's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions. The best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. Mr. Carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time. In many ways, he remind us of Jack Lemmon, in his take of comedy and serious material. What can one say about Ms. Binoche, an intelligent actress, and a bright presence in any film. She proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her Marie. The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing to do. They just serve as incidental music for decoration. Dane Cook, who is seen as brother Mitch, fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others. \\"Dan in Real Life\\" is a delightful film that will please everyone.

The reviewer draws comparisons between Steve Carell and the iconic Jack Lemmon, appreciating Carell's ability to take on both comedic and dramatic roles effectively.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Jumping on your bike, even in the city, is becoming increasingly popular--- in London, for example, cycle use has more than doubled in the past ten years. So, which is the best bike for you?     If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure .     For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous.     Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300.     A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350.     For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500.     Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears   ---and tend to be heavier, too. Finally, items such as mudguards  aren't always included.","output":"Based on the given article, which type of bike is best suited for you? A. Folding bikes: Suitable for short commutes, easily transportable on trains and kept secured indoors. B. Road bikes: Designed for longer journeys, featuring drop handlebars and narrow tires for better performance on roads.  C. Mountain bikes: Ideal for off-road travel, with strong, fat tires suitable for tackling steep, muddy terrain. D.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals? ?  John Doubleday (about 1798 – 25 January 1856) was a British craftsperson, restorer, and dealer in antiquities who was employed by the British Museum for the last 20 years of his life. He undertook several duties for the museum, not least as a witness in criminal trials, but was primarily their specialist restorer, perhaps the first person to hold the position. He is best known for his 1845 restoration of the severely-damaged Roman Portland Vase, an accomplishment that places him at the forefront of his profession at the time. While at the British Museum, Doubleday also dealt in copies of coins, medals, and ancient seals. His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\".Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution? Solve 703 = 42*a + 15 - 68 for a.","output":"To solve the equation 703 = 42*a + 15 - 68 for a, first, we simplify the right side of the equation and then isolate the variable a on one side of the equation. Below is a detailed procedure: The given equation is:  703 = 42*a + 15 - 68  Start by performing the addition and subtraction operation on the right hand side.  Combine +15 and -68 to get -53, therefore, the equation becomes: 703 = 42*a - 53  Next, we'll isolate the term with 'a' (42*a) on one side of the equation.  To do this, we'll add 53 on both sides of the equation to cancel out -53 on the right. 703 + 53 = 42*a - 53 + 53  Which simplifies to: 756 = 42*a  Now, we need to get 'a' by itself.  Since 42 is multiplied by 'a' on the right hand side, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 42 to solve for 'a'.  756 / 42 = 42*a / 42  That simplifies to: a = 756 / 42  Perform the division operation to get the value of 'a'.  a = 18  Therefore, the solution to the equation 703 = 42*a + 15 - 68 for a is a = 18."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Comes as family of IRA victim Jean McConville continue fight for justice. Article:","output":"Title: Government's \\"Comfort Letters\\" to 'On the Runs' Threaten to Reignite Loyalist Anger Introduction: The revelation of so-called \\"comfort letters\\" has sparked controversy in Northern Ireland. These letters, sent from the government to individuals suspected of involvement in past criminal activities often linked to paramilitary organizations, have offered reassurance that they are no longer wanted by the authorities. The issue has emerged in the wake of the collapsed Hyde Park bombing case, threatening to reignite Loyalist anger in the region. Step 1: Explaining the \\"comfort letters\\" and their origins As a response to the growing unrest and demand for justice, the government discreetly sent out these \\"comfort letters\\" to individuals known as \\"on the runs,\\" those who have been linked to criminal activities in the past but are currently not facing any charges. The purpose of these letters was to reassure these individuals and keep the peace in Northern Ireland. Step 2: Discussing the implications of the Hyde Park bombing case The collapse of the Hyde Park bombing case has brought to light the existence of these secret guarantees. The Hyde Park bombing, a notorious IRA attack that took place in 1982, left four soldiers dead and resulted in a long and complicated legal battle. Despite the discovery of a key suspect, the case ultimately collapsed due to a lack of substantial evidence and issues related to these \\"comfort letters.\\" Step 3: Considering the potential fallout and Loyalist anger The revelation of these \\"comfort letters\\" has fueled the already charged tensions in Northern Ireland, threatening to reignite Loyalist anger. The potential for a resurgence of violence and political instability is concerning, given the region's tumultuous history with acts of terrorism and the ongoing fight for justice. Step 4: Connecting the issue to the unsolved case of Jean McConville The revelation of these \\"comfort letters\\" coincides with the ongoing fight for justice for the family of Jean McConville, an IRA victim who was abducted and murdered in 1972. Her case, still unresolved, serves as a stark reminder of the continued impact of past acts of terrorism and political violence on the families of victims. Conclusion: As the controversy surrounding the government's \\"comfort letters\\" unfolds, there is growing concern about the potential destabilization of Northern Ireland. The secrecy and implications of these reassurances to suspected criminals have angered many and threaten to reopen old wounds. The pursuit of justice for victims like Jean McConville and the families of the Hyde Park bombing remains paramount, and the ramifications of these revelations will likely fuel ongoing debates about how to address and heal from Northern Ireland's troubled past."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be given two sentences separated by \\"because\\".

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose video choreography was liberally adapted from for the video \\"Single Ladies?\\" , can you please find it?   The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" was shot immediately after that of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", but it received less attention during production than the \\"higher-gloss, higher-profile video\\" for \\"If I Were a Boy\\". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix. Beyoncé wanted to attempt a similar dance and eventually, the choreography of \\"Single Ladies\\" was liberally adapted from \\"Mexican Breakfast\\": I saw a video on YouTube. [The dancers] had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept a lot of the Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture ... It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where was Professor Kristan's mother bitten by a vampire bat? ?  The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted.  Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer.  As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information:  - The Canadian Prairies is a region in western Canada, which may correspond to several different definitions, natural or political. Notably, the Prairie provinces or simply the Prairies comprise the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as they are partially covered by prairie (grasslands). In a more restricted sense, the term may also refer only to the areas of those provinces covered by prairie; their portions of the physiographic region known as the Interior Plains. Prairie also covers portions of northeastern British Columbia, though that province is typically not included in the region in a political sense.  - Amegilla is a large genus of bees in the tribe Anthophorini. Several species have blue metallic bands on the abdomen, and are referred to as \\"blue-banded bees\\".  - The Centridini are a tribe of large apid bees, many of which possess adaptations for carrying floral oils rather than (or in addition to) pollen or nectar. The floral oils are often gathered from plants of the family Malpighiaceae, though other plants may be visited. The oil-collecting species typically have \\"combs\\" composed of closely spaced, flattened, blunt bristles on the margins of the first tarsal segments of the front and middle legs; others may have velvety \\"pads\\" to absorb the oils. They also commonly gather plant resins for use in nest cell construction. They have a tiny pterostigma in the forewing, the female scopa is very bushy, and the first flagellomere of the antenna is often longer than the scape.  - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.  - The bee genus Anthophora is one of the largest in the family Apidae, with over 450 species worldwide in 14 different subgenera. They are most abundant and diverse in the Holarctic and African biogeographic regions. All species are solitary, though many nest in large aggregations. Nearly all species make nests in the soil, either in banks or in flat ground; the larvae develop in cells with waterproof linings and do not spin cocoons. Males commonly have pale white or yellow facial markings, and/or peculiarly modified leg armature and hairs. \\"Anthophora\\" individuals can be distinguished from the very similar genus \\"Amegilla\\" by the possession of an arolium between the tarsal claws.  - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming.  - Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States.  - The Melectini are a tribe of medium - to large - sized apid bees found essentially worldwide . They are brood parasites of the related typical digger bees ( Anthophorini ) and occasionally visit flowers e.g. in prairie landscapes of the United States . As in other cuckoo bees , females can be easily distinguished from those of their hosts by the lack of scopae and other pollen - collecting adaptations , as well as lacking prepygidial fimbria and basitibial plates . Their body hair is rather short and on the abdomen lies flat against the exoskeleton . They may , therefore , be difficult at first glance to distinguish from the Nomadinae , but the details of their wing venation are characteristic : the marginal cell is shorter than the first two submarginal cells , and the second abscissa of vein M + Cu is extremely short , with the cells it connects being almost adjacent to each other . The jugal lobes are very small , less than half as long as the vannal lobes .  - Saskatchewan (or ) is a prairie and boreal province in west-central Canada, the only province without natural borders. It has an area of , nearly 10 percent of which is fresh water, composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes.  - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities.  - Apidae is the largest family within the superfamily Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - The Anthophorini are a large tribe in the subfamily Apinae of the family Apidae. Species in this tribe are often referred to as digger bees, although this common name is sometimes also applied to members of the tribe Centridini. It has over 750 species worldwide that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae; the vast majority of species are in the genera \\"Amegilla\\" and \\"Anthophora\\".  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905. The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015.  - Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia. Lands typically referred to as \\"prairie\\" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota. The Central Valley of California is also a prairie. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.  - The Apinae are the subfamily that includes the majority of bees in the family Apidae. It includes the familiar \\"corbiculate\\" (pollen basket) bees  bumblebees, honey bees, orchid bees, stingless bees, and the extinct genus \\"Euglossopteryx\\". It also includes all but two of the groups (excluding Nomadinae and Xylocopinae) that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae.  - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains.  - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - Indiana is a U.S. state located in the midwestern and Great Lakes regions of North America.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.  - Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions.

The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.

As they ride around, Archer runs his hand over Michael's face and smiles.Meanwhile, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) sets up a suppressed sniper rifle on the hill overlooking the carousel. He takes aim at Archer, waits until he gets a clean shot, and fires. The bullet hits Archer in the back, and he and his son fall off the horse, leaving a noticeable bloodstain on the horse's mane. Three balloons are seen drifting away into the sky.Moments later, Archer is shown lying on his stomach, in pain, the bullet having gone cleanly through his body as bystanders rush over to him.

Background: Ilya Nikolayevich Bryzgalov ( ( listen); Russian: Il'ia Nikolaevich Bryzgalov; born 22 June 1980) is a Russian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He was selected in the second round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, 44th overall, by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He has also played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers, Edmonton Oilers and Minnesota Wild. In 2006-07 season, Bryzgalov won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks. Context: With the re-signing of Giguere to a four-year contract in the off-season and the acquisition of Jonas Hiller from Switzerland, the Ducks attempted to trade Bryzgalov, but were unable to. General Manager Brian Burke claimed he had a deal worked out at the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, but could not finish it. As a result, on 16 November 2007, Bryzgalov was placed on waivers and claimed by the Phoenix Coyotes the following day, on 17 November. In his first game with the team that same day, Bryzgalov made 27 saves for his third career shutout in a 1-0 win over the Los Angeles Kings. Phoenix promptly signed him to a three-year contract extension and he went on to record 26 wins in 55 games for the Coyotes as they battled for a playoff spot, establishing himself as the club's starting goaltender.  Bryzgalov again recorded 26 wins for the Coyotes during the 2008-09 season, though the Coyotes did not qualify for the playoffs. But the 2009-10 season would be a different story for Bryzgalov and the Coyotes, who would qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2002 on the back of Bryzgalov's 42 victories. The fourth-seeded Coyotes would face-off against the veteran Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Quarter-Finals. The series proved to be a see-saw battle that eventually saw Detroit prevail in seven games. Bryzgalov averaged 3.43 goals against per game during the series.  Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Coyotes during the 2010-11 season, Bryzgalov's 36 wins helped them to the sixth seed in the Western Conference and a return trip to the playoffs. Once again, the Coyotes faced the Red Wings. Despite Bryzgalov's strong play throughout the regular season, he struggled in the playoff rematch with Detroit, averaging 4.36 goals against per game as the Red Wings swept the Coyotes in four straight games. Set to become an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, the Coyotes did not meet Bryzgalov's asking price for a contract extension. On 6 June 2011, Bryzgalov's negotiation rights were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for a third-round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, forward Matt Clackson, and future considerations. Bryzgalov averaged 33 victories a season the past four seasons with the Coyotes. Question: How did the team do score wise. Whats the answer?","output":"Let me explain this in a simple way. Ilya Bryzgalov is a very good ice hockey player who used to be a goalkeeper. He played for many teams, and in one season, he helped the Phoenix Coyotes team get 42 wins, which allowed them to play in the important games called playoffs. The team tried hard but lost to the Detroit Red Wings in a very close match. Even though Bryzgalov played well the next season, they lost again to the same team. So, to answer your question, the team did pretty well with Bryzgalov's help, but they could not win the most important games called playoffs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - William Holman Hunt (2 April 1827  7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works.  - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812  9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic.

The painting was extremely controversial when first exhibited, prompting many negative reviews, most notably one written by Charles Dickens. It catapulted the previously obscure Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to notoriety and was a major contributor to the debate about Realism in the arts.  - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown.  - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\".  - Thomas Carlyle (4 December 1795  5 February 1881) was a Scottish philosopher, satirical writer, essayist, historian and teacher. Considered one of the most important social commentators of his time, he presented many lectures during his lifetime with certain acclaim in the Victorian era. One of those conferences resulted in his famous work \\"On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History\\" where he explains that the key role in history lies in the actions of the \\"Great Man\\", claiming that \\"History is nothing but the biography of the Great Man\\".  - John Ruskin (8 February 1819  20 January 1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, as well as an art patron, draughtsman, watercolourist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin also penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art was later superseded by a preference for plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

Question: What is Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular? Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular. Answer:","output":"Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit, in particular, refers to the specific Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews, encompassing their range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions that have contributed to their unique sense of Jewish identity. Historically, it involved the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and observing Jewish Law within family and communal life for both men and women. Today, it also includes elements such as manners of speech, styles of humor, and patterns of association. Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit is part of the broader Jewish cultural experience, which includes supporting Jewish institutions, engaging with Jewish literature and arts, traveling to Israel, and visiting historical synagogues."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of. I know that this was a very cheesy movie, but Uma and Anna were just so cool and Steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work. Jenny Johnson(scary, that's my best friend's actual name) is not your typical average librarian looking woman, when Matt, your average male, asks her out, he's in for more than he expected, he's asked G-Girl out on a date, the super hero of the world!

The effect were corny, but you seriously move past them quickly, the story and cast made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie, it was such a step up from Prime.

One of them I will name, the other two are mysteries and will remain so. Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV. He is unlucky in life. Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IV's \`no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' Those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn. It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV. He has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player. He is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp. \`I've never been to camp before,' says Stanley. With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake. Camp Green Lake is an odd place, with an odd philosophy, \`If you take a bad boy, make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.' We learn this little pearl of wisdom from Mr. Sir (John Voight) one of the camp's \`counselors.' We get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man. He at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesn't think he is nice. The camp's guidance councilor, Mr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson) is a different matter entirely. He acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor, but he quick, quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges. The Warden has a decided capacity for meanness, but other than that she is a mystery. These three rule Camp Green Lake, a place that has no lake. It is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes, five feet deep and five feet wide. Its local fauna, seem only to be the vultures, and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards. Green Lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place. Holes works in spite of the strange setting, and the strange story, because it understands people. Specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of Camp Green Lake. The movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly. It captures the way boys can bully each other, they way they can win admiration, the way they fight with one another, and the way boys ally themselves along the age line. It is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. What is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character. He does not believe in a family curse, he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his \`no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' In fact he loves hearing the story. Stanley IV is not bitter about the past, and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather. There is at times a lot of sadness in the film, but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness. And that is refreshing. Holes is an intelligent, insightful and witty family movie. It entertains, and not in any cheap way. It is not a comedy, though it has its laughs. It dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional. As such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. I give it a 10.","output":"The sentiment of the given review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer praises the film \\"Holes\\" for its intelligent storytelling, honest portrayal of characters, and strong understanding of human behavior.

The reviewer also commends the film's realistic portrayal of boys' interactions with each other, which serves as a crucial element for making the story believable. They find the main character's good nature and refusal to let the past's bitterness affect him refreshing compared to other movies in the family genre. Additionally, the reviewer describes \\"Holes\\" as an insightful and witty family movie that not only entertains but also provides compelling content without resorting to cheap methods. They credit the film for daring to stray from safe and conventional storytelling, allowing it to transcend being just a family movie and ultimately appeal to a wider audience. Based on their favorable feedback on various aspects of the film, the reviewer awards it a perfect score of 10."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Montana to Alice (nee Brazier, 1873-1967) and Charles Henry Cooper (1865-1946). His father had emigrated from Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) a Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother had emigrated from Gillingham, Kent and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the 600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles (eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River. For me the really satisfying things I do are offered me, free, for nothing. Ever go out in the fall and do a little hunting? See the frost on the grass and the leaves turning? Spend a day in the hills alone, or with good companions? Watch a sunset and a moonrise? Notice a bird in the wind? A stream in the woods, a storm at sea, cross the country by train, and catch a glimpse of something beautiful in the desert, or the farmlands? Free to everybody ...  Cooper's twenty-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940. The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper's image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls. The two shared a passion for the outdoors, and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun Valley. Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling--Cooper kept a copy of the poem \\"If--\\" in his dressing room--and retained as adults Kipling's sense of boyish adventure. As well as admiring Cooper's hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona, once telling a friend, \\"If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it. He's just too good to be true.\\" They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through the years.  Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving. He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg.  Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, and loved the solitude of outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional \\"yup\\" and \\"shucks\\". He once said, \\"If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet.\\" According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status--never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, \\"Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him.\\"","output":"This text is about Gary Cooper, a famous American actor who was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Montana.

By preying on smaller mammals, birds, and fish, they help keep the number of these animals in check, preventing overpopulation and ensuring the overall health and stability of their environment. Crocodilian feeding habits can vary depending on several factors, such as their species, age, size, and the availability of prey. Although they are all carnivorous, some may exhibit a preference for specific types of prey. For example, gharials, which have a narrow snout, primarily feed on fish, while the larger saltwater crocodile is known to prey on larger mammals such as deer and even buffalo. These reptiles have a unique method of hunting, which involves stealth, patience, and incredible speed. They often lie in wait on the edges of water bodies, partially submerged, waiting for an unsuspecting prey item to come within striking distance. Once their target is within reach, crocodilians use their powerful jaws to snatch the prey and drag it underwater to be eaten or drowned. Crocodilians have evolved a variety of adaptations that make them excellent hunters and efficient predators. Some of these adaptations include: 1. Powerful Jaws: Crocodilians have incredibly strong jaw muscles, enabling them to grip and hold onto their prey with ease. Their bite force is among the strongest measured in any living animal, ensuring their prey is unable to escape once caught. 2. Sharp Teeth: They possess numerous sharp, cone-shaped teeth well suited to grabbing and holding onto prey. Crocodilian teeth are designed more for holding rather than tearing, as they can swallow small prey whole and tear larger prey into manageable pieces. 3. Camouflage: Their coloration and markings provide them with excellent camouflage in their aquatic environments, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings and remain inconspicuous while they wait for prey. 4. Ambush Hunting: Crocodilians are skilled ambush hunters, remaining motionless and hidden from sight until their prey is within range. They will strike with incredible speed, catching their prey off guard. 5. Strong Swimmers: Crocodilians are streamlined and powerful swimmers, which enables them to chase down aquatic prey or swiftly close the distance to terrestrial prey at the water's edge. 6. Nostrils and Eyes on Top: One remarkable feature of crocodilians is the positioning of their nostrils and eyes on the top of their heads. This allows them to submerge most of their body underwater while still being able to breathe and see, increasing their stealth and ability to ambush prey. In summary, crocodilians are carnivorous apex predators that play a crucial role in their respective ecosystems. Consuming a diet of live animals, which includes birds, small mammals, and fish, they are adept at controlling prey populations and maintaining ecological balance. Their evolutionary adaptations make them highly effective hunters and formidable predators in their environments."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Possible A: dictionary, books, australia, seaside, countryside  Why is \\"countryside\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"Countryside is an answer aligned with human common sense because of the following reasons: 1. Context: The question states that Lance spotted a beaver in a river. This suggests Lance is in a location where beavers and rivers are present. 2. Analysis: Let's analyze the options provided -     a. Dictionary and Books: These are not physical locations where one can spot a living creature. They could only refer to metaphorical or literary appearances, which does not align with common sense in this scenario.     b. Australia: While Australia has rivers, beavers are not native to the continent. However, there's a possibility of spotting a beaver if it had been introduced to the area, but it is less likely and not a common scenario.     c. Seaside: Beavers are freshwater animals, typically found in rivers and wetlands rather than in coastal or marine environments. While it's not impossible to find a beaver near a seaside, it's less likely than in areas with freshwater habitats.     d. Countryside: Countryside areas are often characterized by large expanses of undeveloped land with forests, rivers, and wetlands, which are ideal habitats for beavers. 3. Conclusion: Based on the context of the question and analysis of the given options, \\"countryside\\" is the answer that aligns best with human common sense, because beavers are more commonly found in rivers and wetlands in rural areas, making it a more believable and likely location to spot a wet beaver in the river."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A) don't know him B) don't look at him C) don't ask him to sit at the table D) are good with him Answer:","output":"D) are good with him Explanation: The story of Mr. Clark attending a dinner party illustrates the way people are often treated based on their appearance. When Mr. Clark first arrives at the party in his old clothes, the people there don't pay any attention to him, nor do they invite him to sit down and join the meal. This treatment demonstrates that they perceive Mr. Clark as someone of low status or importance due to his shabby clothing. After returning home to change into his good clothes, Mr. Clark comes back to the party, only to be met with an entirely different reception. Now the people in the room stand up and smile at him, offering him a seat and serving him very good food. This change in their behavior toward Mr. Clark confirms that the guests at the party are treating him differently based on his outward appearance. In an effort to expose the superficiality of the guests' actions, Mr. Clark decides to make a statement by putting his good clothes into the food and telling them to eat. He does this to demonstrate that the guests' kindness and hospitality are not directed toward him as a person, but rather to his clothing and the status they represent. When Mr. Clark poses the question \\"What are you doing?\\" to the guests, he answers by asserting that he is asking his coat to eat the food because it is clear that their hospitality is meant for his clothes, not for him. This highlights the fact that the guests judge and treat people based on their appearance, rather than their character or their inherent value. Therefore, when Mr. Clark comes to the party in good clothes, the correct answer is D) the people are good with him. This scenario reveals the unfortunate truth about how some people's kindness and respect can be superficial and based solely on outward appearances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

Write some highlights for the following article: Governor of New Jersey? Who'd want THAT job? It's a state where politics have long been considered a bloodsport, where corrupt politicians are as common as slices of pizza, where fights can quickly get personal, and where the top politician lives a life constantly on the edge. It's a state whose politics have been awash in scandals for decades, particularly within its towns and communities. In the past 20 years, the state's biggest cultural exports have been a show about organized crime and \\"Jersey Shore\\" -- a show, as most New Jersey residents will be quick to tell you starred mostly New Yorkers. But, in spite of this, New Jerseyans take great pride in their state and have taken great pride in their governor. Before taking the state's highest office, Chris Christie toppled corrupt New Jersey mayors like they were dominoes, sending them to jail one after another. It was one of the most impressive demonstrations of good government in the state's history. Borger: Is Chris Christie presidential? As governor, he was lauded for his leadership and his outspokenness, and he was criticized by some in his own party for his praise of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy. But what never wavered was Christie's commitment to taking on the big issues. So for many New Jerseyans, it's disappointing to see Christie now focused on answering for the actions of staff. What they did was wrong, but if you stop and look more closely, those attacking him most harshly clearly have their own agendas. Take Democratic Sen. Loretta Weinberg. She'd love to make Christie's downfall her legacy. Prior to this current drama, Weinberg is best known for being a victim of the Bernie Madoff scam, and then for drawing on a pension system to supplement her legislative salary. She and Christie have been battling for years, and she's seeing an opportunity for payback. Meanwhile, Democratic Assemblyman Jon Wisniewski, another Christie foe, is dying for a better position in leadership, even though he's deputy speaker, a powerful chairman and the new head of an investigative committee. He's certainly got an eye on the front office himself. And Congressman Frank Pallone? He's only spent decades trying to run for statewide office. He'd love to take down Christie and ignore the fact that tourism ads are regular practice in New Jersey or any other state with an abundant coastline. The congressman certainly never complained about tourism ads during the 25 years he's represented a district that benefited from those very tourist dollars. Ad firm head: We were asked about using Christie in ad campaign. It's not just New Jersey Democrats who are playing politics with the outspoken governor and possible candidate for president in 2016. Democrats on the national level are sending fundraising letters and raising money on the backs of the popular governor. They'll do whatever it takes to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. But the most disappointing attacks are coming from the right wing of the Republican Party. After two crushing presidential elections and a paralyzed Congress, our party is badly in need of leadership. With a strong, outspoken candidate, Republicans could be right back on top. Demonstrated leadership is what will be needed in the big domestic fights that are right over the horizon, as well as those brewing overseas. Just don't let the candidate be from New Jersey. They say that if everyone hates you, you must be doing something right. Can Christie change the subject? Last week Christie held an exhausting two-hour press conference to answer questions about Fort Lee. It could not have been easy to distance himself from his two-time campaign manager -- the man who would have run Christie's presidential campaign should he choose to run. Try to remember the last time you saw a politician separate himself from someone that powerful in the organization. I'm hard pressed to find one. This week in his speech, Christie again addressed the issue. But what he did next took great leadership. He proposed longer school days. He proposed changes to the state tax code. He took on the pension system. Christie still isn't afraid to do big things. The guy is gearing up for the next big fight. The fight for New Jersey. For now, anyway. The long shadow of politics, both Democrat and Republican will keep hovering -- as will the national media -- waiting for his next move, eyeing his fundraising trips, watching for early signs of 2016 interest. None of which is going to deter the governor from doing what is necessary. There's something to be said for a politician who makes tough decisions. What also should be said is, governor, thanks for taking the job. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Camooso Miller.","output":"The article highlights the challenges faced by the Governor of New Jersey due to the complex and intense political landscape. The state has a history of political scandals, corruption, and personal battles, making it a difficult job for any politician. New Jerseyans are proud of their state and want good governance, but are often disappointed by their Governor getting caught up in controversies.  Chris Christie, the former governor, was known for his leadership and outspokenness, but also faced criticism for supporting President Obama post-Hurricane Sandy. Despite this, he continued to tackle key issues in the state. Some of Christie's opponents, both Democrats and Republicans, seem to have personal agendas and political aspirations, adding to the complexity of the state's politics.  Despite this, Gov. Christie held a two-hour press conference to address concerns about Fort Lee and proposed important changes to the state tax code, pension system, and school days. It is clear that Christie is prepared to fight for the future of New Jersey, even in an environment filled with political opponents waiting for his next move. The article concludes by appreciating Gov. Christie for making tough decisions and taking on the challenging job of leading New Jersey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Roma couple buried their ten-week-old daughter in a Paris suburb miles from their home today, after the mayor of the town where they live refused to allow her to be buried there. About 200 family members and townspeople attended a funeral Mass in Champlan, a Paris commuter town, on Monday. A hearse then took the small coffin to the town of Wissous for burial. Wissous offered a gravesite for the baby after Champlan mayor Christian Leclerc reportedly refused a burial, saying the local cemetery had 'too few plots' and 'priority is given to those who pay taxes'. Scroll down for video. Tragic: Iliana and Marin Francesca, both kneeling, grieve over the coffin of their ten-week-old daughter as she is laid to rest in a cemetery in Wissous, France, after she was refused a place in a cemetery in their town. Pain: The grieving parents and their relatives sob as they prepare to bury the baby girl. Insult heaped on loss: Wissous offered a gravesite for the baby after Christian Leclerc, the mayor of Champlan, where the family live, reportedly refused a burial, saying the local cemetery had 'too few plots' Under heavy criticism, Mayor Leclerc later denied ever refusing a burial site. A top government official said he would investigate. Whatever the truth, the case has brought to light the racism faced by France's estimated 20,000 Roma, also known as gipsies. Like Maria's parents, most live in makeshift camps with few basic amenities. The community in general is regularly linked to crime and anti-social behaviour. Pictures showed Iliana and Marin Francesca sobbing over their daughter Maria's white coffin on an damp and overcast morning in Wissous cemetery. Most of the mourners appeared to be from the Roma community, but others looked like wellwishers who had lent their support out of outrage over the way the tragic case has been handled. Loic Gandais, a Roma rights campaigner, said Mr Leclerc was simply expressing a hatred of Roma which is now widespread across France. 'It's about racism, xenophobia, and stigmatisation,' said Mr Gandais, saying the baby died in hospital in Corbeil-Essonnes from sudden infant death syndrome on Boxing Day. Sadness: Iliana and Marin Francesca walk behind their daughter's hearse as it approaches the grave plot. Difficult: Mrs Francesca stumbles in her grief as she and other mourners follow the slowly moving hearse. Why? The couple raise their faces to the sky as they grieve for their daughter, who was just ten weeks old. 'The pain of the mother must not be worsened': Right-wing UMP party mayor of Wissous, Richard Trinquier, in front of the town's city hall. He offered a plot for the child's burial, saying it was a 'question of humanity' Mr and Mrs Francesca are Romanians who have been living in France for eight years, sending their two other young children to local schools. The plot in Wissous was made available for their late daughter after Richard Trinquier, the local mayor, said it was a 'question of humanity'. 'The pain of a mother who carried a child for nine months, and lost her after two and a half months must not be worsened,' said Mr Tranquier as he announced his decision. Champlan's Roma gipsies live on two plots without fresh water or electricity. There are frequent calls for their camp to be razed. Mr Valls, France's Socialist Prime Minister, is among many who have expressed a desire to see the country rid of its Roma community. As Interior Minister, he often approved orders aimed at smashing up Roma camps and evicting entire families. He said on one occasion: 'The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. 'We are not here to welcome these people…It's not France's job to deal with the misery of the whole world.' But he struck a conciliatory note after the scandal surrounding Maria Francesca's burial, writing on Twitter: 'Refusing a child a burial because of its roots is an insult to its memory, an insult to France.'

At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain.  Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction.

Movie title: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning Movie plot: On August 7, 1939, a young woman who works in a meat-packing plant in rural Travis County, Texas, dies giving birth to a child in the back room of the building when she suddenly goes into labor. The cruel plant manager abandons the newborn in a dumpster. A local woman, named Luda Mae Hewitt, discovers the baby while searching for food. She names the infant Thomas and takes him to the Hewitt residence and raises the baby as her own son.Over the next 30 years, Thomas (Andrew Bryniarski) grows up and goes to work in the same slaughterhouse. When its horrid conditions cause the closure of his workplace, Thomas comes back and kills the slaughterhouse's owner with a sledgehammer; he also finds and takes a chainsaw. Charlie Hewitt (R. Lee Ermey), Luda Mae's (Marietta Marich) sadistic son, learns from Sheriff Winston Hoyt (Lew Temple) what Thomas has done, and accompanies the Sheriff to arrest Thomas. When they find Thomas, Charlie kills the Sheriff with a shotgun and takes his identity. Charlie and Thomas take the Sheriff's body home and butcher him for stew meat, telling the rest of the family that they will not leave their home even as the rest of the area becomes deserted.A few months later, in July 1969, two brothers, Eric (Matthew Bomer) and Dean (Taylor Handley), drive across the country with their girlfriends Chrissie (Jordana Brewster) and Bailey (Diora Baird). Eric and Dean are draft dodgers and are plotting to flee north to avoid being drafted into the U.S. Army where they will be sent to Vietnam. They stop at a local eatery where they encounter a group of bikers. As the group pulls away, a female biker, Alex (Cyia Batten), follows them. A chase ensues, ending with the group crashing into a cow and flipping their car. In the process, Chrissie gets thrown from the car and lands in the weeds, out of sight of the others. Charlie Hewitt/Sheriff Hoyt soon arrives on the scene; he immediately shoots Alex, throws her body into the trunk of his squad car, forces the rest of the group in as well, and calls for his...

Q: Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'. Watch out for Fake product on this card even though they are sold by Amazon<br /><br />I ordered one of these cards based on the good reviews on the product.  Amazon shipping was prompt as always.  The Card arrived in its original Asus packaging.  The first thing that i noticed was that the package seemed to be sealed differently with a long tape instead of shrink wrap or circular seal.  Another suspicious thing that was noticed was that there was a sticker over the UPC number.  But the card seemed to be as described from its looks.  I went ahead and installed it in the system and the first thing that was noticed was that the card does not install on the motherboard since the CPU fan was hitting against the BIOS battery.  I then went ahead and reviewed the diagrams on the card and it looked like the heatsink was mounted incorrectly, so went ahead and remounted the heat sink turning it around 180 degrees and now it fits properly on the motherboard.  Further all installations went smoothly and the system properly booted up.<br />So my thoughts at that point was that this was a quality control issue with ASUS.  After installing Windows 8.1 everything seemed to be working fine.  I then went ahead and installed the driver from ASUS and it seemed to go smoothly.  The system asked for a reboot and now windows started complaining that the driver for the video card is outdated and wanted to update it, and this is when i noticed that the card detected was a 6670 instead of 7250 which is one generation older.<br />I then went to AMD site and downloaded the driver and even that was detecting the card as a 6670 instead of 7250.  I decided to get more in-depth into this and started reviewing the card in detail and that is when i noticed that the card i received had a different mounting plate than what was given in the ASUS site and video outputs were all in the wrong places.<br />Called up Amazon and they agreed to send a replacement by next day air.  So hoping that the replacement card that i get will not be a fake one again. A:","output":"Negative Review The definition of a negative review is an evaluation or critique that expresses disapproval or dissatisfaction with a product or service. In this review, the customer faced several issues, such as receiving a product with a different manufacturing seal and incorrect heatsink mounting. Additionally, the video card was detected as one generation older than the advertised model, leading them to suspect that it was a fake product. Although Amazon agreed to send a replacement, the overall dissatisfaction and negative experience led me to classify this as a negative review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Keep the magazines you collect or want to reread at a later time. Set aside magazines with helpful information to come back to later. Then, recycle any magazines you no longer need. This will eliminate extra clutter from your home so your magazines will be organized and easy to access! If you prefer to keep things organized in alphabetical order, then arrange your issues by title so the magazines that start with “A” are on the left side, and the magazines starting with “Z” are on the right. Then, place your magazines in their appropriate place in between. If you have many magazines on the same subject, such as scrapbooking, cooking, or bodybuilding, then organize them categorically. For example, if you are looking for a new recipe for dinner, you can easily go to the “Cooking” section and locate an issue. File holders are small boxes or racks that allow you to display files, or in the case, magazines, vertically. After you choose your organizational method, put your magazines into the holders accordingly. You can fit 8-12 magazines in a standard file holder, depending on the thickness of your copies. For example, if you have many craft magazines and you want to organize them thematically, put all your craft magazines in the same holder. After you place all of your magazines in their respective holders, you should label them so you can easily locate individual issues. Write the name of the magazine, and include the issue numbers if you'd like.  You can write directly onto your magazine holders with a permanent marker, or use sticker labels and adhere them to the front of your holders.

Does \\"The latter is further divided into humoral (or antibody) and cell-mediated components.\\" correctly answer the question of What is one type of adaptive immune system component?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"The latter is further divided into humoral (or antibody) and cell-mediated components.\\" correctly answers the question of what one type of adaptive immune system component is by briefly mentioning the two primary components: humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity and cell-mediated immunity. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, let us delve into these components further. The adaptive immune system, also known as acquired immunity, is a highly specialized component of our overall immune system that is responsible for targeting and eliminating specific pathogens. It has the unique ability to \\"remember\\" past infections and respond more effectively to the same pathogens if they ever encounter them in the future. There are two main branches of the adaptive immune system: humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity. 1. Humoral immunity (antibody-mediated immunity): This branch of adaptive immunity deals with the production of antibodies specific to a particular pathogen. Antibodies are produced by B-cells, a type of white blood cell, after they encounter a foreign antigen (a substance recognized as foreign by the immune system). When B-cells encounter an antigen, they mature into plasma cells, which produce and release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies can then neutralize the pathogen by binding to the antigenic sites, preventing the pathogens from attaching to host cells and facilitating their destruction by other immune cells. A key aspect of humoral immunity is its ability to provide long-term protection through the formation of memory B-cells. These cells can persist following an infection and respond more rapidly and effectively if the same pathogen is encountered in the future. 2. Cell-mediated immunity: This branch of adaptive immunity focuses on the direct interaction between immune cells and infected or cancerous cells. T-cells, another type of white blood cell, play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. There are several types of T-cells, including helper T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and regulatory T-cells, each contributing to distinct aspects of the immune response. Helper T-cells (Th) recognize specific antigens and orchestrate the overall immune response by activating other immune cells, including B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells. Meanwhile, cytotoxic T-cells (Tc) directly target and eliminate cells infected with viruses or other intracellular pathogens, as well as cancerous cells, by releasing molecules that trigger cell death. Lastly, regulatory T-cells (Tregs) help modulate the immune response, maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. In summary, the statement correctly answers the question by briefly mentioning humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity and cell-mediated immunity as the two primary components of the adaptive immune system. Each branch plays a crucial role in recognizing and eliminating specific pathogens while providing long-term protection through immune memory formation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: What is tributary? A tributary is a term used to describe a subsidiary river or stream that flows into a more extensive and more prominent river system. It is an essential part of hydrological systems, as tributaries contribute to the flow of water in rivers, affecting the overall volume, sediment transport, and nutrient content. Moreover, they play a vital role in supporting various ecosystems, habitats, and biodiversity. Characteristics of tributaries can vary according to their size, geographic location, direction, and the type of surrounding terrain and environment. For example, some tributaries can be small, intermittent water courses (only flowing during rainy seasons) while others are large, perennial rivers with a constant flow throughout the year. Furthermore, tributaries can originate from different sources such as glaciers, rain, or springs. The interaction between tributaries and main rivers influences a wide range of ecological processes, including sediment deposition, channel formation, nutrient conservation, and water circulation. In turn, these processes affect the quality of water, plant and animal life, and various dependent habitats such as wetlands, marshes, or estuaries. Tributaries are significant not only in terms of their ecological contribution but also their cultural, socioeconomic, and historical impact. Many ancient civilizations and cities developed along the banks of large rivers and their tributaries to take advantage of fertile lands, water resources, communication, and trade networks. Second question: What is a tributary? This question is essentially asking the same thing as the first question. It seeks to understand the meaning and concept of a tributary in the context of hydrology and river systems. The detailed answer provided above, explaining the importance, characteristics, and functions of tributaries, would be an apt response to this question as well.  In conclusion, both questions are fundamentally inquiring about the same concept - understanding the nature and role of a tributary within a river system. The subtle difference in phrasing does not alter the subject matter or the intent with which these questions have been posed."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

The definition states that for each element in the list, we need to apply certain operations depending on whether the element is even or odd. The output should be a new list containing the results of these operations applied to the input list. Here's the approach I took: 1. Create an empty list called 'output_list' to store the results. 2. Iterate through each element in the input list. 3. For each element, check whether it is even or odd.     a. If the element is even, divide it by 4.     b.

Iterate through the input list.     - For 80 (even): Dividing 80 by 4 results in 20.     - For -5 (odd): Multiplying -5 by 4 and then adding 2 results in -18.     - For -19 (odd): Multiplying -19 by 4 and then adding 2 results in -74.     - For -70 (even): Dividing -70 by 4 results in -17.5.     - For 4 (even): Dividing 4 by 4 results in 1. 3. Every time the operations are applied on an element, it is added to the 'output_list'. 4. At the end of the iteration, 'output_list' now contains the following values: [20, -18, -74, -17.5, 1] So, the final output is [20, -18, -74, -17.5, 1]."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The hypothalamus is part of the brain and also secretes hormones, thus connecting the nervous and endocrine systems. The pituitary gland is the master gland of the endocrine system and controls other endocrine glands. Endocrine glands also include the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, and gonads.   Q: What is the master gland of the endocrine system?   A: OPTIONS: a). Thyroid. b). Hypothyroid. c). Thymus. d). pituitary gland. Answer:","output":"The master gland of the endocrine system is the pituitary gland, as mentioned in the given paragraph. It is responsible for controlling other endocrine glands, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating the body's hormones and overall function.  The pituitary gland, also known as the master gland, is a small, pea-sized structure located at the base of the brain. It is connected to the hypothalamus, which plays an essential role in linking the nervous and endocrine systems. The hypothalamus is responsible for triggering the release of hormones from the pituitary gland by secreting hormones that act on the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland comprises two distinct lobes: the anterior (front) lobe and the posterior (back) lobe. Each part of the gland releases various hormones that affect diverse processes in the body, including growth, reproduction, metabolism, thyroid function, and stress response. Other endocrine glands, including the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, and gonads, are also part of the endocrine system. These glands release hormones that regulate specific physiological processes. For example, the thyroid gland synthesizes hormones that control metabolism, and the adrenal glands produce hormones like cortisol, which is involved in responding to stress. In summary, the master gland of the endocrine system is the pituitary gland (Option d). It controls other endocrine glands and plays a vital role in managing hormone release and regulation throughout the body. The hypothalamus works closely with the pituitary gland, ensuring a strong connection between the endocrine and nervous systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does \\"In 1980 the PAIGC acknowledged in its newspaper Nó Pintcha (dated 29 November 1980) that many Gueinean soldiers had been executed and buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of Cumerá, Portogole, and Mansabá.\\" correctly answer the question of When did the PAIGC acknowledge the executions?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"In 1980 the PAIGC acknowledged in its newspaper Nó Pintcha (dated 29 November 1980) that many Gueinean soldiers had been executed and buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of Cumerá, Portogole, and Mansabá\\" correctly answers the question of when the PAIGC acknowledged the executions. The Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) is a political party in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde that played a significant role in the fight for independence from Portuguese colonial rule in the 20th century. As the statement indicates, the PAIGC publicly acknowledged the execution of many Gueinean soldiers and their burial in unmarked collective graves in November 1980. The acknowledgment occurred through their newspaper, Nó Pintcha, on 29 November 1980. Nó Pintcha, a publication controlled by the party, was an instrument used by the PAIGC to disseminate information, shape public opinion, communicate party policies, and, in this case, reveal previously concealed actions. By admitting to these executions and their clandestine burial sites in the woods of Cumerá, Portogole, and Mansabá, the PAIGC took responsibility for the incidents, thereby providing an official date for when the acknowledgment took place. Consequently, the provided statement accurately answers the question of when the PAIGC acknowledged the executions, as it specifies both the year (1980) and the exact date (29 November 1980) of this acknowledgment, along with the manner in which it was made public (through their newspaper Nó Pintcha)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...when did the last person in the civil war die??","output":"The last documented and verified surviving veteran from the American Civil War was Albert Henry Woolson, who passed away on August 2, 1956, at the age of 106. Woolson served as a drummer boy for Company C of the 1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery Regiment in the Union Army. Woolson was born in Antwerp, New York, on February 11, 1850, and later moved with his family to Minnesota. He enlisted in the Union Army as a young teenager towards the end of the Civil War in 1864. Although he didn't witness direct combat, Woolson was involved in guarding supply lines. The American Civil War, which occurred between the years 1861 and 1865, resulted in immense loss of lives while permanently shaping the course of American history and politics. Although Woolson didn't directly participate in combat, his death marked the end of an era as the last surviving veteran of the war. His passing was mourned by both the nation and veterans' organizations, which commemorated his life and the significance of the Civil War. It is important to mention that there have been other claims of Civil War veterans surviving past Woolson's death.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: Hyundai CEO tells where he'll take his hot brand next John Krafcik, CEO of Hyundai Motor America since 2008, has overseen fantastic growth, and now he has a different challenge: Keep the pot boiling at a time when he can't count on the spotlight and dealer enthusiasm that come with monthly sales records. That's because Hyundai's rocket ride up the U.S. sales chart is over -- because it can't make cars any faster. Hyundai is hitting full production capacity in South Korea, where most models sold in the U.S are made, and is adding a third shift this month at its Montgomery, Ala., plant that builds its two highest-volume U.S. models, Sonata and Elantra. VIDEO: Five questions with John Krafcik Much of the momentum Krafcik inherited was his own doing. Before he became CEO, Krafcik was vice president of product development and strategic planning. When he took that job in 2004, Hyundai's share of U.S. new vehicle sales was 2.5%, according to Autodata. Now, it's 5% and Hyundai is the seventh-biggest car company in the U.S., ranked by sales, behind the Detroit Three and Japan's top trio, Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Krafcik is sure the production limits will give his rivals advantages, especially in the midsize sedan segment, where seemingly every brand has a new model or soon will. \\"Competitors will take some demand away\\" from the Hyundai Sonata, but he professes himself \\"comfortable\\" with the sales he expects to get. And like all successful sales folk, he sees an opportunity in a limited supply: \\"I'd rather be a little bit short on production and long on quality,\\" he says. Rushing to crank out ever more vehicles can cause quality shortcuts, Toyota Motor CEO Akio Toyoda explained in 2010 to a U.S. congressional committee probing the company's sudden acceleration complaints, \\"I fear the pace at which we have grown may have been too quick,\\" he testified, and it may have \\"confused\\" the company about its priorities. In a session with USA TODAY reporters and editors, Krafcik offered a peek at Hyundai's future beyond the explosive sales gains. He has some contrary notions that'll keep Hyundai a very interesting company to watch. What's in Krafcik's crystal ball, on big issues and some not so big: Hyundai will field some alternative-power models -- already it is selling a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the Sonata, and a hydrogen-fueled car is due in 2015, he says -- but the future belongs to the venerable gasoline engine. It \\"will still be the majority (powerplant) in 30 years,\\" he says. Refined, evolved, downsized, engineered to a fare-thee-well, for sure, but still the recognizable internal combustion engine traceable to the first practical car, built by Karl Benz in 1886. Even Hyundai's hydrogen car won't be exclusively an alternative fuel model. \\"It would be a platform where we could also put in internal-combustion\\" engines. Nowadays the politically correct view is that non-petroleum power is the future. Nonetheless, others agree with Krafcik. One school of thought says that bio-fuels made from waste -- cornstalks or wood chips, for instance, instead of feed corn as is done now -- eventually could be produced in such quantities that they could be sold at the pump cheaper than gasoline. \\"Suddenly you have the same old engines but new environmentally acceptable fuels, and it's a whole new game,\\" says David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Auto Research and longtime observer of the auto industry. A report this month from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says lifetime costs associated with electric cars are \\"generally higher than those of a conventional vehicle or traditional hybrid of similar size and performance.\\" On average, CBO says, costs run 16,000 to 19,000 more than a comparable gas-engine vehicle. The CBO report says that an electric or plug-in hybrid would \\"require a tax credit of more than 12,000 to have the same lifetime costs\\" as a similar gas-only vehicle. The government currently gives a federal tax credit up to 7,500 for electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles for qualifying buyers. Hyundai was a pioneer of four-cylinder power when it introduced the redesigned 2011 Sonata midsize sedan only with four-cylinder engines, dropping the V-6 option. They are more sophisticated fours that use high-tech direct fuel injection for both better mileage and more power -- even though the technology is costlier and noisier. Direct injection is making its way into the mainstream, but when Sonata was launched it was mainly a premium-brand feature. \\"Four-cylinders are absolutely the future,\\" Krafcik says. Sonata's main rivals, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima, all still have optional V-6s, though Ford and General Motors are following the lead with only fours in the 2013 redos of their Ford Fusion and Chevrolet Malibu. \\"The Japanese have their V-6s because they don't have the turbo fours ready. They fell behind\\" in engine development, says Aaron Bragman, senior analyst at consultant IHS Automotive. Hyundai still has V-6s in the long-wheelbase version of its Santa Fe SUV, as well as V-6s and V-8s in its upscale Genesis and Equus models. Don't expect that to change immediately. In fact, the Genesis coupe got a more-powerful V-6 as part of its 2013-model update. Unique cars for unique markets \\"We don't believe in one-car-for-the-world, as some of our competitors do,\\" says Krafcik. \\"We view the American market as different from the European market. Rear-seat packaging (for example) is more important in the U.S.\\" That puts him head-on against his old employer, Ford Motor, which has pushed hard for uniform global designs in its One Ford strategy. That makes it possible to build any car at any of its factories around the world and requires only relatively small changes to suit various markets. Thus, it is cheaper and quicker to get models to market. Cars as mobile Internet connections This is one area where Krafcik agrees with the prevailing notions in the industry. \\"Moving nodes,\\" he calls cars of the future, and it's happening fast. Mazda claims that as part of its Skyactiv suite of technologies, it will cut vehicle weight 7% each time it renews a model. Hyundai cut about that much from the Santa Fe SUV in the redesign for 2013, from 3,725 down to 3,459 pounds. Lighter cars take less energy to move, so use less fuel. They also let automakers use smaller, lighter components, such as brakes and suspension parts. If the government's new fuel-economy standards remain set for 54.5 mpg in 2025, lightening will be increasingly important. Ford is believed to be planning an aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup for launch in 2014, which would cut about 700 pounds, or 15%, from the current model. Names for vehicles, not letters or numbers \\"We're not believers in alphanumerics,\\" he says. The industry has moved toward such designations as a mark of prestige. Lincoln MKZ, Cadillac XTS and Acura RDX, for example. Mainstream brands are sticking with names, such as Sonata, Malibu, Fusion, Altima and Optima. Shifting Hyundai from a low-price nameplate Hyundai is \\"making the transition from a value brand to a valuable brand,\\" he says. So the Elantra compact offers a heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, back-up camera and other features generally reserved for bigger, higher-priced cars. Of course, an Elantra compact so-equipped has a midsize price: 25,000. That's bad news for bargain-hunting car shoppers, but probably inevitable -- features or not -- as a result of Hyundai's maxed-out production. Anything in short supply gets more expensive. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are that John Krafcik, CEO of Hyundai Motor America, has overseen significant growth for the company during his tenure. However, Hyundai now faces production capacity limits in South Korea and must add a third shift at its Montgomery, Alabama plant to meet demand. Though alternative-power models are being developed, Krafcik believes that the gasoline engine will still dominate the market in 30 years. Four-cylinder engines are considered the future, with Hyundai leading the charge with its four-cylinder-only redesigned 2011 Sonata. Hyundai also does not believe in a one-car-for-the-world strategy and prefers to tailor models to suit different markets. Additionally, lighter cars are seen as a trend to keep an eye on for improving fuel efficiency, and Hyundai aims to become a \\"valuable brand\\" by offering high-end features on its vehicles while maintaining their competitive pricing."},{"instruction":"Q:- native name lang is mk    - native name is Бранко Црвенковски    - president is boris gligorov trajkovski ljupčo jordanovski kiro gligorov stojan andov kiro    - successor is gorge ivanov radmila Šekerinska -lrb- acting -rrb- ljubčo georgievski    - party is social democratic union    - spouse is jasna crvenkovska    - primeminister is radmila -lrb- acting -rrb- vlado bučkovski nikola gruevski Šekerinska -lrb- acting -rrb- hari kostov radmila Šekerinska    - office is 3rd president of macedonia prime minister of macedonia    - predecessor is boris trajkovski ljubčo georgievski nikola kljusev      - term end is 12 may 2009 12 may 2004 30 november 1998    - term start is 12 may 2004 1 november 2002 17 august 1992    - birth date is 12 october 1962      - image is branko-crvenkovski . jpg    - birth place is sarajevo , yugoslavia -lrb- now bosnia and herzegovina -rrb-    - religion is macedonian orthodoxy    - alma mater is saints cyril and methodius university of skopje    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

William James Dixon (July 1, 1915 - January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer. He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. Dixon left Mississippi for Chicago in 1936. A man of considerable stature, standing 6 and a half feet tall and weighing over 250 pounds, he took up boxing, at which he was successful, winning the Illinois State Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championship (Novice Division) in 1937. He became a professional boxer and worked briefly as Joe Louis's sparring partner, but after four fights he left boxing in a dispute with his manager over money.  Dixon met Leonard Caston at a boxing gym, where they would harmonize at times. Dixon performed in several vocal groups in Chicago, but it was Caston that persuaded him to pursue music seriously. Caston built him his first bass, made of a tin can and one string. Dixon's experience singing bass made the instrument familiar. He also learned to play the guitar.  In 1939, Dixon was a founding member of the Five Breezes, with Caston, Joe Bell, Gene Gilmore and Willie Hawthorne. The group blended blues, jazz, and vocal harmonies, in the mode of the Ink Spots. Dixon's progress on the upright bass came to an abrupt halt with the advent of World War II, when he refused induction into military service as a conscientious objector and was imprisoned for ten months. He refused to go to war because he would not fight for a nation in which institutionalized racism and racist laws were prevalent. After the war, he formed a group named the Four Jumps of Jive. He then reunited with Caston, forming the Big Three Trio, which went on to record for Columbia Records.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. This is a correct answer to the following question about Whole grain. Yes or no? Answer: Wheat Question: what are the elements in whole grain oats Answer:","output":"Whole grain oats contain three essential elements: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. Let me provide a detailed explanation of each element: 1. Bran: The outer layer of the grain is known as the bran. It is rich in fiber, antioxidants, and various essential minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus. The bran provides numerous health benefits, including supporting digestive health and maintaining regular bowel movements. 2. Germ: The germ is the reproductive part of the grain, from which a new plant can grow. It is an abundant source of B vitamins, vitamin E, healthy fats, and several phytonutrients. The germ plays a vital role in providing energy, supporting metabolism, and promoting overall health. 3. Endosperm: The largest part of the grain is the endosperm, which surrounds the germ. It contains complex carbohydrates, proteins, and small amounts of vitamins and minerals. The endosperm provides essential nutrients for the growing plant, and our bodies use these nutrients for energy and tissue maintenance. In conclusion, whole grain oats are made up of the bran, germ, and endosperm, which together offer a variety of vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and proteins that contribute to a balanced diet and overall health. So, the answer to the question would be \\"Yes\\" for elements in whole grain oats being wheat and \\"Yes\\" for bran, germ, and endosperm being the elements in whole grain oats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A former policeman stabbed his estranged wife to death at her hair salon in front of her horrified teenage colleague. In the months before her killing,  Ivan Esack, 38, had chillingly told Natalie, 33, ‘You’re a dead woman walking – tick tock, tick tock’, a court heard yesterday. He eventually fulfilled his alleged threat by knifing her up to 11 times in an attack that was so ferocious the blade bent. Murder case: Ivan Esack, 38, knifed Natalie Esack, 33, at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, in April up to 11 times with such ferocity that the blade bent and the tip broke off, Maidstone Crown Court was told. Mrs Esack’s 17-year-old salon. assistant Chelsea Ford wept as she told how after the killing, Esack. strode out on to the High Street, saying: ‘She deserved it, the bitch.’ Prosecutor Philip Bennetts described. Esack as ‘a violent and controlling person who was unable to deal with. the separation from his wife’ and killed her because he did not want her. to be with anyone else. The court was told of this chilling exchange between Esack and his wife on the day before her death. Tragedy: Floral tributes left at the scene of the stabbing at Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, in May. Esack: ‘I’ll catch up with you, don’t worry. You can’t ****ing hide from me, can you?’ Natalie: ‘What are my options?’ Esack: ‘Death, death or death.  You will see in the morning, and what I’m going to ****ing do to you won’t be funny.’ Cocaine-user Esack admits stabbing. his wife but denies murder, claiming he is guilty only of manslaughter. while his mind was unbalanced by ‘narcissistic personality disorder’ and. ‘substance abuse’. On location: Esack Hair and Beauty is pictured on Ashford High Street in Kent. As Ivan Esack strolled into the salon armed with the knife, his wife was on a computer at reception, the court heard. Maidstone Crown Court heard Esack and. his wife met around ten years ago and married in 2006. She later opened. Esack Hair and Beauty in Ashford, Kent, and counted Nancy Sorrell, 37,. wife of comedian Vic Reeves, among her clients. Although she ran her own. business, Mrs Esack’s husband was bullying and controlling, the jury. heard – never allowing his wife out without knowing where she was. One Christmas a few years ago she. suffered a badly swollen cheek and eye, Mr Bennetts said, after her. husband punched her. In July last year Mrs Esack told a relative he had. threatened her with a knife. Investigations: Forensic police officers take away the body of Natalie Esack from Esack Hair and Beauty in April. In October last year Mrs Esack left. the marital home and went to live with her brother. Mr Bennetts said. Esack then made such frightening threats to use his legally-held shotgun. to kill his wife, himself, and their dog, that she called the police. Esack voluntarily handed over the gun but continued with his abuse and threats, the court heard. During the separation, Mrs Esack. began a new relationship but just before last Christmas was persuaded to. return to her husband after he broke down crying. On Boxing Day, she went on a. make-or-break holiday to Mexico with Esack – but returned with a massive. bruise on her thigh, saying he had kicked her. The couple separated again and. abusive calls continued, the jury heard. Some were recorded by Mrs Esack. and were played in court. Esack was heard saying: ‘You’ve signed your. own death warrant’. Matters came to a violent end in. April after Mrs Esack went to a party with her new boyfriend and. accidentally called her husband. He heard the pair talking and became. aware of how serious her new relationship was. The next day, the court heard, he. bought a knife and went to her salon, stabbing his wife at the reception. desk. As she tried to flee, he grabbed her and continued to knife her. in the back. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This is a really sad and scary story. It's about a man named Ivan Esack who used to be a policeman.

Ivan said that he wasn't thinking clearly because he was taking something called cocaine, a very bad substance that can make people act differently, and he also had a problem with his personality. However, he is now going through a trial where people like judges and lawyers are trying to find out if he did what he's accused of on purpose or if it was because of his problems. It's a really serious situation and still ongoing so we don't know the final result yet.   Just so you know, hurting others or oneself is never a good thing, and might make people very sad. It's always better to ask for help and talk about our feelings, so we can solve our problems in a nice way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\",  answer the following question.

While the given options might provide a partial explanation, it would be more informative to explore a broader range of possibilities. Here are some potential reasons why it might have taken you a few weeks to find someone attractive: 1. Developing familiarity: Sometimes, attraction does not happen instantly. As you get to know someone over time, their personality, interests, and values can become more appealing, leading you to feel attracted to them. 2. Physical appearance: It is possible that the person's physical appearance changed over the weeks, either due to a change in clothing, hairstyle, or overall grooming habits. This may have sparked your newfound attraction. 3. Emotional connection: It may have taken a while for an emotional connection to develop between the two of you. Emotional connections are often necessary for attraction to occur, and they tend to develop with time as you interact more with the person. 4. Shared experiences: Over the weeks, you may have gathered more shared experiences with this person, which can contribute to increased attraction. The more positive experiences you have with someone, the more likely you are to find them attractive. 5. Changing personal priorities: Your priorities could have changed over time, leading you to be more open to developing attractions. Initially, you may have been more focused on other aspects of life, such as work, hobbies, or relationships with friends. 6. Social influence: There may have been a change in how others perceive this person, and this may have influenced how you see them. For example, if others suddenly started to express their admiration for this person or found them attractive, you may have been influenced by their opinions and begun to see the same qualities in them. In conclusion, while the given options might be true in some cases, attraction is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that can be influenced by numerous factors, both internal and external. It is essential to consider the bigger picture and examine various possibilities when trying to understand why it took a few weeks to find someone attractive."},{"instruction":"Q:Pick one category for the following text.
