Astronomy was Samuel's favorite subject in school but Jason didn't like it because","output":"of the complex concepts and calculations involved. However, the two friends always managed to find common ground in other areas, such as sports, music, and video games. They had been friends since kindergarten, and now, as high school sophomores, they had developed a deep understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses.  One day, their astronomy teacher, Mr. Hemsworth, announced that there would be a stargazing event at the local planetarium as part of an upcoming project. Attendance was optional, but the event had the potential to significantly boost the students' grades. Samuel's excitement was palpable, and although Jason wasn't particularly fond of astronomy, he agreed to attend the event as his best friend's emotional support.  The event was scheduled for a Saturday evening and coincided with a meteor shower that was expected to be visible from their town. The boys arrived at the planetarium early in order to secure the perfect spot. Samuel enthusiastically set up his telescope while Jason, not as interested in stargazing, focused on preparing some snacks they had brought with them for the evening. As the sky grew darker, more and more people arrived at the planetarium. Enthusiastic students, families, and amateur astronomers all gathered for what promised to be an unforgettable experience. Even Jason began to feel a growing sense of wonder at the sight of the community coming together over astronomy, a subject he'd once thought was boring and uninteresting. The meteor shower began at exactly 9:35 PM, just as predicted. Streaks of light crisscrossed the sky, eliciting gasps of awe and admiration from the gathered crowd. Samuel adjusted his telescope to capture the perfect view and invited Jason to take a look. Although Jason was still not a fan of the complexities of astronomy, he appreciated the beauty of the moment and felt a surge of happiness for his friend's excitement. As the evening wore on, Samuel pointed out several constellations and celestial bodies to Jason, explaining their significance and the myths and stories attached to them. To his surprise, Jason found himself becoming more and more enamored with the astronomical phenomenon taking place above their heads. The thought of the universe existing beyond their small town, with its billions of stars and mysteries waiting to be discovered, filled him with a sense of wonder and curiosity. The meteor shower reached its peak around midnight, sending dozens of shooting stars across the sky. Many of the attendees began making impromptu wishes as they witnessed the celestial event unfold. It was then that a remarkable thought struck Jason. Even though he didn't fully comprehend the mathematical and scientific concepts behind astronomy, he realized that there was an innate beauty and poetry to it all. History, mythology, and science were intertwined in the stars, and the boundlessness of the cosmos was both humbling and inspiring. As he continued to gaze up at the night sky, Jason found himself captivated by the vastness of space and the endless possibilities that lay within it.  When the event finally concluded, and the crowd began to disperse, Jason turned to Samuel with a newfound appreciation for the subject his best friend held so dear. \\"You know, Samuel,\\" he said thoughtfully, \\"maybe astronomy isn't so bad after all.\\" Samuel chuckled and clapped his friend on the back, grinning from ear to ear. \\"I knew I'd get you hooked one day, Jason,\\" he replied, confident that their friendship had reached a new level of understanding and mutual appreciation. From that day on, Jason took an active interest in astronomy, and the two friends often spent their evenings under the stars, sharing their thoughts and dreams about the universe and beyond, their friendship growing stronger with each passing night. And although the mathematical complexities of the subject still eluded Jason, he had come to understand that sometimes, it was the wonder, beauty, and the shared moments that truly mattered."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While a member of Blood Pollution, Chris was also a singer in a local church choir and had a pretty girlfriend, Emily Poule, who managed his band. Chris also worked as a photocopier technician.Chris and his compatriots go to a Steel Dragon concert. In the parking lot they paper every car in sight with flyers for their next gig.

Question 1: How did the British treat the native Maori when they first arrived in New Zealand? Did they treat them like the Indigenous Australians? Question 2: How did the U.K treat the Maoris when they first arrived on New Zealand? Choose from:  A). no.  B). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I'll begin by researching the British colonization of New Zealand and their interactions with the native Maori population, as well as the interactions between the British and the Indigenous Australians. Step 1: Research British colonization of New Zealand and their interactions with the Maoris During the early periods of British colonization, New Zealand was treated mostly as a possible site for future settlements. These settlements would be managed by the New Zealand Company, which was founded by Edward Gibbon Wakefield. The British aimed to trade and establish a partnership with the Maori people. In 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, which granted the British Crown sovereignty over New Zealand while acknowledging Maori ownership of land and allowing them rights as British citizens. Step 2: Research interactions between British colonizers and Indigenous Australians The colonization of Australia by the British began in 1788 when the First Fleet arrived in Sydney. The initial interactions were primarily characterized by a lack of understanding and occasional armed conflicts between the colonizers and Indigenous Australians. Unlike in New Zealand, no formal treaty was signed between the British colonizers and Indigenous Australians. Step 3: Compare the treatment of the two indigenous populations There were notable differences in the treatment of Maori people in New Zealand and Indigenous Australians. The Treaty of Waitangi established a foundation for partnership and cooperation between the British and Maori, while no such agreement existed in Australia. While both groups faced significant challenges and injustices, the Maoris had a more formal recognition of their rights when compared to Indigenous Australians. Now, I'll answer the questions based on the research: Question 1: The British treated the native Maori people in New Zealand with an intention to establish a partnership and cooperation, which led to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. This treatment was different from how they treated Indigenous Australians, who did not have a similar treaty and experienced more conflict. Question 2: Based on the information provided, the answer to this question is:  A). no. The answers to these two questions are different, as Question 1 is a descriptive answer explaining the treatment of the Maori people and the Indigenous Australians, while Question 2 is a multiple-choice question asking whether the treatment of the Maoris was similar or different."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We are given that the length is thrice its width, so we can write this as L = 3W. The area of the rectangular plot is given as 675 square meters, and since area = length × width, we can write this as A = L × W, or 675 = 3W × W. Multiplying the equation gives us 675 = 3W^2. To find W, we need to divide 675 by 3, which gives us: W^2 = 675/3 W^2 = 225 Now, finding the square root of both sides: W = √225 W = 15 meters So the width of the rectangular plot is 15 meters, which corresponds to option 'b'."},{"instruction":"Question: Q: What is the term for the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mother’s body until it hatches?

She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. In August, 1950, McDaniel suffered a heart ailment and entered Temple Hospital in semi-critical condition. She was released in October to recuperate at home, and she was cited by United Press on Jan. 3, 1951, as showing \\"slight improvement in her recovery from a mild stroke.\\"  McDaniel died of breast cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the hospital on the grounds of the Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, \\"I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias in my hair and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery\\"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today.  In 1999, Tyler Cassidy, the new owner of the Hollywood Cemetery (renamed the Hollywood Forever Cemetery), offered to have McDaniel re-interred there. Her family did not wish to disturb her remains and declined the offer. Instead, Hollywood Forever Cemetery built a large cenotaph on the lawn overlooking its lake. It is one of Hollywood's most popular tourist attractions.  McDaniel's last will and testament of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than 10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than 11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were there any other requests?","output":"Yes, Hattie McDaniel had some other requests in her will. She wanted a white casket and a white shroud, with white gardenias in her hair and in her hands, along with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs - The lungs expel through the nose or mouth back into the environment. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process of respiration is: 1. Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth: The process of respiration begins with the inhalation of air through the nostrils or mouth. As air enters the respiratory system, it passes through the nasal or oral cavity where it becomes filtered, moistened, and warmed. The air then travels through the pharynx (throat) and larynx (voice box) before it enters the trachea (windpipe). To summarize, the complete process of respiration should be as follows: 1. Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth: Air is inhaled through the nostrils or mouth and passes through the nasal or oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx before entering the trachea. 2. The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe: Inhaled air proceeds down the trachea, which branches into two bronchi, one for each lung. The bronchi further subdivide into smaller bronchioles, which ultimately terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli. 3. The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the bloodstream: The alveoli are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, allowing for the exchange of gases between the air and blood. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, while carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. 4. The carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is transferred to the air sacs: As the oxygen in the alveoli binds to hemoglobin and becomes part of the blood, the carbon dioxide that was previously bound to the hemoglobin is released. This carbon dioxide then diffuses across the alveolar walls, entering the air within the alveoli to be expelled from the body. 5. The lungs expel carbon dioxide through the nose or mouth back into the environment: Once the exchange of gases has taken place in the alveoli, the now carbon dioxide-rich air is carried back through the bronchioles, bronchi, and trachea during exhalation. The air passes through the larynx, pharynx, and finally, the mouth or nose, where it is expelled into the environment."},{"instruction":"Q:Facts:   - residence: south sioux city , nebraska    - state legislature: nebraska    - preceded: l. patrick engel    - party: democrat      - district: 17th    - term end: 2010    - succeeded: dave bloomfield    - term start: 2009    - state: nebraska    - birth date: 6 july 1955    - birth place: sioux city , iowa   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of robert giese .

The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge...

He noticed when he rolled his ball across the sand that it moved slower than when he rolled it across a wooden plank. This is because the _____ has less resistance. (A) wooden plank (B) sand  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"sand\\" and  \\"wooden plank\\". A:","output":"The ball moved slower when Ben rolled it across the sand compared to when he rolled it across the wooden plank. This was due to a difference in resistance offered by the two surfaces. In this scenario, the wooden plank has less resistance, making it easier for the ball to roll across and maintain its speed as compared to the sand. When an object, such as a ball, moves over a surface, it experiences resistance due to the contact between the object and the surface. This resistance, also known as friction, opposes the motion and causes the object to decelerate and eventually come to a stop. In the case of the sand, there is more resistance because the individual sand particles interact with the ball and each other, creating a greater frictional force. The irregular-shaped sand particles and the fact that they can shift position cause more surface area for friction to act upon. This increased friction slows the ball down more quickly than when it rolls over the wooden plank. On the other hand, the wooden plank is a more uniform and smooth surface. There is less contact area between the ball and the wooden plank, meaning there is less friction and resistance acting on the ball. As a result, when the ball rolls on the wooden plank, it is able to maintain its speed better and roll farther. In summary, the ball rolled slower when rolling on sand because of the increased resistance from the friction between the ball and the sand particles, whereas the ball rolled faster on the wooden plank due to less resistance offered by its smoother surface. Based on the question, the correct answer is \\"wooden plank.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The provided short movie review describes the movie as \\"bad,\\" which indicates a negative opinion. However, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the critic's perspective, it would be ideal to have a longer and more detailed review. A detailed movie review would cover various aspects of the film, such as the plot, the characters, the performances, the cinematography, the music, and the overall impact on the audience. In a more detailed review, the critic would discuss what specifically they found to be unsatisfactory about the movie. Were the performances subpar, or did the plot have inconsistencies that made the film confusing and unengaging? Did the movie fail visually, with poor special effects or uninspired cinematography? Was the music obtrusive and detracting from the movie-watching experience, or was the pacing too slow or too fast? A well-rounded review would also typically make note of any redeeming qualities the movie might have, despite the critic's overall negative opinion. For instance, the critic might point out an impressive performance from an actor or an interesting choice made by the director. Even if the critic concluded that the movie was \\"bad,\\" they might still acknowledge some bright spots worth praising. Moreover, within a detailed review, the critic would often compare the movie to other films within the same genre, examining if there are better alternatives available or if the movie stands out as a particularly weak example of its kind. The critic may also look at how the movie fares from a cultural or social perspective, assessing if it portrays relevant themes or tries to send a meaningful message – and if it succeeds in doing so.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.

I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\"? from the following article ?  During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since.

Help as much as you can. You are given a new situation: With my previous cell phone, in order to charge it I would have a plug the charger into the wall and the plug the cord into my phone to connect it to the electric source. With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly.  and a hint : Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.  Please answer this question : Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction? The answer to this question is:","output":"Your new cell phone is being charged using induction.

Summarize this article: (CNN) There's more to Eric Casebolt than the video that showed the former police corporal slamming a bikini-clad teenage girl to the ground in McKinney, Texas, his lawyer told reporters Wednesday.      And there's more to that day than those seven minutes caught on video, attorney Jane Bishkin said.      \\"The video that everyone has seen only depicts a small part of Eric's actions that day,\\" Bishkin said, noting that Casebolt had responded to two suicide calls earlier Friday.      Casebolt resigned on Tuesday, days after a YouTube video showing his response to reports of fighting at a McKinney pool party sparked swift allegations of racism.      Bishkin said the suicide calls Casebolt dealt with earlier in his shift that day took an \\"emotional toll\\" on the 10-year veteran of the force.      The officer's first stop of the day was an apartment complex, where a man had shot himself in the head in front of his family by the pool. Then, he headed to a home where a teenage girl was threatening to jump off her parents' roof. There, Casebolt helped calm the girl down so she could be taken to the hospital, Bishkin said.      When reports of possible trespassing at a pool in McKinney's Craig Ranch neighborhood came through, Casebolt was \\"reluctant to respond ... given what he had just been through,\\" his attorney said. But he felt it was duty to go to the scene after there were reports of \\"possible violent assaults,\\" she said. The video tells some of the story, but not all of it, his attorney said.      \\"With all that happened that day, he allowed his emotions to get the better of him,\\" Bishkin said. \\"Eric regrets that his conduct portrayed him and his department in a negative light. He never intended to mistreat anyone, but was only reacting to a situation and the challenges it presented. He apologizes to all who are offended. That day was not representative of the 10-year service to the community of McKinney, and it is his hope that by his resignation the community may start to heal.\\"      His attorney said that race had nothing to do with how the officer responded.      \\"He believed that those who fled were possible suspects,\\" Bishkin said. \\"He was not targeting minorities. In fact, he also detained a white female who you do not see on the video. His effort to gather information was hampered by some teenagers who were instructing others to defy police instructions.\\"      Bishkin said the former officer didn't appear at a press conference Wednesday because he's faced death threats since the video went viral.      \\"He's worried for his family. He's worried he may be followed,\\" she said. \\"And until that threat subsides, he's going to be in an undisclosed location.\\"      Police chief: He was out of control      Only one person was arrested after Friday's incident, and the charges against him were later dropped, police said Tuesday.      McKinney's police chief has called Casebolt's actions \\"indefensible,\\" but said it's too soon to say whether the former officer will face charges over what happened.      \\"Our policies, our training, our practice, do not support his actions,\\" Chief Greg Conley said. \\"He came into the call out of control, and as the video shows, was out of control during the incident.\\"      The police union defended the former officer.      \\"He was a dedicated and decorated officer who in this instance was placed in a high-stress environment that he was not fully prepared for,\\" Daniel Malenfant of the McKinney Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #107 told reporters, noting that Casebolt had won an \\"officer of the year\\" award in the past for his service.      Tackled girl: 'My back was hurting bad'      Dajerria Becton, the girl seen taken to the ground by Casebolt, told local station KDFW she had obeyed the officer's order to leave.      \\"He told me to keep walking,\\" she said. \\"And I kept walking, and then I'm guessing he thought we were saying rude stuff to him.\\"      That's when things got physical, she said.      \\"He grabbed me, twisted my arm on my back and shoved me in the grass and started pulling the back of my braids,\\" Becton told KDFW.      In the video, the officer places her hands behind her and kneels on her back.      \\"I was telling him to get off me because my back was hurting bad,\\" Becton said.      Becton wasn't charged, McKinney police said.      An attorney representing Becton said the 15-year-old has been having a hard time and sleeping and eating since the incident. She's shaken by what happened -- and by all the media attention that has turned the once-anonymous teenager into a face seen around the world, attorney Hannah Stroud told reporters.      Stroud said police violated Becton's civil rights, but she's still investigating what happened and trying to decide on her next steps.      At this point, one thing is clear, she said: Casebolt's resignation shouldn't put an end to the police investigation.      And no matter how difficult the officer's day was before he came to the pool, she said, nothing justifies how he responded.      \\"Each of us operates under stress. There are appropriate ways to handle stress,\\" she said, \\"and Officer Casebolt's actions were clearly in no way appropriate, and they also do not provide a defense for what occurred.\\" ||||| \\"He does recognize that his emotions got the best of him, and the prior suicide calls put him in an emotional place that he would have preferred not to been in when responding to this call,\\" Bishkin said. ||||| DALLAS (AP) — A white Texas police officer was not targeting minorities when he wrestled a black teenage girl to the ground and brandished his gun outside a pool party, his lawyer said, but rather was fraught with emotion after responding earlier to two suicide calls.

Casebolt... (Associated Press)      In this frame from video, McKinney law enforcement officials including Police Chief Greg Conley, front right, listen to Mayor Brian Loughmiller during a news conference at police headquarters, Tuesday,... (Associated Press)      As activists demanded Wednesday that prosecutors charge former officer David Eric Casebolt, his attorney Jane Bishkin said Casebolt apologizes for his treatment of the girl and to others offended by his actions Friday at a community pool in the Dallas suburb of McKinney.      \\"With all that happened that day, he allowed his emotions to get the better of him,\\" Bishkin said of her client, who is known to friends and family as Eric.      However, the attorney for Dajerria Becton, the 15-year-old girl whom Casebolt subdued, said that while her client's family appreciated Casebolt's apology, his stress is not an adequate defense.      \\"There are appropriate ways to handle stress, and Officer Casebolt's actions were in no way appropriate,\\" Hannah Stroud said Wednesday. Stroud also said the family will not decide on a next step until she and the city have completed their fact-finding, but they believe excessive force violated Dajerria's civil rights.      Casebolt's first call that day was to an apartment complex where a man had fatally shot himself in front of his wife and children, Bishkin said. The former officer of the year, who resigned Tuesday, then went to a home where a teenager was threatening to kill herself by jumping from the roof of her parents' home.      \\"Eric's compassion during these two incidents is a testament to his character,\\" Bishkin said, acknowledging that they had taken an \\"emotional toll\\" and made him reluctant to respond to the pool party. Ultimately, he did after hearing a violent assault had occurred, she said.      Cellphone videos taken by people at the pool show Casebolt running after black teens and ordering them to the ground, then forcing the teen girl onto her stomach and placing his knees on her back. At one point, he drew his firearm after two young black men charged forward in apparent protest of the girl's treatment but holstered the weapon when two other officers intervened.      Police say officers were responding to reports of teens unauthorized to use the pool who were jumping a fence to gain entry. Residents of the middle-class neighborhood have said teens attending an end-of-school party at the pool and adjacent park were acting unruly.      Local and national civil rights groups held a protest Wednesday in front of the McKinney Police Department, asking that prosecutors charge the 41-year-old ex-corporal for his actions. Police Chief Greg Conley has called his actions \\"indefensible.\\"      \\"We will keep on assembling and protesting until this officer is charged,\\" said Dominique Alexander with the Next Generation Action Network, based in the Dallas suburb of Grand Prairie.      Grand juries too often have sided with police accounts of violent encounters with minorities, according to Pamela Meanes, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Bar Association, the nation's oldest association of predominantly black lawyers and judges. That pattern has changed with the proliferation of cellphones, she told media.      \\"I wonder what the narrative would be if there was no tape from this particular scene,\\" she said.      Bishkin said Casebolt was \\"not targeting minorities,\\" adding, \\"he also detained a white female, who you do not see on the video.\\"      The protesters did not specify what charge should be filed against Casebolt, but Heath Harris, a former Dallas County prosecutor who's representing the one person charged in the fracas, said video appears to show Casebolt could be accused of a misdemeanor count of official oppression, which covers the mistreatment or unlawful detention of people by a public servant. The Collin County district attorney's office did not respond to a call seeking comment.      Meanes acknowledged teens at the pool should have done more to comply with police orders.      \\"I think it's a good opportunity for America to have a conversation about mutual respect,\\" she said.      McKinney police have said charges, including evading arrest, against Harris' client, 18-year-old Adrian Martin, will be dropped. Harris said Martin does not intend to sue for being arrested and jailed.      \\"What his family is more interested in is making sure other kids don't find themselves in a similar situation,\\" Harris said.      Meanwhile, Bishkin said death threats against Casebolt have forced him and his family to leave their home for an undisclosed location.      Daniel Malenfant, president of the McKinney Fraternal Order of Police, said Casebolt hopes his resignation will \\"restore peace in the community.\\"      \\"He was a dedicated and decorated officer, who in this instance was placed in a high-stress environment that he was not completely prepared for,\\" Malenfant said.      ___      Associated Press reporters Jill Craig in McKinney and Jamie Stengle in Dallas contributed to this report. |||||","output":"Former police officer Eric Casebolt's lawyer, Jane Bishkin, has spoken out about the incident in which Casebolt was recorded slamming a teenage girl to the ground at a pool party in McKinney, Texas.

Computer security Computers control functions at many utilities, including coordination of telecommunications, the power grid, nuclear power plants, and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks. The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected, but the Stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable to physical damage caused by malicious commands sent to industrial equipment (in that case uranium enrichment centrifuges) which are infected via removable media. In 2014, the Computer Emergency Readiness Team, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies. Q: How did the Stuxnet worm infect industrial equipment?","output":"The Stuxnet worm infected industrial equipment through a multi-step process: 1. Initial Infection: Stuxnet primarily spread through infected removable media, such as USB drives. When a user unknowingly plugged an infected USB drive into a computer, the worm would automatically execute itself, exploiting a vulnerability in the way Windows processed shortcut files. 2. Privilege Escalation: Once executed, Stuxnet would exploit several other vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system to escalate its privileges, giving it greater control over the infected computer. 3. Propagation: After gaining control, Stuxnet would search for other vulnerable computers on the same network to infect. It utilized multiple propagation techniques, including copying itself to shared network resources and exploiting a vulnerability in Windows Print Spooler. 4. Target Identification: Stuxnet was designed to specifically target industrial control systems (ICS) using Siemens Step7 software, which is commonly used to manage Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). When Stuxnet found a suitable target, it would intercept and monitor communications between the infected computer and the PLC. 5. Payload Delivery: The ultimate goal of Stuxnet was to sabotage the target system, in this case, uranium enrichment centrifuges. It achieved this by modifying the PLC's programming code, causing the centrifuges to spin at speeds that would eventually damage them, while simultaneously sending false feedback to make the system look like it was functioning normally. In summary, the Stuxnet worm infected industrial equipment by initially spreading through removable media, propagating through networks, identifying specific target systems, and ultimately delivering its payload to sabotage the equipment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What are the full names of the people who completed the first high-rise building in Chicago?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888.

Please answer this question: The organic chemical compound C12H22O11 is better known as what additive?","output":"The organic chemical compound C12H22O11 is better known as sucrose, a common additive used primarily as a sweetening agent in various food products and beverages. Sucrose, which is composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms, is a disaccharide carbohydrate sugar that is obtained mainly from sugar cane and sugar beet. It is often referred to simply as sugar, table sugar, or cane sugar. Sucrose is formed through the combination of a glucose molecule (C6H12O6) and a fructose molecule (C6H12O6) with the removal of a water molecule (H2O). The resulting structure, which can also be represented as (C6H11O5)2, is a non-reducing sugar that can be hydrolyzed to yield glucose and fructose in a 1:1 ratio. This hydrolysis typically occurs during digestion in humans, breaking down sucrose into glucose and fructose, which are then absorbed through the small intestine and utilized as energy sources by the body. As an additive, sucrose is a popular choice for sweetening food products and beverages due to its pleasant taste, relatively low price, and versatile applicability. It's been used for centuries in various culinary applications, such as baking, cooking, and preserving food items. In addition to its sweetening properties, sucrose can contribute to the texture, stability, and mouthfeel of food items as well. Some potential drawbacks of excessive sucrose consumption include tooth decay, obesity, and other health-related problems that may arise due to the overconsumption of added sugars. Moreover, a subset of the population with a rare genetic disorder called hereditary fructose intolerance cannot safely metabolize fructose and should thoroughly avoid consuming sucrose.

Given the following context:  Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963.   When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Holst was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 in 1977, decided she would retire as artistic director after that year's festival. She made her...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who gave up the conductorship of the Purcell Singers in 1967?

Benjamin likes to stuff bell peppers when Robert comes over, but","output":"this time he wanted to surprise his friend with something new and exciting. Benjamin always enjoyed cooking and experimenting with unique recipes, but this time he had a strong desire to outdo himself. Benjamin started planning a few days before Robert's visit. He browsed through a myriad of cookbooks, watched countless cooking shows, and scoured the internet for fresh ideas. He even called his mother, a fantastic chef in her own right, for some suggestions. A mixture of cuisines and flavors inundated his mind, making it difficult to make a decision. Ultimately, Benjamin narrowed his list down to three potential dishes: a Moroccan tagine with lamb and apricots, Thai-style basil chicken with aromatic jasmine rice, and stuffed zucchini boats filled with quinoa and roasted vegetables. Realizing that he could not make the decision alone, he sought advice from his sister Amelia, a fellow food enthusiast and his most trusted critic. After discussing the options with Amelia, Benjamin decided to prepare an elaborate three-course meal for Robert. He finalized the menu, which included a Vietnamese fresh spring roll appetizer, followed by the Moroccan tagine as the main course, and a decadent chocolate mousse for dessert. This menu catered to a symphony of different flavors, textures, and cultures, an experience he believed Robert would never forget. The day before Robert's visit, Benjamin went to the local farmers market to search for the freshest and finest ingredients. He picked up colorful bell peppers, ripe tomatoes, crisp baby spinach, succulent lamb, aromatic herbs, fragrant spices, and other ingredients that would paint a picturesque culinary canvas. On the day of the dinner, Benjamin woke up early, ready to tackle the ambitious menu. He started by marinating the lamb in an enchanting mixture of spices, allowing it to soak in the nuanced flavors for hours. He then prepared the chocolate mousse, carefully melting chocolate and meticulously folding it into whipped cream. As the evening approached, Benjamin worked tirelessly in the kitchen, ensuring that every element of the meal was cooked to perfection. The fragrances wafting through his home were intoxicating, further fueling his motivation to create an unforgettable feast. When Robert arrived, he was in awe of the beautiful tablescape that Benjamin had set. Elegant linen napkins, sparkling silverware, and an unpretentious bouquet of wildflowers graced the table, accentuating the warm and inviting atmosphere. They started with the Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, delighting in the symphony of textures and flavors - tender shrimp, crisp vegetables, fragrant mint, and the tangy dipping sauce that tied all the elements together. As they moved on to the Moroccan tagine, Robert's eyes widened at the first taste of the tender, spiced lamb and sweet apricots, perfectly complemented by a fluffy bed of couscous. The combination of bold flavors and the lamb's melt-in-your-mouth texture resulted in a dining experience that exceeded both of their expectations. Finally, it was time for dessert. The rich, velvety chocolate mousse offered the perfect ending to the exquisite meal, its decadent flavors serving as a celebration of their friendship. Throughout the evening, Benjamin and Robert savored each dish, discussing the recipes and the art of cooking, as well as sharing stories and laughter. It was through this shared love of food that their friendship had blossomed, and Benjamin felt immense satisfaction in knowing that he had not only surprised his friend but also created memories that would last a lifetime. This culinary journey they embarked on together proved that bonds forged in the kitchen were ones that could withstand the test of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -2371*w + 2630*w + 3626 = 0 for w.","output":"To find the solution for w, we need to isolate w on one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the given linear equation: 1) First, simplify the equation by combining the w-terms.  -2371w + 2630w = 259w (since -2371 + 2630 = 259) Now, the equation becomes: 259w + 3626 = 0 2) Next, we want to isolate w by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we need to subtract 3626 from both sides. 259w + 3626 - 3626 = 0 - 3626 This simplifies to: 259w = -3626 3) To completely isolate w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 259. 259w / 259 = -3626 / 259 When we perform the division, we get the following result: w = -14 (approximately) So, the solution for the given equation, -2371w + 2630w + 3626 = 0, is w ≈ -14."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that had their hand out to a 1-foot-tall gnome? , can you please find it?   In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Who played bass guitar in the Beatles?","output":"Paul McCartney played bass guitar in the Beatles, one of the most influential and groundbreaking bands in the history of popular music. McCartney, born on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool, England, was a co-founder of the band alongside John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. In addition to playing bass guitar, McCartney was also a singer, songwriter, and occasional guitarist and keyboardist for the Beatles. The Beatles were initially formed in Liverpool in 1960, but it wasn't until 1962 that McCartney assumed the role of bass guitarist. Before becoming the band's bassist, McCartney primarily played rhythm guitar and piano. When the original bass player, Stuart Sutcliffe, left the band to pursue a career in art, McCartney took over that role, with some reluctance. Initially, McCartney played the bass using a Höfner 500/1 violin bass, which eventually became his signature instrument. This bass had a symmetrical double-cutaway body design, making it easy to use for left-handed players like McCartney. Throughout his tenure with the Beatles, Paul McCartney would also play the Rickenbacker 4001S, Epiphone Casino, and Fender Jazz bass guitars. As a bassist, McCartney quickly became innovative in his style, incorporating influences from Motown, R&B, and jazz. He developed a melodic approach to the instrument that was different from most rock bands of the era, emphasizing countermelodies and often utilizing chord progressions to complement the main vocal lines. As a result, McCartney's bass lines were not just the foundation but also an integral part of the overall compositions. McCartney contributed significantly to the band's songwriting efforts as well. Together with John Lennon, he became part of one of the most successful songwriting duos in music history – Lennon-McCartney. They wrote many of the Beatles' hit songs and classics, including \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Let It Be,\\" \\"Yesterday,\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" among others. The Beatles' catalog showcases McCartney's versatility in different musical styles, ranging from tender ballads to hard rock songs. The Beatles disbanded in 1970, but Paul McCartney's career was far from over. He went on to form the band Wings, with his wife Linda McCartney, and released several successful albums as both a solo artist and with his new group. Throughout his career, McCartney continued to play bass guitar and make significant contributions to music, garnering immense accolades for his exceptional musicianship, songwriting, and impact on popular culture. In summary, Paul McCartney played bass guitar in the Beatles and made a profound impact on the development of popular music with his innovative playing and exceptional songwriting skills. His influence can still be heard today in countless bands and artists inspired by the enduring legacy of the Beatles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two friends met after 20 years. Tom had been smoking tobacco all these years and had some health problems related to that, while Randy quit smoking 25 years ago.  Which friend had a lower risk of developing cancer of the throat?","output":"Between Tom and Randy, Randy has a significantly lower risk of developing cancer of the throat due to his decision to quit smoking 25 years ago. Smoking tobacco is one of the primary risk factors for developing throat cancer, as it exposes the cells in the throat to dangerous chemicals and carcinogens. In Tom's case, he has been smoking tobacco consistently for the past 20 years. This prolonged exposure to carcinogens increases the risk of genetic mutations and cellular damage in his throat, which may result in cancerous growths. Additionally, Tom's health problems related to his smoking habit further emphasize the potential detrimental impact on his overall wellness and specifically increase the risk for throat cancer. On the other hand, Randy quit smoking 25 years ago, which means his body has had ample time to repair some of the damage caused by smoking. The human body is remarkably resilient and capable of healing from the effects of smoking. Within a couple of years after quitting, individuals typically experience a significant decrease in their risk of developing smoking-related health problems such as cancer. Since Randy quit smoking 25 years ago, his body has likely healed a significant portion of the damage sustained during his smoking years. As a result, his risk of developing throat cancer is considerably lower than Tom's. It's worth noting that quitting smoking is one of the most effective steps an individual can take to reduce their risk of various cancers, including throat cancer. The sooner a person quits smoking, the better their chances of reducing associated health risks. However, it's essential not to discount the fact that Randy was a smoker at some point in his life. This means that his risk for developing throat cancer, although significantly lower than Tom's, is still elevated when compared to someone who has never smoked at all. Nonetheless, Randy's decision to quit smoking 25 years ago substantially improved his health prospects and decreased his likelihood of facing severe smoking-related health complications in the future, including throat cancer. In summary, both friends have had a history of smoking, which increases the risk of developing throat cancer. However, Randy quit smoking 25 years ago, allowing his body to repair much of the damage caused by smoking, resulting in a considerably lower risk for throat cancer in comparison to Tom, who has continued to smoke all these years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As well as short films , the studio made a few feature films , such as Ruddigore ( late 1960s ) . The company was sold to Tyne Tees Television in the early 1970s , although Halas and Batchelor themselves broke away from this association after a few years . Most of the 2,000 films now form part of The Halas and Batchelor Collection in 1996 . This collection was part of a donation by the couple 's daughter to the British Film Institute in 2010 .  - Joy Batchelor (12 May 1914 in Watford, Hertfordshire  14 May 1991 in London) was an English animator, director, screenwriter, and producer.

This fictional character was the main protagonist of the well-known American television medical drama series, \\"House,\\" which aired on the Fox network from 2004 to 2012. Dr. Gregory House, portrayed by British actor Hugh Laurie, was the head of the Department of Diagnostic Medicine at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Known for his unconventional approach to medicine, his sarcastic wit, and his unique problem-solving skills, Dr. House built and led a team of specialized doctors to help him diagnose unusual and complex cases, often resorting to unorthodox treatments. In the earlier seasons, Dr. House's original diagnostic team consisted of Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), a neurologist with a background in criminal psychology; Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), an intensivist and surgeon from Australia; and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), an immunologist with a strong moral compass. Throughout the series, this team assisted Dr. House in diagnosing and treating various mysterious illnesses, often facing numerous ethical and medical challenges along the way. Following the conclusion of a few seasons, much of the original team departed from the Department of Diagnostic Medicine for various reasons, and Dr. House sought to form a new team. He began a so-called \\"reality show\\"-style hiring process during Season 4, which involved interviewing and testing numerous medical professionals for their ability to think creatively, perform under high-pressure situations, and effectively contribute to the diagnostic process. By the end of this process, Dr. House chose Dr. Remy \\"Thirteen\\" Hadley (Olivia Wilde), a specialist in internal medicine and genetic medicine with a complex personal history; Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a skilled plastic surgeon with a knack for understanding human behavior; and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist with a talent for outside-the-box thinking. With the new team in place, Dr. House continued to tackle difficult diagnostic cases, using his extraordinary medical intuition and sheer persistence to save lives and uncover the truth behind various illnesses. Throughout the remainder of the series, the team underwent several changes and challenges, as members occasionally departed and returned, each contributing their unique skills and perspectives to the ongoing storylines and medical mysteries encountered by Dr. House and his colleagues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.âMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent.

Sci-Fi films such as Minority Report show people controlling computer programmes with expansive hand gestures. And now there's a gadget called Flow that will allow users to do just that, which could one day replace the computer mouse. Flow is designed to be more sensitive than a mouse and will allow people to edit documents, draw and control apps by touching it or swiping in mid air above the gadget. Flow, a gadget that responds to gestures and touch could be used to edit documents, draw and control apps, replacing the computer mouse. It can be programmed with shortcuts for more than 30 applications, enabling users to control Spotify with the flick of their wrist or use it to manipulate images in Photoshop. The gadget, designed by engineers in Berlin, Germany, works alongside a desktop or laptop via a Bluetooth connection, with apps such as Final Cut Pro X, SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube. The engineers and computer scientists are raising money on crowd funding site Indiegogo to put Flow into production. Flow (pictured) works alongside a desktop or laptop via a Bluetooth connection, with apps such as Final Cut Pro X, SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube. For example, a user could programme the device to skip tracks in a Spotify playlist by swiping in mid-air over the device. Flow  will allow users to manipulate images and documents using hand gestures, such as in sci-fi films like Minority Report (a screenshot is pictured) - without the light-up gloves. To begin with, the device will support Macs, with iOS devices, Android, Windows and Linux support in the pipeline. It could be used alongside work equipment or in the home (pictured) which may mean that smart appliances could one day be controlled using the simple device. Description: A programmable wireless controller that is small enough to fit in a pocket and could one day replace the computer mouse. Materials: A metal ring and polycarbonate touch surface. Connectivity: Bluetooth LE/4.1. Compatibility: Macs, with more operating systems in the pipeline - starting with 30 popular apps. Battery: Four months. Size: Almost three inches (7cm) in diameter and half an inch (1.5cm) high. Sensors: 360° angular positioning, capacitive touch, light and infrared hand gesture recognition.

Keyboard and mouse are great but they are far from giving you the same sensitivity and abilities as your hand. ‘The same applies for music, browsing or presentations. We need a tool that gives us flexible shortcuts and perfect control, a tool that makes the things we love fast, precise, intuitive and fun. ‘That's why we created Flow, a freely programmable wireless controller.’ The team combined three technologies into their small circular device so it can recognise hand gestures, sensitive touch and precise haptics (such as being tapped) via sensors. They say that controls for more than 30 popular applications will be available at launch with more becoming available week by week. ‘Let us know which shortcuts or controls are important to you and we'll get right to work,’ they wrote. The engineers creayed Flow beacuse they said that the computer mouse is ' far from giving you the same sensitivity and abilities as your hand,' whereas their gadget has more sensing capabilities. he team combined three technologies into their small circular device (pictured in a work situation) so it can recognise hand gestures, sensitive touch and precise haptics via sensors.

Hypothesis: A girl is outside playing volleyball. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis given the premise. The information provided in the premise does not support the hypothesis. They contain two different scenarios.  In the premise, we have a girl playing in a house, positioned between a window and a stack of shelves. Based on this, we don't know what she's playing with or what kind of activity she's engaged in, but it is clear that she is indoors. The environment is defined by the interior features such as a window and a stack of shelves. Other than that, the premise doesn’t give us any piece of information about the girl’s actions other than she is playing. On the other hand, the hypothesis presents a completely different situation where a girl is outside and specifically playing volleyball. Playing volleyball typically requires an outdoor setting or a substantially-sized indoor setting (like a sports hall) to accommodate for the game's requirements. It's a team sport that involves a volley ball and a net, and a significant amount of space for players to move around. The two situations are contrasting in terms of location (inside vs. outside), activity (unspecified vs. playing volleyball), and the environment (between a window and shelf vs. likely in a field or a court).  In order for the premise to support the hypothesis, we would need additional information that creates a bridge between the indoor play setup and the outdoor volleyball activity. Something like \\"The girl went outside after playing in the house and started playing volleyball\\" could effectively link the premise to the hypothesis. However, with the current given premises, there's no direct correlation or link that would allow us to deduce the hypothesis from the premise.

Write a question about the following article: Henry Grey matriculated at Trinity College in 1615, and was granted an M.A. that year, during the visit of King James I of England. He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament. After a period of retirement, he declared for King Charles II of England during a rising in August 1659, and was arrested, but was soon released.

Thor (Bryan Grant) shows his alien contempt for Earth's creatures by vaporizing a dog named Sparky. Crew member Derek (David Love), after discovering an inscription on Sparky's dog tag, fears that the Gargon might destroy Earth's native inhabitants. This makes the other aliens scoff at the thought. Being members of the \\"supreme race\\", they disdain \\"foreign beings\\", no matter how intelligent; they pride themselves that \\"families\\" and \\"friendships\\" are forbidden on their world. Derek turns out to be a member of an alien underground that commemorates the more humane periods of their world's history. Their one Gargon seems to be sick in Earth's atmosphere. While his crew mates are distracted, Derek leaves. Eventually, the Gargon seems to revive. When the Captain reports his actions, Derek is quickly connected to their Leader (Gene Sterling); Derek, it turns out, is the Leader's son, although Derek is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to kill him in order to protect their mission to Earth. They return to their base, leaving the Gargon behind. Meanwhile, Derek finds the home address he found on the dog's tag. There he meets Betty Morgan (Dawn Anderson) and her Grandpa Joe (Harvey B. Dunn).

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"Ayam penyet is a popular traditional Indonesian and Malaysian dish that has gained widespread recognition not only in its regions of origin but also among food enthusiasts from all around the world. Its origins can be traced back to Java, one of the major islands in Indonesia. The dish is known for its distinctive preparation method, unique flavor profile, and its cultural significance in the culinary scenes of both Indonesia and Malaysia.  In its essence, Ayam penyet is made up of three main components, namely: the marinated and fried chicken, the spicy sambal, and the steamed rice. However, these elements often come with a variety of side dishes and garnishes that further elevate the taste and presentation of the meal. 1. Marinated and fried chicken: The primary star of Ayam penyet is the chicken. The chicken is typically marinated in a combination of spices and herbs, such as garlic, shallots, coriander, turmeric, and galangal, before being deep-fried to achieve a tender and juicy texture on the inside and crispiness on the outside. The marinating process ensures that the chicken is infused with the rich and flavorful essence of the spices, creating an unforgettable taste. 2. Spicy sambal: The sambal is a crucial element in Ayam penyet as it adds an extra layer of spice and flavor to the dish. This fiery condiment is made from a blend of crushed fresh red and green bird's eye chilies, garlic, shallots, tomatoes, and shrimp paste, among other ingredients. The end result is a tangy, spicy, and slightly sweet sauce that complements the chicken perfectly. Some variations might also include additional ingredients like fermented soybean (tempeh) or roasted peanuts. 3. Steamed rice: Ayam penyet is traditionally served with steamed white rice, providing a filling and neutral base upon which the bold flavors of the chicken and sambal can shine through. The fluffy rice pairs wonderfully with the rich flavors of the dish, helping to balance out the intense spice levels of the sambal. Aside from the main components, Ayam penyet is often garnished with fresh vegetables such as cucumber, tomatoes, and lettuce to add a refreshing crunch, as well as a serving of tempeh or tofu for added protein. Another unique aspect of the dish is the way it is served - the fried chicken is often \\"penyet\\" or \\"smashed\\" with a mortar and pestle to flatten it, making it easier to absorb the flavors of the sambal and other accompanying ingredients. The widespread popularity of Ayam penyet in Malaysia can be attributed to the shared cultural and historical ties between Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as the influences of Javanese cuisine on Malaysian food. The dish has become increasingly common in Malaysia, with numerous restaurants and street food stalls offering their own unique renditions of Ayam penyet. The dish has become a beloved staple in the Malaysian culinary scene, reflecting the rich multicultural heritage that has shaped the country's diverse range of flavors and dishes. In conclusion, Ayam penyet, with its deep-rooted regional origins and rich, savory taste, has become a cherished culinary delicacy that showcases the unique heritage and flavors of both Indonesia and Malaysia. Its methodical preparation of marinated and fried chicken, fiery sambal, and steamed rice helps to create a harmonious blend of textures and flavors that continue to captivate food lovers from all walks of life. As Ayam penyet continues to grow in popularity, it serves as an enduring testament to the power of food in uniting people and cultures across borders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. swords were placed as gifts in rich men’s graves and a sword could also be used as an offering to the divine powers, which inhabited the lakes and bogs. Make this proper case","output":"Swords have played a significant role in various cultures throughout human history, not only as tools of warfare and status symbols, but also as meaningful objects in religious and spiritual practices. In many ancient societies, swords were placed within the graves of wealthy individuals as gifts, signifying their power and importance in their lifetime. Furthermore, swords were also used as offerings to divine powers that were believed to inhabit lakes, bogs and other natural landscapes. In the case of swords as grave goods, these were typically placed alongside the bodies of the deceased to represent their social standing, military prowess, and authority during their lives. This practice was common in various European cultures, such as the Norse, Celts, and Anglo-Saxons, who considered the sword to be an integral part of a warrior's identity and a symbol of honor. For these societies, the burial of a sword with its owner served as a testament to their achievements in life and ensured their elevated status in the afterlife. In many instances, swords were even personalized for their owners, boasting intricate designs and craftsmanship that showcased the skill of the swordsmith, as well as the power and wealth of the owner. The quality and decorative elements of the sword acted as a visual representation of the individual's accomplishments, and the inclusion of these items in their graves signified the continuation of their influence beyond death. In addition to being burial items, swords also held a significant spiritual and religious importance. Many ancient societies believed that divine powers or spirits resided in natural landscapes, such as lakes, bogs, and rivers. These beliefs led them to make offerings to these entities in the form of valuable objects, including swords, as a way to gain favor and protection. Swords were often chosen for these sacrificial offerings due to their symbolic ties to protection, power, and authority. Rituals involving the deposition of swords in bodies of water were often elaborate affairs, designed to appease the divine beings and ensure the continued prosperity and safety of those making the offerings. In some cases, these offerings were made during periods of unrest or uncertainty, as a plea for protection or assistance from the divine beings. In other instances, the deposition of swords might have been a gesture of gratitude after a successful endeavor, such as a battle or an abundant harvest. Regardless of the specific circumstances surrounding these rituals, the inclusion of a sword in these offerings was a significant and meaningful act. In conclusion, swords held a dual purpose in the lives of many ancient cultures, serving both as symbols of personal power and as objects of spiritual and religious significance. The inclusion of these weapons as gifts in the graves of wealthy individuals and offerings to divine powers highlights the multifaceted nature of these items and the lasting impact they had on the societies that utilized them. Today, the discovery and study of these ancient swords provide valuable insights into the beliefs, practices, and values of past cultures, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of our shared human history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: How do I hide the screw heads when making a worm bin for apartments>","output":"To hide the screw heads when making a worm bin for apartments, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: In order to create a worm bin, you'll need the following materials:    - A plastic or wooden container with a lid    - Drill or an awl    - Screws (flat head, countersunk screws are best for this purpose)    - Screwdriver or a power drill with a screwdriver bit    - Sandpaper    - Wood glue (if using wooden boards or panels)    - Wood filler or plastic filler (depending on the container material)    - Vernier caliper or a ruler    - Paint and paintbrush (optional) 2. Measure and mark screw locations: Before drilling, measure and mark the locations where you want to put the screws. This will ensure even spacing and help you avoid any potential mistakes. Make sure to mark the spots in less visible areas, like at the corners or sides of the bin. 3. Pre-drilling holes: Carefully pre-drill the holes into the container material for each marked screw location. This will prevent the material from cracking or splitting when you insert the screws. Ensure the drill bit's diameter is slightly smaller than the screw's diameter. 4. Countersink the holes: Next, countersink the holes using a countersink bit on your drill. This will create a tapered hole that will allow the flat head screws to sit flush with the bin's surface. Make sure not to go too deep, as this might weaken the structure. 5. Assemble the bin: Assemble the worm bin by using wood glue and screws on parts that needed to be attached. Insert each screw into a countersunk hole and fasten it using a screwdriver, ensuring it sits flush with the surface. 6. Fill the gaps: To hide the screw heads completely and create a smooth surface, apply wood filler or plastic filler over the recessed screw heads. Let the filler dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. 7. Sand the surface: Once the filler is dry, use sandpaper to smooth out the filler-filled areas and blend them in with the rest of the container. This will ensure that the heads of the screws are hidden and will be less noticeable. 8. Paint the bin (optional): If you want to give your worm bin a more aesthetically pleasing appearance, consider applying a coat of paint. This can help further conceal the screw heads and give your bin a professional finish. By following these steps, you will have successfully hidden the screw heads while making a worm bin for apartments."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the answer?","output":"In heraldry, a bar sinister – also known as bend sinister – is a broad diagonal stripe that runs from the top right to the bottom left on a shield. Traditionally, it is said to signify illegitimacy or bastardy in the family lineage of the bearer. However, the true meaning and use of the bend sinister are often misunderstood. Firstly, it is crucial to understand that a heraldic shield, also called an escutcheon, is a representation of a noble person's lineage and family connections. The symbols, colors, and designs used on a shield were meant to tell a unique and identifiable story about the owner and their ancestry. In heraldry, each design element is named and used to signify specific characteristics, qualities, or values of the person who bears the coat of arms. The bend sinister is a broad diagonal band that slants from the top right corner (dexter upper corner) to the bottom left corner (sinister lower corner) of a shield. Contrary to popular belief, the bend sinister does not necessarily signify illegitimacy on its own. In some cases, it may have been used to imply such unofficial connections, but it was never a steadfast rule in the heraldic tradition. The bend sinister had its meanings and variations too. One common misconception is that the bend sinister signifies a stain on the family's honor, owing to a family member's illegitimate birth. However, this interpretation has been mostly discredited by heraldic experts. Historically, it is believed that the bend sinister may have been used to indicate the left-handedness of the bearer, or simply to differentiate between different branches of a family, without implying any negative connotation to the bearer's lineage. Another variant of the bend sinister is the baton sinister – a thinner diagonal stripe running from top right to bottom left, which was used to signify illegitimacy more explicitly. This narrower diagonally drawn line, different from the broad bar sinister, had a more specific meaning and was placed on a shield to clearly mark someone as coming from an illegitimate line. In conclusion, although the bar sinister, or bend sinister, is traditionally attached to the idea of illegitimacy, the concept of its use as a symbol of bastardy is more a romanticized notion than a strict heraldic tradition. The bend sinister might have indeed been used to differentiate or imply a certain connection at times, but it was never a steadfast rule in the practice of heraldry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then, you need to write down your business' name, how people can talk to you, and where you get your bills.  Next, you need to tell them what kind of store yours is - is it a sports store, a big shop with lots of different things, or a shoe shop?

Then, you must tell them about the boss of the store - their name, what job they do, and some more info.

He also voiced concern that political considerations are driving U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to compromise joint security for more false denuclearization promises from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I am rather pessimistic about whether this negotiation will work out well or not. The only means for North Korea to maintain its regime is its nuclear program. The moment that North Korea gives up its nuclear program, and the moment it opens up to reform, the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse,” said Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party. On June 12, Trump and Kim will meet in Singapore to try to reach an agreement to end the North’s threatening nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees that could include a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that has been enforced since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Many South Korean conservatives had voiced strong support for Trump’s “maximum pressure” polices to force Pyongyang to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons through tough international sanctions in place that ban 90 percent of the country’s trade, and the threat of military action. But they have been troubled by recent statements coming from the Trump administration indicating the United States may be willing to soften its demands for the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North’s nuclear program before offering any sanctions relief. Hong is worried that Trump may seek a deal that would quickly end the North’s intercontinental ballistic missile program that directly threatens the U.S., and leave the regional nuclear threat to be resolved later. Trump seems overly intent to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, Hong said, to shift the media focus away from the ongoing special prosecutor investigation he is facing over Russia’s...

With Detroit's declaration on Thursday of bankruptcy, some of the city's creditors may think so. The museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts, home to 60,000 pieces of art, is also home to the original Howdy Doody marionette puppet that was the star of its own 1950s-era children's show. It was acquired in 2001, according to the DIA's director of communications. \\"It is estimated that the marionette could sell at auction for 400,000 to 500,000,\\" said Gary Busk, a puppet collector who was featured on the television program \\"Antiques Road Show.\\" That would hardly make a dent in the city's immense 18 billion debt. But, despite an opinion from the state's attorney general that appeared to assure Howdy would stay, legal experts say there's still a risk he could wind up packing his bags and riding into the sunset with many of the museum's other residents. The arts institute's director, Graham Beal, maintains that DIA's collection is among the top six in the Western Hemisphere. While he could not specify a value, Beal told CNN in May that it would likely be in the billions of dollars. It was then that that a request by Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, for an inventory of holdings sparked alarm among Detroit residents and museum administrators that the DIA's collection could be sold to help pay off the city's debt. Then, in June, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette issued an opinion stating that Detroit can't sell the DIA's art, although the city technically owns the collection. \\"It is my opinion, therefore, that the art collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts is held by the City of Detroit in charitable trust for the people of Michigan, and no piece in the collection may thus be sold, conveyed, or transferred to satisfy city debts or obligations,\\" Schuette told CNN in a written statement. He said that he recognized the extreme financial hardships the city is experiencing, and the challenges the city faces, but argued that selling the artwork would \\"damage not only the city's but the state's cultural commonwealth.\\" But the opinion could be for naught, said Eric Scorsone of Michigan State University prior to Thursday's declaration. \\"It's certainly better than nothing, but a state attorney general's opinion is certainly not going to be definitive in federal bankruptcy court,\\" Scorsone said. \\"I don't think that is going to carry a huge amount of weight.\\" Laura Martell, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, echoed that sentiment. \\"He just issued an opinion, which is not binding on anyone and certainly has no legal effect in a bankruptcy case,\\" she said. \\"A bankruptcy judge may or may not find it persuasive on the merits of its analysis, but it has no binding effect.\\" Bill Nowling, spokesman for emergency manager Orr, said that \\"nothing is being considered for sale.\\" \\"All of the city's creditors have asked about the DIA and whether it has been valued -- it has not -- and some creditors have said everything that isn't nailed down should be sold to pay them,\\" Nowling wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \\"That won't happen because the emergency manager's proposed restructuring plan is focused on restoring essential city services.\\" However, Detroit's creditors say promises were made and debts must be paid. \\"If they're talking about not being solvent when they have these assets, they do still have some degree of solvency by selling these assets,\\" said Peter Hayes, a managing director at BlackRock Inc., an investment management corporation whose investors are owed approximately 200 million by the city of Detroit. Even as signs of the coming bankruptcy grew stronger, the DIA's officials remained resolute in their determination to protect their collection. \\"Our position hasn't changed. We only sell works of art to buy works of art,\\" Beal said. \\"We are not given works of art so that we can settle debts made (during) decades of mismanagement and corruption.\\" Howdy Doody is a marionette in the image of a freckled-face boy dressed in cowboy attire. \\"The Howdy Doody Show\\" ran on NBC from 1947 to 1960. One of Muppet creator Jim Henson's Kermit the Frog puppets is also among the DIA's puppet collection, which boasts around 800 pieces. The DIA was founded in 1885 and houses more than 100 galleries, a lecture and recital hall, an art reference library, and a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory, according to the museum's website. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"Detroit's budget is in big trouble, and they owe a lot of money. Some people think that selling special things from the Detroit Institute of Arts, like a famous puppet named Howdy Doody, could help pay off some of the debt. But, selling one puppet wouldn't make enough money to fix the problem. Some people worry that the museum's whole art collection could be sold, but the boss of the museum said they won't sell their art to pay for the city's problems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(AP Photo/Andres Kudacki) (Associated Press)      Fire damage is seen on a side of Trump Tower in New York, Saturday, April 7, 2018. The Fire Department says the blaze broke out on the 50th floor shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday. (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki) (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — A raging fire that tore through a 50th-floor apartment at Trump Tower killed a man inside and sent flames and thick, black smoke pouring from windows of the president's namesake skyscraper.      New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said the cause of Saturday's blaze is not yet known but the apartment was \\"virtually entirely on fire\\" when firefighters arrived after 5:30 p.m.      \\"It was a very difficult fire, as you can imagine,\\" Nigro told reporters outside the building in midtown Manhattan. \\"The apartment is quite large.\\"      Todd Brassner, 67, who was in the apartment, was taken to a hospital and died a short time later, the New York Police Department said. Property records obtained by The Associated Press indicate Brassner was an art dealer who had purchased his 50th-floor unit in 1996.      Officials said four firefighters also suffered minor injuries. An investigation is ongoing.      Shortly after news of the fire broke, Trump, who was in Washington, tweeted: \\"Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!\\"      Asked if that assessment was accurate, Nigro said, \\"It's a well-built building. The upper floors, the residence floors, are not sprinklered.\\"      Fire sprinklers were not required in New York City high-rises when Trump Tower was completed in 1983. Subsequent updates to the building code required commercial skyscrapers to install the sprinklers retroactively, but owners of older residential high-rises are not required to install sprinklers unless the building undergoes major renovations.      Some fire-safety advocates pushed for a requirement that older apartment buildings be retrofitted with sprinklers when New York City passed a law requiring them in new residential highrises in 1999, but officials in the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani said that would be too expensive.      Nigro noted that no member of the Trump family was in the 664-foot tower Saturday.      Trump's family has an apartment on the top floors of the 58-story building, but he has spent little time in New York since taking office. The headquarters of the Trump Organization is on the 26th floor.      Nigro said firefighters and Secret Service members checked on the condition of Trump's apartment. About 200 firefighters and emergency medical service workers responded to the fire, he said.      Some residents said they didn't get any notification from building management to evacuate.      Lalitha Masson, a 76-year-old resident, called it \\"a very, very terrifying experience.\\"      Masson told The New York Times that she did not receive any announcement about leaving, and that when she called the front desk no one answered.      \\"When I saw the television, I thought we were finished,\\" said Masson, who lives on the 36th floor with her husband, Narinder, who is 79 and has Parkinson's disease.      She said she started praying because she felt it was the end.      \\"I called my oldest son and said goodbye to him because the way it looked everything was falling out of the window, and it reminded me of 9/11,\\" Masson said. ||||| New York (CNN) A fire broke out at Trump Tower on Saturday, leaving one man dead and six firefighters injured, the New York City Fire Department said.      Police identified the man killed as Todd Brassner, 67, a resident of the building's 50th floor. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition but later died, said spokeswoman Angelica Conroy of the Fire Department.      Brassner was unconscious and unresponsive when firefighters pulled him out, the New York Police Department said. The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death.      The fire was contained to the 50th floor of the tower, located on Fifth Avenue in New York.

Background: Jon Steven Young (born October 11, 1961) is a former professional American football quarterback who played 15 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and is best known for his 13 seasons with the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for the NFL Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League (USFL). Young played college football for Brigham Young University, setting school and NCAA records en route to being runner-up for the 1983 Heisman Trophy. Young was named the AP's NFL Most Valuable Player in 1992 and 1994, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXIX. Context: By the start of the 1992 season, it appeared that Young's starting job was in serious peril. In addition to having to compete with Bono, Montana appeared to be close to recovering from his elbow tendon surgery. San Francisco came close to trading Young to the Los Angeles Raiders, but no deal was finalized and it turned out that Montana would not recover in time to start in the opening game. Montana would not return until the final game of the 1992 season, a Monday Night home game against the Detroit Lions. Montana played the entire second half and guided the 49ers to victory.  Young ended up as San Francisco's starting quarterback, but once again got off to a rough start. On the fifth play of the opening game at the Giants, he suffered a concussion and was replaced by Bono, who threw two touchdown passes while leading the 49ers to a 31-14 win. The following week, San Francisco lost 34-31 to the Buffalo Bills, despite a career-high 449 passing yards and three touchdowns from Young, in a game that for the first time in NFL history there were zero punts from either team.  Young recovered and led the 49ers on a five-game winning streak, capped off by a 56-17 win over the Atlanta Falcons in which Young passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns. After missing most of the next game (a 24-14 loss to the Cardinals) with the flu, he led San Francisco to victory in all of their remaining games of the season, giving the team a 14-2 record. He went on to throw for 227 yards and 2 touchdowns, and rush for 73 yards, in a 20-13 divisional playoff win over the Washington Redskins. The 49ers lost the NFC title game, however, 30-20 against the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. Young threw for 313 yards, completing 71.4% of his passes while passing for one touchdown and rushing for another. He also threw two interceptions, but the final one came with the outcome of the game already decided.  Young finished the season with 3,465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards, along with an NFL best 25 touchdown passes and 107.0 passer rating, earning him the NFL Most Valuable Player Award and his first selection to the Pro Bowl. He was the first quarterback ever to record a triple digit rating in consecutive seasons. Many credit Young's turnaround to the mentoring of the 49ers' new Offensive Coordinator Mike Shanahan, who worked with Young on combining his running skill with on-the-move passing decisions. Question: What did he do? Answer:","output":"In the 1992 NFL season, Steve Young faced several challenges, including the possibility of losing his starting position due to the potential return of Joe Montana and competition with Steve Bono. However, Montana's recovery took longer than expected, and Young remained the starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. Despite suffering a concussion in the first game and losing the following week's game, Young displayed his resilience, leading the team on a five-game winning streak. He then led the 49ers to victories in all remaining games, achieving a 14-2 season record. Under the guidance of new Offensive Coordinator Mike Shanahan, Young focused on combining his running skills with on-the-move passing decisions. Throughout the season, Young threw for 3,465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards, scoring an NFL best of 25 touchdown passes and achieving a 107.0 passer rating. As a result, he became the first quarterback to record a triple-digit rating in consecutive seasons. For his remarkable performance, Young was awarded the NFL Most Valuable Player and earned his first selection to the Pro Bowl. Although the 49ers lost the NFC title game against the Dallas Cowboys, Young concluded an impressive season which solidified his status as one of the NFL's top quarterbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This strategic move comes at a crucial time when the sports broadcasting giant needs to reestablish its dominance amidst the rising competition. Body: The popular reporter, known for their in-depth analysis and engaging reporting style, left ESPN last year citing personal reasons. Their departure came amidst a wave of high-profile exits that raised concerns about the network's ability to retain top-tier talent. During their time away from ESPN, the reporter gained significant attention and praise for their work with other media outlets. Their return is seen as a major win for ESPN, as some fans and insiders attribute the decline in viewership to the network's inability to hold onto its most beloved reporting assets. Over the past year, ESPN has witnessed several top talents leaving due to a variety of reasons, such as contract disputes and better opportunities elsewhere. These departures led to criticisms about the company's management, citing a lack of strategic direction and adaptability to the changing media landscape. In response to these challenges, ESPN has made significant changes to its structure, including investment in digital platforms and rebuilding relationships with key on-air personalities. The return of the popular reporter marks a new chapter for the network and demonstrates the organization's commitment to providing unparalleled sports coverage to fans around the world. Conclusion: The return of the popular reporter to ESPN signals a promising step forward for the beleaguered network, which has faced extensive scrutiny due to its recent spate of departures. As ESPN looks to reestablish its dominance in the sports broadcasting arena, the restored faith in its ability to retain top talent bodes well for the company's future prospects. Fans and industry insiders alike eagerly await the reporter's triumphant return to the airwaves, confident in ESPN's dedication to maintaining its status as a premier source for sports news and analysis.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Matthew is training to run a marathon. Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running?  Hint: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","output":"The breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. During physical activities like running, your muscles are working harder and require more energy than in a state of rest or less strenuous activities. This additional energy is obtained through the process of cellular respiration, during which glucose is converted into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - the direct source of energy for the cells. This process needs oxygen to occur - hence, the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. In cases like Matthew's, where he is training to run a marathon, his body has to go through consistent and intense bouts of exercise. As he runs up and down the hill, his muscles are working overtime and need more ATP, and therefore more oxygen. To meet this increased oxygen demand, his body automatically increases his breathing rate. This is why Matthew finds himself out of breath after his uphill-downhill runs.  An increased rate of breathing ensures that more oxygen is taken in with each breath, and more carbon dioxide, a waste product of respiration, is expelled out of the body. This increase in oxygen intake helps to fuel the ongoing cellular respiration and energy production, and therefore helps Matthew to continue his runs. As his breathing rate increases, he's able to continue to fulfill the higher energy requirement of his exercising muscles. Conversely, when Matthew walks around his house and his physical activity level decreases, his muscles don't need as much ATP or oxygen. As a result, his breathing rate decreases to its normal level as his muscle cells return to their baseline metabolic rates. In biological terms, Matthew's increased respiration rate during running isn't just a simple gas exchange with the environment. It showcases the complex interplay between the physical environment and his cellular environment, driven by the chemistry of his body needing oxygen to create energy, and how that correlates with his body's energy usage during physical exertion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 60-year-old woman was taken by ambulance to Southland Hospital after firefighters battled for 30 minutes to cut her from her car. Acting Senior Sergeant Brock Davis of Invercargill, said emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at the crossroads of Motorimu Rd and State Highway I shortly before 5:00 p.m. yesterday. Mr. Davis said a Mitsubishi car driven by a 30-year-old man traveling north on the highway and the woman's southbound   Suzuki Alto collided  . The man suffered slight injuries in the crash, he said. Invercargill Passenger Transport Ltd driver Bill McDermott and his passengers--New Zealand Aluminum Smelters Ltd workers were first on the scene and alerted emergency services.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the album \\"Autumn Almanac\\" was on?  The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October.

He needs to determine the properties of each state.  In which state the distance between particles are smaller, state B or state C? Answer:","output":"In state B, which is the liquid state, the distance between particles is smaller. In the different states of matter, the arrangement of particles varies: 1. Solid state (state A) - In the solid state, particles are closely packed together in an orderly and fixed arrangement, having a strong intermolecular bond. Typically, solids have a defined shape and volume. 2. Liquid state (state B) - In the liquid state, particles are still relatively close to each other but have slightly more freedom to move compared to the solid state. The intermolecular forces are weaker in a liquid, allowing them to flow and take the shape of the container. Liquids have a defined volume but not a fixed shape. 3. Gaseous state (state C) - In the gaseous state, particles are widely spaced, having the weakest intermolecular forces, which results in them being free to move in any direction. Gases do not have a defined shape or volume and can expand to fill any container they are in.

Summarize: Oaks, which all fall under the genus (Quercus) are wide-spread trees found in temperate climates the world over. There are over 600 known species of Oak, with 55 found in the continental United States. Because there is such a wide variety of oak trees in the world, it can be hard to find characteristics that unite them all. However, they do exist:   Acorns are the easiest way to spot an oak tree. If the tree produces acorns, it's an oak.  Lobed leaves are leaves that have rounded or pointed knobs extending out from the center line. While a few oaks do not have lobes, all of the leaves are generally symmetrical around a clear median line.  Small, scaly bark. Bark on oak trees is variable, but it is generally made up of small, hard, and scaly bits of bark. This is unlike the large, flaky chunks of pines or the wallpaper-like bark on birch trees, and is much more cracked and grooved. Lobes are the bits of leaf that extend out to each side from the center of the leaf, like points on a star. White oaks have rounded lobes while red oaks have pointed ones. This is an important distinction that will cut the number of potential trees you're trying to identify in half. On red oaks, the vein of the leave extends all the way out to the edge, creating this point. Each area has its own assortment of oak species, which is often drastically different from other areas. The species of oak you will encounter changes great depending on where you are in the world, as it is rare for an oak found on the east coast to be found in the west, a southern oak in the north, etc. You can generally figure out your region with a few criteria (examples here are for Continental US):  General location -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, Southwest Inland or coastal. Mountainous or flat terrain. The lobes are the sections that extend out from the center of the leaf's stem on both sides. If possible, compare multiple leaves to find the average number of lobes. A few species such as the willow oak have no lobes at all, but most oaks have multiple lobes. Count at least 4-5 leaves when identifying, as this will help when you turn to the field guide. Look at the area between the lobes and determine whether the indentations are deep or shallow. White oak leaves often have variable indentations that alternate randomly between shallow and deep, where red oaks can have dramatic, sharp indentations or none at all. The leaves of evergreen oaks are shiny and dark green all year, but most oaks will turn colors in autumn. Some oaks, such as scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), sport brilliant colors in the fall. White oaks and chestnut oaks are often a dull brown when color comes around. If it's summer, look at whether the leaves are dark green or light green, and whether they're shiny or not, to help determine the species. Evergreen oaks and a couple red oaks such as scrub oak have smaller leaves while most red oaks and nearly all deciduous white oaks have much larger leaves (at least 4 in.). This is one of the more important distinguishing features between similar species of oak. Using the data you've collected, identify your oak tree using a tree manual or field guide. There are dozens and dozens of oak trees out there, and you can't he expected to know them all by heart. Use the above criteria to narrow down your choices, then use the guide to find what oak you're looking at. You can look through the collection of common oak trees below, or consult a Field Guide, found through the US Forestry Service.  Turn to the appropriate section. Most guides are divided into a red oak section and a white oak section Narrow your selection down to the oaks specific to your area. A good guide should have distribution maps for each species. Once you have a list of possibilities, look at the pictures for each one to determine your tree.","output":"Oak trees are special trees that grow in many different places around the world. There are over 600 types of oak trees! One way to know if a tree is an oak tree is by looking at its acorns. All oak trees make acorns.

Answer this question: with what movie did humphrey bogart win his only oscar??","output":"Humphrey Bogart won his one and only Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film \\"The African Queen\\" (1951), directed by John Huston. This film is an adaptation of the 1935 novel of the same name by C. S. Forester and features a screenplay co-written by John Huston and James Agee. The African Queen is an adventure, war, and romance drama set in Africa during World War I. The film stars Humphrey Bogart as Charlie Allnut, a Canadian boat captain, and Katharine Hepburn as Rose Sayer, the sister of a British missionary. The story follows the unlikely partnership between these two characters, who are forced to work together after German troops destroy the mission where Rose and her brother lived. When Rose Sayer's brother dies from the shock and trauma of the attack, Charlie takes her aboard his small, dilapidated boat named \\"The African Queen.\\" Despite their differences - Rose being a prim and highly moral British woman, and Charlie being a rough-and-tumble boat captain - they set out on a perilous journey down the Ulanga River, planning to torpedo a German gunboat in order to avenge Rose's brother and the civilians attacked by the Germans. Throughout their journey, they face various obstacles such as dangerous rapids, swamps, malaria, leeches, and the constant threat of being captured by the Germans. As they overcome these challenges, they develop a mutual respect and love for each other. Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Charlie Allnut was widely acclaimed and earned him his only Oscar, solidifying his status as one of Hollywood's greatest actors. Bogart's ability to capture the character's gradual transformation from a disheveled and unkempt boat captain to a determined and courageous hero resonated with audiences and remains a memorable performance in the history of cinema. In addition to Bogart's award-winning performance, \\"The African Queen\\" is notable for its groundbreaking on-location filming in Africa, specifically in the Belgian Congo and Uganda. This decision by director John Huston added an authenticity to the film's setting and challenged the conventional Hollywood practice of filming exclusively on studio sets and back lots. The African Queen has stood the test of time as a classic in the world of cinema, and Humphrey Bogart's incredible performance in the film remains a significant achievement in his illustrious career."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D.

The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media.

Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- After the Republicans and Democrats met at the White House summit on health care, it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement. Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal. The White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation.","output":"It seems the most logical way to complete this passage is to summarize the situation as it stands, make a hypothesis on possible outcomes, and indicate what next steps could be from both parties involved. So, here's how it could be completed: If the Democrats proceed with this approach, it will likely result in a high degree of controversy with the potential for political fallout. This could be exacerbated if the Republicans decide to retaliate by employing procedural tactics to delay the Democrats' initiatives. However, the potential benefits for the health care system and millions of Americans, whom the Democrats argue would benefit from this reform, may outweigh such risks from their perspective. The idea is that the Democrats seem to face a dilemma between striving for bipartisan cooperation and acting unilaterally to achieve their stated policy objectives despite potential backlash. The upcoming days will undoubtedly hold intense debate and complex negotiations, after which the final decision will be shaped. Ultimately, the direction of health care reform in the United States will depend entirely on the strategic choices made by both Democrats and Republicans in this contentious policy-making environment. In the meantime, all eyes will be firmly focused on Washington as this significant legislative moment plays out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe is an international initiative aimed at addressing the crises that emerged in the Western Balkan states, particularly in the aftermath of the collapse of the former Yugoslavia. The conflicts and tensions that plagued the region during the 1990s had led to civil war, ethnic tensions, and humanitarian crises. Consequently, the international community, including the European Union (EU), the United States, and other international actors, came together to create the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe in order to promote peace, stability, and regional cooperation. The main goal of the Stability Pact was to establish a stable, secure, and prosperous region through political and economic collaboration among countries in the region, along with the support of the international community. The pact aimed to achieve this objective by fostering good neighborly relations, respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all participating states, and adhering to a set of shared principles and values, such as the rule of law, human rights, and democracy. Several crucial components contributed to the implementation of the Stability Pact. Among them were the promotion of security and stability in the region, the facilitation of economic cooperation and development, and the encouragement of deeper integration with European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Additionally, the international community provided substantial financial and technical assistance to help participating countries overcome existing challenges and build resilient societies, capable of sustaining peace and prosperity. Over the years, the Stability Pact has witnessed some significant achievements. For instance, numerous bilateral agreements among participating countries have contributed to improved relations, and collaboration on various regional initiatives has solidified partnerships. Furthermore, several countries in the region have managed to join the European Union or are actively pursuing that goal as part of their engagement with the Stability Pact. In conclusion, the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe is a critical instrument created to address the challenges that the Western Balkan countries, particularly those that were part of the former Yugoslavia, have been facing in the post-conflict era. By promoting regional stability, security, and economic cooperation, the Stability Pact has made significant strides in helping to build a brighter future for the people in this region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As only Jobs could do, he captivated the audience as he tapped and swiped between screens, watched a YouTube video, and browsed the iTunes store. It was clear from what Jobs had shown critics that day that the iPad created a new class of consumer-friendly tablets, but even though users spent hundreds of dollars on the device many were unhappy with its multitasking features. With the release of iOS 9, Apple AAPL is turning the page on the iPad’s story by adding powerful new features and a redesigned on-screen keyboard to the device. After testing out Apple’s new operating system it’s clear there’s still more work that needs to be done, but definitely worth the upgrade. One of the most obvious changes is a new feature called Slide Over, which allows you to temporarily slide between two apps at one time. In order to access the Slide Over tool users simply have to open slide their finger over to the right edge of the iPad’s screen where a narrow column will appear. Tap on the desired app and it will appear atop the app you’re currently in. I often used slide over to quickly view my schedule, found in the calendar app, and send meeting requests while using Mail. Taking the concept of slide over one-step further is another new feature called Split View. For the first time iPad users will have the ability to run two apps on screen at the same time. Unlike slide over, users can interact with both apps simultaneously, and also adjust the amount of screen real estate each one takes up. The Split view feature was displayed onstage at Apple’s Sept. 9 event to demonstrate how users can work with both Word and Excel document concurrently, sharing content between the two applications. I used it on numerous occasions to conduct research in Safari while writing a story in the Notes app. I wasn’t forced to bounce between apps; I could gather the necessary facts and incorporate them with ease. Unfortunately, sharing content between the two apps isn’t easy and has to be done through copy and paste. Adding a drag-and-drop method, where users could add photos to a Word document from another app, or attaching a PowerPoint presentation to an email seems like a natural fit, alleviating unnecessary steps in the process. Additionally, as more apps are updated and released for iOS 9, in turn, polluting the column of apps you can choose from, the feature will become harder to use. Right now, iOS 9 lacks a method for removing apps or reorganizing the order in which apps are displayed, which is a frustrating omission. A new powerful picture-in-picture feature makes it possible to continue watching videos or conducting FaceTime video calls. Users can, for example, watch a movie while browsing Facebook or Twitter. The video player is adjustable in size and can be placed in any corner of the screen. Slide over and picture-in-picture will work on the iPad Pro, both iPad Air models, as well as the iPad Mini 2 and newer devices. Split-view is limited to the iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4, and the iPad Pro. Apple also updated the iPad’s virtual keyboard, adding trackpad-like functionality to the device. As you enter text, you can place two fingers on the keyboard in order to activate the new feature. When active, you drag your fingers across the keyboard to move the cursor. A quick double-tap of two fingers on the screen will highlight the nearest word, and continue highlighting until you lift your fingers off the screen. Editing big blocks of text used to be a laborious process, requiring multiple taps, but the new trackpad functionality simplifies this process. At present, my only complaint is that it’s not available across the company’s entire iPhone lineup; only the iPhone 6s will have it thanks to 3D Touch. There’s still a lot of work to be done, but overall, the iPad’s new operating system is a step in the right direction. It makes sense for iOS 9 to introduce the new features now, rather than wait for the iPad Pro to become available. Users can put the iPad’s multitasking prowess to the test over the next two months. Armed with knowledge gained from the experience, consumers can then decide if an iPad Pro is worth purchasing. The iPad is finally growing up—both in size, and feature set. As someone who had already incorporated the iPad, before iOS 9 existed, into my daily work routine, I’m excited to see what the future holds.

To do this, we will move the constant term to the other side by subtracting 112 from both sides. 28x = -112 Step 3: Finally, to get the value of x, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 28 in this case.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near.

If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Canada, the second largest country in the world, lies in the north of America. The population of Canada is about 29 million and the capital is Ottawa. The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas   as well. There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial  language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit  , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all. The government has started a new school project in which Inuit teach their own young children. So it is hoped that the way of Inuit life will be kept alive for more centuries.

Answer the following question: This article: The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk, which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country. Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of Cyril of Turaw.By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk. After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of \\"Belarusianization\\" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s.The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil Bykaŭ and Uladzimir Karatkievich.

Process:  - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the location is quiet happens, how will it affect the bat has a lower perception of the sound waves.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation does have an effect on the process of echolocation used by bats and other animals. In quiet or low-noise environments, the efficiency of echolocation can be affected in both positive and negative ways. Let's examine these effects in detail. Positive Effects: 1. Improved signal-to-noise ratio: In a quiet environment, bats can produce high-pitched sounds that encounter relatively little interference from background noise. The reduced noise allows the bat to perceive the reflected sound waves with greater precision, making it easier for the animal to determine the distance, size, and shape of the objects in its vicinity. 2. Enhanced detection range: When the environment is quiet, the sound waves produced by the bat can travel farther without losing strength. As a result, bats can detect objects at a greater distance, giving them a larger operational range. 3. Greater accuracy: In the absence of background noise, bats can more accurately pinpoint the location of objects in their environment. This increased accuracy is crucial for tasks such as hunting prey, navigating, and avoiding obstacles.  Negative Effects: 1. Reduced sensitivity: In quiet environments, bats may lower the intensity of their call to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Consequently, the reflected sound waves will also have a lower intensity, making it harder for the bat to accurately perceive the environment. This might lead to a reduction in their overall ability to locate and track objects. 2. Increased vulnerability: Bats and other animals that rely on echolocation may be more vulnerable to predation in quiet environments. As echolocation calls are more distinct against a quiet background, potential predators may be better equipped to locate and target bats. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that quiet environments can have both positive and negative impacts on the echolocation capabilities of bats and other animals. A quiet environment can enhance the sensitivity and range of echolocation, as well as improve the accuracy of detecting objects. However, it may also lead to reduced sensitivity and an increased vulnerability to predation. Ultimately, the ability of bats to adapt and adjust their echolocation calls in response to changing environmental conditions plays a significant role in the effectiveness of their echolocation process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain. A:","output":"Based on the context provided, the main rival of France on the imperial stage became Britain. While England and the Netherlands entered the Nine Years' War as allies, the conflict eventually left the English as a stronger colonial power than the Dutch. From the early 18th century, Britain emerged as the world's dominant colonial force, with France becoming its most significant competitor in imperial affairs. The rivalry between Britain and France intensified following the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession. Charles II's bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, the French king's grandson, threatened the prospect of France, Spain, and their colonies uniting, a situation deemed unacceptable by England and other European powers. In response, England, Portugal, and the Netherlands allied with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France. The War of the Spanish Succession lasted from 1701 to 1714 and concluded with the Treaty of Utrecht, which greatly impacted the balance of power among European nations and colonies. Philippe of Anjou renounced his claim to the French throne, and Spain lost its empire in Europe. Britain emerged from the war with an expanded empire, gaining territories such as Newfoundland and Acadia from France, and Gibraltar and Menorca from Spain.  The acquisition of Gibraltar provided Britain with a pivotal naval base that allowed it to control key points in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, bolstering its position as a global power in the centuries to come. Furthermore, Spain ceded the lucrative asiento, or the permission to sell slaves in Spanish America, to Britain, granting it a significant economic advantage in the region. With these territorial and economic gains, Britain continued to assert and expand its influence worldwide, often at the expense of its chief rival, France. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the two powers were frequently in conflict, either directly or through proxies, as they sought to maintain and extend their colonial possessions. As a result, Britain's emergence as a dominant colonial power and its steady rise through imperial competition effectively established it as France's main rival on the stage of empire-building and global influence."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Please answer a question about the following article about Nanjing: It is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming Empire until 1421, when the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, the Yongle Emperor, relocated the capital to Beijing. When did Nanjing cease to be the capital?","output":"Nanjing ceased to be the capital of the Ming Empire in 1421 when the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, the Yongle Emperor, decided to relocate the capital to Beijing. This decision marked a significant change in the political and historical landscape of China. Nanjing, also known as the Southern Capital, held significant importance for the Ming Empire. As the largest city in the world between 1358 and 1425, it boasted a population of 487,000 in the year 1400. The city's prominence during this time period not only reflected its status as an influential political center but also its importance as a cultural, economic, and technological hub. The Yongle Emperor's decision to shift the capital to Beijing can be attributed to several reasons. First and foremost, Beijing's strategic location in the north allowed for better defense against potential threats, such as the Mongols. This geographical advantage was particularly important, given the Ming dynasty's historical conflicts with the Mongols. In addition, the shift to Beijing was also aimed at consolidating the emperor's power and authority. The Yongle Emperor was a powerful and ambitious ruler who sought to strengthen the central government and expand his empire. Establishing a new capital in Beijing enabled him to assert greater control over the vast territory of China and project his influence over neighboring regions. Despite Nanjing's ceasing to be the capital in 1421, the city continued to play a significant role in Chinese history. Notably, it served as the capital of the Republic of China under the Kuomintang government from 1928 to 1949. Today, Nanjing remains an important political, cultural, and economic center in China, with its rich history and contributions to Chinese civilization leaving an indelible mark on the country's development and progress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To answer the question of which factors need to be present for a tectonic plate movement, first, we need to understand the process. Tectonic plates move due to the convection currents generated by the heat released from the Earth's mantle. Plates are made of solid rock but sit above a layer of partially melted rock, or magma, from the mantle (the layer between the Earth's crust and core). As this partially molten material moves, it drags the plates along with it, causing them to move. (A) A pool of molten lava: A pool of molten rock, or magma, is formed when mantle material melts due to the heat and pressure. This molten material rises towards the surface and can be found beneath tectonic plates, where it contributes to plate movement. Therefore, the presence of molten lava is essential in the process of tectonic plate movement. (D) A crack in the core: Although it is not directly related to the process of tectonic plate movement, cracks in the core (fault lines) can indirectly affect tectonic plate movement. A fault line is a planar fracture in the Earth's surface along which there has been significant displacement as a result of rock-mass movement. Since tectonic plates move along fault lines, the presence of a crack in the core can be considered an essential factor for plate movement. The other options are not essential for tectonic plate movement: (B) An ocean with fish: The presence of an ocean with fish has no direct or indirect influence on tectonic plate movement. Plate movement occurs due to the convection currents generated by the Earth's mantle, and not because of the presence of water or aquatic life. (C) A river flowing north: The direction of a river's flow has no effect on tectonic plate movement. River formation and direction are typically a result of geology, climate, and other factors, but they do not influence the processes that drive plate movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In his speech held on the occasion of the event, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias affirmed that authorities remain committed to finding a path towards the reunification of the divided island. Cyprus has been divided since 1974, with the northern part being occupied by Turkish forces and declared as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, while the southern part is the Republic of Cyprus, an EU member state. The division has caused considerable political, economic, and social challenges for both sides of the island, and efforts to resolve the situation have been ongoing for decades. Numerous rounds of negotiations and peace talks have been held under the auspices of the United Nations, but a long-lasting and mutually acceptable resolution has not yet been reached. Several key issues need to be addressed in order to achieve the reunification of Cyprus. These include the return of displaced persons, the issue of property rights of individuals affected by the division, security arrangements and the presence of foreign troops, governance structures in a reunited federal state, and the management of natural resources. In his speech, President Christofias emphasized the importance of reunification efforts, calling for a spirit of cooperation, compromise, and mutual respect among all parties involved. He also highlighted the need for sustained and creative diplomacy, taking into account the concerns and aspirations of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, as well as regional and international stakeholders. Some of the potential benefits of reunification would be the enhancement of regional security and stability, improved economic development and prosperity for all Cypriots, as well as strengthened cooperation and integration with European and international partners. The complex task of reunification will also require support for trust-building measures, the promotion of inter-communal ties and dialogues, and the implementation of confidence-building initiatives. In conclusion, President Christofias's speech aimed to underscore the commitment of the Cypriot authorities to work towards the reunification of the divided island. Such efforts will require patience, determination, and continued engagement from all parties in order to reach a comprehensive, sustainable, and fair solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: By. Chris Kitching for MailOnline. Air India’s woes with rodent stowaways appear to be continuing after a rat was reportedly spotted on board a plane in the country’s capital. The plane was taken out of service and fumigated after it landed at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport from the city of Ranchi yesterday, the Times of India reported. It is at least the fourth reported sighting on an Air India aircraft this year. Scroll down for video. Rats on a plane: There have been at least four rodent sightings on Air India flights this year. Earlier this month, cabin crew spotted rats scurrying free in the rear half of a plane as it landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport from Calcutta. The Airbus A321 was carrying about 200 passengers and staff, and it was removed from service and taken to a remote airport bay to be fumigated. In May, the pilot on a flight from New Delhi to London reported a rat in the cockpit, the newspaper reported. But there are conflicting reports about whether a rat was actually on board. Rats were blamed after a domestic flight from Mumbai suffered a two-hour delay in February. Planes must be fumigated even when there is an unconfirmed sighting because the rodents pose a serious threat to the safety of passengers and crew. An Air India aircraft that flew from Ranchi to New Delhi had to be fumigated after a rat was reported on board. Rats can chew on electrical wires and disrupt computer systems aboard an aircraft. The rodents normally sneak onto aircraft via catering vehicles loaded with food. Last year, health inspectors in China found nearly a dozen rats underneath a business class seat after a commercial flight landed at Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport from Hong Kong. Inspectors wearing protective suits and masks boarded the plane and searched through overhead storage bins and behind seats. In 2009, an Air India flight from Amritsar to Toronto was delayed for nearly half a day as staff tried to catch a rat that was spotted on board. The flight was delayed while a replacement aircraft was flown in. Highlights:","output":"Air India keeps facing problems with rats sneaking onto their planes.

Born on October 27, 1969, in Athens, Georgia, Kasay had an impressive career in NFL that spanned almost two decades. Throughout his career, Kasay played for several teams, including the Carolina Panthers, the New Orleans Saints, and the Seattle Seahawks. When reflecting on Kasay's achievements, one aspect of interest is the difference in yardage between his longest and second longest field goals. In this article, we will delve into Kasay's career and explore the yardage difference between these two remarkable field goals. Step 1: Research John Kasay's Career and Field Goal Statistics  To answer the question of how many yards longer John Kasay's longest field goal was compared to his second longest, we would first need to gather accurate information on his field goal records. We can start by researching credible sources such as the NFL's official website, sports-related databases, and notable sports news sources. Step 2: Identify John Kasay's Longest and Second Longest Field Goals After gathering reliable information on John Kasay's field goal records, we can identify both his longest and second longest field goals. To ensure accuracy, it's necessary to cross-reference the information with multiple sources. Step 3: Calculate the Yardage Difference  Once we have the yardages for John Kasay's longest and second longest field goals, we can determine the difference by simply subtracting the yardage of his second longest field goal from that of his longest field goal. This will provide us with the yardage difference between the two field goals. Analysis: Upon researching John Kasay's career statistics, we found that his longest field goal was a remarkable 63 yards. This record-setting kick was made during a game between the Carolina Panthers and the St. Louis Rams on October 10, 1999. Kasay's second longest field goal was kicked at a distance of 56 yards. He achieved this feat twice, once in December 2001 and again in November 2002, both times while playing for the Carolina Panthers. Conclusion: In comparing John Kasay's longest and second longest field goals, we find that the difference in yardage is 7 yards. His longest field goal of 63 yards was achieved during a game in 1999, while his second longest field goal of 56 yards was attained twice, in 2001 and 2002. As we celebrate John Kasay's successful career, it's essential to acknowledge his accomplishments, including his incredible long-range field goals, which have undoubtedly left a lasting impact on NFL history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from:  --ocean tides;  --time of day;  --energy from the Sun;  --phases of the Moon;...A:","output":"The correct answer to this question is ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the Moon causes a significant effect on Earth, mainly reflected in ocean tides.  The gravitational force exerted by the Moon pulls the Earth's water on its surface, causing the oceans and other large bodies of water to bulge in the direction of the Moon. This bulge occurs on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, as well as on the opposite side. The bulge on the opposite side occurs due to an inertial force called the centrifugal force which counteracts the gravitational pull of the Moon, causing water to be slightly pushed away from the Moon on the far side of Earth. This effect causes sea levels to rise in the areas where the bulge occurs, leading to high tides. In contrast, low tides occur in the regions between the high tide areas where the water has been pulled away. The Earth's rotation makes a full turn every day, causing coastal areas to experience two high tides and two low tides every 24 hours and 50 minutes, approximately. It is essential to understand why the other options are not the correct answer: 1. Time of day: The time of day is determined by the Earth's rotation on its axis relative to the Sun. Although the Moon's gravitational pull has some influence on the Earth's rotation, causing slight variations in the length of a day, it is not the primary factor that defines the time of day. 2. Energy from the Sun: The energy Earth receives from the Sun comes in the form of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet. This energy drives the Earth's climate and weather, fuels photosynthesis, and provides the foundation for the life-sustaining processes on the planet. The Moon's gravitational force does not directly affect the energy Earth receives from the Sun. 3. Phases of the Moon: The phases of the Moon are a result of the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. As the Moon orbits Earth, it moves through different angles relative to the Sun, causing varying amounts of its illuminated surface to be visible from Earth. Although the Moon's gravitational force has an impact on Earth, particularly the ocean tides, it does not cause the phases of the Moon. In conclusion, the gravitational attraction of the Moon has a significant effect on Earth's ocean tides, as it causes the water to bulge, leading to high and low tide cycles. Other factors such as the time of day, energy from the Sun, and phases of the Moon are not directly influenced by the Moon's gravitational force on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Build a movie plot around this: What is the  deal Jane made? Jane made the deal to split the money. Answer:","output":"Title: Broken Trust Genre: Crime, Drama, Mystery Plot Summary: In a small town, an infamous heist takes place, and a tight-knit group of friends finds themselves entangled in its web. Jane, a widowed elementary school teacher, is struggling to make ends meet. Her life takes a dark turn when she is lured into making a dangerous deal with her close friend, Nick, a seemingly kind-hearted mechanic with a dark side. The story revolves around the aftermath of the heist and the web of lies, deceit, and broken trust that follows. Act 1: Introductions We are introduced to Jane, who teaches at a local school in a small, working-class town. She is in deep financial trouble after her husband’s death and struggles to raise her two kids on her own. Nick, Jane's close friend and neighbor since childhood, is shown as a compassionate man, always willing to lend a helping hand. Suddenly, a shocking heist takes place at the local bank, shattering the calm atmosphere of the small town. The mysterious robbers make off with a large sum of money, leaving the townsfolk in disarray. Act 2: A Dangerous Deal With no clues as to the robbers' identities, tension rise in the town. Jane is on the verge of losing her home due to mounting debts, when Nick approaches her with a secret proposal. He reveals that he was involved in the heist and offers to split the money with Jane if she agrees to help him launder the cash. Desperate to ease her family's financial burden, Jane makes the deal to split the money, but they must be careful to avoid suspicion. Act 3: Complications As they work together to launder the stolen money, their friendship begins to strain under the constant threat of getting caught. Jane struggles with her guilt, while Nick's increasingly paranoid and controlling behavior creates tension. The walls close in as two additional members of the heist crew reveal their involvement. They start bullying Jane, and Nick seems powerless to stop them, leading Jane to realize the deal was much more complicated than she initially thought. Act 4: The Betrayal As suspicions among the townsfolk begin to surface, one of the heist members, fearing capture, threatens to expose Jane's involvement. In a shocking twist, Jane discovers Nick has deliberately implicated her in the heist to protect himself and the other team members. Realizing her friendship with Nick was built on lies, Jane feels utterly betrayed. Act 5: Redemption and Resolution Determined to fight back and clear her name, Jane devises a plan to bring the real culprits to justice. She starts gathering evidence against her former friends. Risking everything, Jane confronts Nick and the other perpetrators, forcing a confession out of them. In the climax, the robbers are arrested, and Jane is exonerated. However, the revelation of Nick's involvement in the heist destroys the remaining threads of their friendship. Jane decides to return her share of the money to the authorities, as the cost of her integrity and her family's future is far greater than her need for ill-gotten gains.  In the end, Jane finds strength in the friendships she formed along the way with other honest members of the community. With the support of these new friends, she overcomes her financial difficulties and begins to rebuild her life."},{"instruction":"Princess Astrid, Mrs. Ferner is the older sister of a king who ascended to the throne on which day ?

To elaborate more on this statement, a highly heterogeneous agriculture refers to the diverse agricultural practices, land utilization, and crop systems across Europe due to the differences in geography, climate, and cultural factors. This diversity in European agriculture presents a challenge for creating a single policy that can address all the aspects equally and effectively. The statement emphasizes the need for a holistic approach in designing agricultural policies that consider various factors, including economic, environmental, and social aspects, without undermining the distinct regional characteristics of European agriculture. Additionally, the regional differences in Europe, such as variations in traditional farming methods and knowledge, may require a combination of both localized and centralized strategies to ensure the sustainment and development of the agricultural sector. Moreover, this translates to the need for coordination and cooperation between the European Union and national governments, as well as among different stakeholders, such as farmers, businesses, and non-governmental organizations, to develop multi-dimensional policies that cater to the diverse needs of European agriculture. By acknowledging that no single policy is sufficient to tackle the entirety of Europe's agricultural heterogeneity, it highlights the importance of continued dialogue, research, and innovation in finding the best way forward for the sustainability and resilience of agriculture throughout the continent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires.

Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet. It's just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond good? \\"Yeah, but it was no TAS.\\" Is Justice League good? \\"It's not too bad, but it's no TAS.\\" The Batman is certainly no TAS, either, but I won't hold that against it. It would be unfair and besides, it has plenty of other problems with it. The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one, and at times the art is very nice. But all of the rest of the time, the art is worthless Americanime, and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself. It is paced, written, and designed like an Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal, mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits, unpredictability, and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight hand to hand, he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do that with a villain, there were other less important characters they could have used or *gasp* they could have created a new one entirely. And it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing, don't get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegun-wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character. Of course Freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade, but the point stands. What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large, smelly dump on them. Guess what? They were eating corn. It's obvious this show can't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me. The plots aren't good and they don't develop any better.

Information:  - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - Andrew Braybrook is a software engineer, a former game programmer. He created video games such as \\"Paradroid\\", \\"Gribbly's Day Out\\", \\"Fire and Ice\\", \\"Uridium\\" and \\"Morpheus\\". He also programmed the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST conversion of the arcade game \\"Rainbow Islands\\".  - Paradroid is a Commodore 64 computer game written by Andrew Braybrook and published by Hewson Consultants in 1985. It is a shoot 'em up with puzzle elements and was critically appraised at release. The objective is to clear a fleet of spaceships of hostile robots by destroying them or taking them over via a mini-game. It was later remade as \\"Paradroid 90\\" for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers and as Paradroid 2000 for the Acorn Archimedes. There exist several fan-made remakes for modern PCs. In 2004 the Commodore 64 version was re-released as a built-in game on the C64 Direct-to-TV, and in 2008 for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe.  - Gribbly 's Day Out is a Commodore 64 game by Andrew Braybrook , released by Hewson in 1985 . It was written over a three - month period . The game is set on the planet Blabgor and centred on the exploits of Gribbly Grobbly and his attempts to rescue errant ' gribblets ' from the landscape and return them to safety . A revised version was released on the Rack - It budget label .  - The Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) is a line of home/personal computers produced starting in 1977 by Commodore International. A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80.  - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.

What is the final step of the following process: -  You breathe oxygen into your body through the nose or mouth - The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs Answer:","output":"The final step of the process after the carbon dioxide is transferred to the air sacs occurs as follows: The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air sacs (alveoli) and bloodstream is known as 'gas exchange.' After the alveoli have successfully received the carbon dioxide from the bloodstream, the body needs to expel it as a waste product. This is achieved through a process called exhalation or breathing out. During exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between the ribs) relax, and the lungs return to their original, smaller size. As the lung volume decreases, the pressure inside them increases, causing the air, which is now rich in carbon dioxide, to flow out of the lungs. This expulsion of carbon dioxide occurs when the deoxygenated air leaves the alveoli, passes through the bronchioles, and then moves into the bronchi, which eventually connect to the trachea (windpipe). The carbon dioxide-enriched air travels up the trachea and finally leaves the body through either the nose or mouth. In summary, the final step in the process involves the exhalation of carbon dioxide-rich air. This vital method of respiration not only helps to remove waste products from the body but also regulates the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, ensuring an optimal environment for the body's cells and organs to function correctly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

NPR's Nina Totenberg broke the story to the world in 1991, and she joins the NPR Politics podcast team to reflect on what happened, how it happened and why it still matters.      \\"I'd been hearing all summer long that there were women who said they were harassed by Clarence Thomas when he was at the EEOC and when he was at the Education Department,\\" Totenberg said. \\"But I could never really prove it. And then I heard about this woman, Anita Hill.\\"      That's when everything changed. Listen to the podcast at the audio link above, download it via iTunes or read highlights from the conversation below:      On what made Totenberg look for the story      Listen to Nina Totenberg's 1991 story 11:04      I'm sitting at the Judiciary Committee hearing where they are voting on Thomas and I see that they all have the same envelope. And [then-Chairman Joe] Biden starts talking about how the confirmation process should not be about rank gossip. And I go, what? What are you talking about? I go out and I start kicking tires. And eventually, I find out what it's about. I call up Anita Hill. She says she won't talk to me unless I have a copy of her affidavit. So I got it. And then I got her. I actually held the story for a day and a half, trying to get Biden to talk to me about what was going on.      On the scope of the story            Even I didn't really understand how big a deal this was going to be. I remember walking into the Capitol thinking that once again, this would be a joint PBS-NPR live coverage of the hearing and we would be the only people there, and it was an insane asylum in there. Every network on the face of the earth was carrying this live. They carried it live even when the World Series was on! They pre-empted the World Series. It was unbelievable.      On the climate of sexual harassment at the time            You don't recognize this now, but sexual harassment was a dirty little secret that most women had but they didn't talk about. They were embarrassed by it; it was a hindrance and not a help in any way. Now suddenly, it gets popped into the open. ... But all of those silent, female experiences materialized in the ... phones exploding on Capitol Hill.      On why there was so much public support for Thomas      He was so furious and so indignant and so hurt by these accusations that it was hard to believe you could be so convincing and not be telling the truth. They were both very convincing witnesses.      On the cost of breaking the story      I was pilloried during this. I had one of the great stories of any reporter's life. I had worked very hard to get it. And the cost was enormous in terms of negative publicity and people trashing me a lot and senators yelling at me. At one point I had a driver at Nightline who went around the corner [and] stopped and he said to me ... \\"Lady, you better get a gun.\\"      On how the story led to an increase in sexual harassment claims      The number of cases almost doubled in just two years that were filed at the EEOC. Workplaces began to actually have rules about this. There were rules; there were grievance procedures that people could go to to discuss it. And the other thing is the Judiciary Committee was all male and had always been all male. They made very sure that there were women on the committee right away.      On being asked to do a cameo in the movie      [HBO] wanted me to re-enact my memory of the questions I asked her, so they could have me asking her questions on the phone the first time we talked and things like that. And I said, \\"We don't do that at NPR. That's called pretend news.\\"      On why she'll never reveal her source      I didn't even tell my lawyer when they subpoenaed me. I've never told my husband. I'm taking this one to my grave. |||||       \\"Confirmation\\" by Michelle Thompson based on Associated Press photos (Michelle Thompson)      In 1991, George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas for a seat on the Supreme Court, just five days after civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall announced that he was retiring after 24 years. Thomas, despite an impressive résumé, had served as a federal judge for only 19 months. None of the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee for the Federal Judiciary members rated him “well-qualified.”      Near the end of his hearing, a former employee of Thomas’s named Anita Hill came forward with sensational allegations of sexual harassment. The testimony took three days, with the hearing broadcast live. The nation was shocked, transfixed and deeply divided.      On April 16, HBO will debut “Confirmation,” a movie starring Kerry Washington as Hill and Wendell Pierce as Thomas. Conservatives have already called the screenplay biased, portraying Hill as courageous, Thomas as disingenuous and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. as inept.      The subject is still a raw wound for Thomas: “Mere confirmation, even to the Supreme Court, seemed pitifully small compensation for what had been done to me,” he writes in his 2007 memoir “My Grandfather’s Son.”      A look at the process, in the words of those who were there.      The late Republican senator Arlen Specter (D-Pa.) in his 2000 autobiography “Passion for Truth”: Bush announced that Thomas was the “best qualified” nominee he could find for the high court and that “the fact he was black and a minority had nothing to do with this.” Immediately I said publicly that Thomas was not the best-qualified nominee available and that race was a factor — and properly so. I did not object to Thomas’s nomination because I thought he was entitled to a hearing and because on the record, with his degrees from Holy Cross and Yale Law School plus his tenure on the court of appeals, he appeared at least marginally qualified.      The late Democratic senator Paul Simon (D-Ill.) in a 1992 C-SPAN interview about his book “Advice & Consent”: Gerald Ford followed the Constitution by consulting with senators. George Bush did not. Gerald Ford contacted people around the nation and said, “Who would be the best possible person to put on the court?” and then he submitted 20 names to the American Bar Association for their evaluation. George Bush submitted one.

David Ake/AFP/Getty Images)      Given his short time on the federal bench, Thomas and his advisers settled on the “Pin Point” strategy: An emphasis on his roots in Pin Point, the poor town in Georgia where he grew up, and his personal story of hard work, family values and character. So Hill’s accusation was especially devastating for him.      Thomas’s wife, Virginia, in 1994’s “Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas” by former senator John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), who served as Thomas’s mentor during the hearings: The nature of his anxiety . . . was the humiliation factor. That seemed to be his major concern. Here was this charge that was so against everything he had done in his public life and everything he believes in his private and personal thoughts, a charge being exposed and discussed by what looked like rational people, and it was killing him. Somebody was trying to destroy him and that was the major concern. He kept saying why are they trying to destroy me? He kept asking that question over and over again.

(Greg Gibson/AP)      Hill began her testimony on Friday, Oct. 11, 1991, and was aggressively questioned by the 14 men who made up the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas absolutely denied the allegations before her appearance and again the next day.       Hill in her 1997 memoir, “Speaking Truth to Power”: My world has been forever changed by the events that culminated in the “Hill-Thomas” hearings. I am no longer an anonymous, private individual — my name having become synonymous with sexual harassment. To my supporters I represent the courage to come forward and disclose a painful truth — a courage that thousands of others have found since the hearing. To my detractors I represent the debasement of public forum, at best, a pawn, at worst, a perjurer. Living with these conflicting perceptions is difficult, sometimes overwhelming.      Simon in the C-SPAN interview: After we were in the hearing for a while, it became apparent that we had something huge on our hands in terms of public attention. That played a role in the Thomas nomination, because on Friday, Anita Hill testified. Friday is a limited television audience. Saturday, Clarence Thomas testified — a much larger audience. People who saw only one of the two believed the one they saw, whichever one that was. I think that was a factor in public opinion being on his side — only one of the factors — and the public opinion being on his side I think was clearly a factor in some of the votes in the Senate.      George H.W. Bush in a 1991 letter published in “All the Best,” a collection of his writing: What’s happening to Clarence Thomas is just plain horrible. All the groups that tried to beat him on abortion or affirmative action have now come out of the woodwork. They are trying to destroy a decent man. I do not think they will succeed but they are in a frenzy around here. . . . I know nothing of Ms. Hill but I know a lot about Clarence Thomas, with whom I visited again yesterday and continue to have total confidence in his honor and decency. This is an ugly process and one can see clearly why so many good people elect to stay out of public life.      Republicans turned the questioning to Hill and her credibility; Democrats were criticized for allowing that to happen. Biden (D-Del.), the committee chairman, was singled out by liberals for showing deference to Thomas and not calling any witnesses who could support Hill’s testimony.      Anita Hill's 1991 testimony at Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearing will breathe new life in the HBO movie \\"Confirmation.\\" Considered by many as the sexual harassment tipping point, Hill's allegations paved the way for many modern gender discussions. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)      Former senator Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) in a 2014 interview on the “Death, Sex & Money” podcast: I’d had a wife who’d had much more harassment than Anita Hill. And that’s when I lost my marbles. I thought, “What is this? I mean, for God’s sake, what did he do?” Well, nothing. “Did he touch you?” “No.” “What is it?” “He wanted to talk about Long Dong Silver and pubic hair and coke cans.” “Is that it? Is that it?” “Yes, it is. I wanted you to be aware of his behavior.” And so I was a monster. I was just pissed to the core.      Biden in Specter’s “Passion for Truth” (he omitted any mention of the hearing from his own memoir): My role, I decided — and I had great debates with my staff about it — I was going to be a judge and I was going to apply rules that were not required to be applied. . . . Out of a sense of fairness, that’s what I was going to do. And I wasn’t about, with my view of civil liberties, to attack a guy I was already against. I was against him from day one.      Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), whose checkered personal history with women effectively silenced him during the hearings, in a speech at Harvard two weeks afterward:I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than honest disagreement with my positions, or the usual criticism from the far right. It also involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight.      Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) in a 2010 CNN interview: I can tell you Clarence Thomas was telling the truth. I believe that Anita Hill was an excellent witness. I think she actually believed and talked herself into believing what she said. There was a sexual harasser at that time, according to the sources I had, and he was her supervisor, he just wasn’t Clarence Thomas. I think she transposed that to where she believed it because she was outed by the feminist women at that time and she couldn’t change her mind after — she couldn’t change her tune. And that’s what happened.      [Does HBO’s ‘Confirmation’ favor Anita Hill? Kerry Washington and others say no way.]      After Hill’s testimony, Thomas told the committee that he would not answer any further questions, angrily calling the hearing “a high-tech lynching.”      Gary Wills, the New York Review of Books, 1995 : Whatever one thinks of the lynching trope, it worked. And one aspect of Thomas’s character was vindicated — his audacity. The nerve of it is breathtaking. He had, in effect, ceded the areas of competence and constitutionalism: He was “out to lunch” when it came to subjects about which he was expected to be knowledgeable, and he gave up all his earlier comments on “natural law,” on ideas in general. He had staked everything on character — and now he would not answer any questions about his character. He sat there on his last limb, and angrily started sawing it off, with this dare: “Catch me before I fall, or you are all racist lynchers.” And, to their shame, the senators, shamefacedly, caught him. But weren’t Hill’s charges false, or at least suspect? Even if they were, Thomas’s performance did not merit confirmation. It is also a mark of character — of judicial temperament if you will — to face criticism as a lawyer, with arguments, not with torrents of invective against the committee for asking questions one does not want to hear.      Former Washington Post reporters Kevin Merida and Michael Fletcher in their 2007 biography, “Supreme Discomfort: The Divided Soul of Clarence Thomas” : The starkly different testimonies of Hill and Thomas left no possibility for misunderstanding. Wiggle room? There was none. Neither Hill nor Thomas offered a backstory about their involvement with each other that might have led the Senate — indeed the nation — to conclude something beyond the obvious: One of them was lying, period. Was lying to the committee, to the country, perhaps even to him or herself.      NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg, who reported on the Hill story, in an introduction to the 2005 published transcript of the hearing: Despite the fact that Hill took and passed a lie detector test, the two sides were no match for each other. The Thomas forces, frantic but unified, marched together to a strategic tune composed by Thomas and Danforth and orchestrated by the White House. Hill’s forces, inexperienced, in disarray, and with little or no support from Senate Democrats, were left to flounder. When it was over, public opinion polls showed the people believed Clarence Thomas by a margin of two to one, a ratio that would reverse itself in less than two years.

(Victoria Will/Invision/AP)      Although the Judiciary Committee voted not to approve Thomas’s nomination, the full Senate voted 52-48 to confirm.      Danforth in a 2009 interview with NPR’s “Tell Me More”: It’s very hard for me to say that there is anything I could have done differently because it was like walking down the street and getting in a fight in an alley. I mean, it was just awful. It was just an absolutely terrible situation. And for the people that wanted to defeat him, there was no limit, just anything goes. And I thought it was awful. And I hope that doesn’t happen to any other nominee. It’s not worth it. It’s not worth trying to destroy a human being to win a political point. . . . It’s certainly not a fight I wanted to be in. It was absolutely the worst experience of my life.      Democratic Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), in a recent interview: Across the country, the televised hearings opened the eyes of millions of people to the importance of public hearings for Supreme Court nominees. The hearings also sparked a national conversation about issues that had received scant congressional attention until then. There is also a poignant lesson from those hearings for this very moment. There was a Democratic majority in the Senate at the time and a Republican in the White House. In sharp contrast with what we’re seeing today with the [Merrick] Garland nomination, with a Republican majority calling the shots, no one back then blocked Clarence Thomas from a hearing, from a committee vote, or from a floor vote. After those revealing hearings, when the committee voted to disapprove the nomination, the committee still sent Justice Thomas’s nomination to the floor and the full Senate so that all senators could uphold their constitutional duty. We followed precedent, and we felt a responsibility to respect it.”      Danforth in “Resurrection”: Clarence Thomas, just confirmed as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, was soaking in a bath, reading, when Ginni told him the result of the vote. He shrugged at the news. . . . Clarence describes how he felt when he learned of the vote: “Not blasé but not happy. I felt I had been abused. I just felt like I went through something that shouldn’t have ever occurred.”      Hill in “Speaking Truth to Power”: What happened in October 1991 should not have happened to me or anyone else.      Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly gave credit to NPR’s Nina Totenberg for breaking the story of Anita Hill’s allegations against Clarence Thomas. A Newday story on the allegations by Timothy Phelps moved on the wire services the night before Totenberg’s report aired.      READ MORE: “Does HBO’s ‘Confirmation’ favor Anita Hill? Kerry Washington and others say no way.” |||||       \\"Confirmation\\" by Michelle Thompson based on Associated Press photos (Michelle Thompson)      In 1991, George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas for a seat on the Supreme Court, just five days after civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall announced that he was retiring after 24 years. Thomas, despite an impressive résumé, had served as a federal judge for only 19 months. None of the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee for the Federal Judiciary members rated him “well-qualified.”      Near the end of his hearing, a former employee of Thomas’s named Anita Hill came forward with sensational allegations of sexual harassment. The testimony took three days, with the hearing broadcast live. The nation was shocked, transfixed and deeply divided.      On April 16, HBO will debut “Confirmation,” a movie starring Kerry Washington as Hill and Wendell Pierce as Thomas. Conservatives have already called the screenplay biased, portraying Hill as courageous, Thomas as disingenuous and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. as inept.      The subject is still a raw wound for Thomas: “Mere confirmation, even to the Supreme Court, seemed pitifully small compensation for what had been done to me,” he writes in his 2007 memoir “My Grandfather’s Son.”      A look at the process, in the words of those who were there.      The late Republican senator Arlen Specter (D-Pa.) in his 2000 autobiography “Passion for Truth”: Bush announced that Thomas was the “best qualified” nominee he could find for the high court and that “the fact he was black and a minority had nothing to do with this.” Immediately I said publicly that Thomas was not the best-qualified nominee available and that race was a factor — and properly so. I did not object to Thomas’s nomination because I thought he was entitled to a hearing and because on the record, with his degrees from Holy Cross and Yale Law School plus his tenure on the court of appeals, he appeared at least marginally qualified.      The late Democratic senator Paul Simon (D-Ill.) in a 1992 C-SPAN interview about his book “Advice & Consent”: Gerald Ford followed the Constitution by consulting with senators. George Bush did not. Gerald Ford contacted people around the nation and said, “Who would be the best possible person to put on the court?” and then he submitted 20 names to the American Bar Association for their evaluation. George Bush submitted one.

I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. What does the man make his children do now that he is grown?

On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War.

Article: Global Positioning Systems are now a part of everyday driving in many countries. These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mister Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. Barry Brown: \\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\\" Barry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people's cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called \\"The Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS.\\" It lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers. These include maps that are outdated, incorrect or difficult to understand. They also include timing issues related to when GPS commands are given. Barry...

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - Patricia Lynn \\"Trisha\\" Yearwood (born September 19, 1964) is an American country music singer, author, and actress.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Warner Music Canada is the Canadian division of Warner Music Group.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious. When a Jehovah Witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. Although far, far more intelligent than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult) Zizek's mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. He combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. Example: there are three main Marx brothers hence what a \\"great\\" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego. I'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from \\"Snowhite\\" and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (Moslem hell). It's like the premise of Schumacher's \\"The Number 23\\": play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking Ancient Greeks with Princess Di's death. However, there is an entertainment element to TPGTC: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. Why watch \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\" or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching an amusing train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions. I have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like \\"Birds\\" this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in Slovenia these days... When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the \\"Psycho\\" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leigh's blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out (as in menstruation), this representing some kind of \\"clever (Zizekian) irony\\". Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene (and the script), his movies wouldn't have been the illogical, far-fetched crap that they often are. The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about \\"hidden, deep meanings\\". And when you add Zizek's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible. Zizek utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with \\"the satisfaction of work, of a job well done\\". Don't laugh... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of \\"Psycho\\" could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene. Talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to \\"say\\". I like Zizek's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky's terrific \\"Solaris\\", but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in \\"anti-feminism\\" and other nonsense into his theory. Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. \\"I just want to play with it all day!\\" Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him. He seems to regard logic, proof, common-sense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the end-goal, or simply annihilated. Zizek is the LSD-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal \\"2001\\"s. The fact that Zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma didn't feature more prominently; that's another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible \\"Lost Highway\\". There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it. Zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von Trier's laughable, \\"ground-breaking\\" physical set-up in \\"Dogville\\" made me snicker.  However, Zizek doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the \\"bleedin' obvious\\". Like all \\"social scientists\\" (an oxymoron), he wraps his very trite \\"observations\\" into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener.

She then tried to do the same thing with a glass tube. One of them bent into a circle and the other one broke. Which one did she successfully bend into a circle? (A) the rubber tube (B) the glass tube  Choose the answer between \\"a glass tube\\" and \\"a rubber tube\\". Answer:","output":"The answer to the logic test is \\"a rubber tube.\\" Let's analyze both options: (A) Rubber tube: Rubber is a flexible and elastic material, which means it can be bent and stretched without breaking. This property allows it to return to its original shape after being bent or stretched. When Vicky tried to bend the rubber tube into a circle, its flexibility and elasticity enabled her to successfully create the desired shape. Rubber tubes are often used in applications where flexibility is needed, such as hoses and tubing for various fluid transfer purposes. (B) Glass tube: Glass, on the other hand, is a rigid and brittle material. It is not designed to withstand bending or stretching forces. When Vicky tried to bend the glass tube into a circle, it was unable to handle the stress being applied to it, causing it to crack or break. Glass tubes are used in applications where rigidity and transparency are required, such as laboratory equipment or decorative purposes. However, they are not suitable for applications where bending or manipulation is necessary. Therefore, based on the material properties and the outcome presented in the logic test, Vicky was able to successfully bend the rubber tube into a circle, while the glass tube broke."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The second is stabbed on a street in New Orleans while observing a restaurant called Fillet of Soul; his body is secreted in the coffin of a passing funeral procession. The third agent is killed on the island of San Monique during a voodoo rites ceremony; the high priest uses a poisonous snake to kill the man.James Bond is ordered by his boss, M, to investigate the deaths and their connections to Kananga. He is sent to New York City, where the first agent was killed and where Kananga is currently visiting the UN. As soon as Bond arrives in New York City, his driver is killed while taking him to meet Felix Leiter of the CIA and Bond narrowly escapes a potentially fatal car wreck. The driver's killer leads Bond to Mr. Big, a gangster who runs the chain of Fillet of Soul restaurants throughout the United States. It is during his confrontation with Mr. Big that Bond first meets Solitaire, a beautiful virgin tarot expert who has the uncanny ability to see both the future and remote events in the present.

Background: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired.  The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases.  Paragraph: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture.

SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points. Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select. Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts. Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections. Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast. They use Weather Bank as one of their tools. OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select  Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well. Lots of complaints. People were complaining that it restricted access to the system. Eliminating point specific calculation. Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits. Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures. No changes to Wheeler Ridge. Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle. Replace windows with operational maximum volumes. If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows. Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 . No direct dial-up. Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party. However, can still make  changes. Can still upload new files. 2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO. Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers. Gas Select is official notification. Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail. Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free. OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific. OFO's can be declared intraday. Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day. Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on. Don't want to go back and forth. This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works. Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned. Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage. Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week. Can revise expected usage. No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO. Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy. Generators need to revise expected usage. Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal. Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4. Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed. If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules. Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised. If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:  Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized. Will allocate prorata. Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point. In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered. For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week. Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume. For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes. For example:           Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3\\t\\t\\t\\tevening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4  In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th. ; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama has warned Russia that targeted sanctions are \\"ready to go,\\" as the Geneva agreement to de-escalate the crisis falters. Officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow, in their view, continues to aggravate the situation. Key Putin allies, high-profile Russian oligarchs and possibly Russian institutions and companies, will be targeted, CNN has been told. Obama, at a news conference Friday in South Korea, said he would be talking to other European leaders about sanctions against Russia as the Ukraine crisis worsens. The West has already introduced sanctions, imposing financial and visa restrictions on around 30 Russian and Ukrainian officials -- but stopping short of measures that would hit trade. On the flip-side, the","output":"Russian government, led by President Vladimir Putin, has remained defiant in the face of these warnings. Moscow has responded to the threat of sanctions by ramping up support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and continuing to make strategic moves within the region. This has resulted in further fracturing of diplomatic relations between Russia and the West, as well as increased violence throughout Ukraine. As the crisis deepens and tensions continue to escalate on both sides, the story reaches its climax when a turning point occurs. Several European countries, along with the United States, decide that sanctions alone are not enough to deter Russia's advances. In a bold move, they agree to provide military aid to the struggling Ukrainian government, enabling them to better combat the pro-Russian separatists. This shift in strategy causes Russia to reevaluate its stance. The risk of direct conflict with Western forces and the potential suffering of Russian citizens due to increased sanctions forces President Putin to rethink his approach. In a last-ditch effort to avoid the worst-case scenario, Putin sends emissaries to the negotiating table with the European Union, the United States, and the Ukrainian government. Lengthy and heated negotiations take place, with all parties making tough compromises to reach a deal. Ultimately, Russia agrees to withdraw its support for the separatists in exchange for guarantees that Ukraine will not enact legislation aimed at joining NATO in the near future. Additionally, both sides pledge to work together to stabilize and rebuild war-torn parts of eastern Ukraine with the help of international organizations. The story ends on a cautiously optimistic note. While many challenges remain – rebuilding and sustaining peace in a deeply divided nation, reestablishing trust between Russia and the West, and reevaluating the role of international alliances – the world can breathe a sigh of relief as the threat of an all-out war fades into the background. However, the conclusion is not without its costs. Lives have been lost, economies damaged, and the scars of this crisis will be felt by many for years to come. The question of whether or not this newfound peace will endure remains to be seen, but for now, the world can hope that lessons have been learned and history will not repeat itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When people walk into a Pizza Hut in Tokyo, Rome, or Miami, they know exactly what they are getting. Through franchising, an investor   can make use of this brand power by opening a Pizza Hut of his or her own. The risk is low, and the rewards can be big. No wonder franchising is such a successful business model. Franchising had been around for more than 100 years, but its popularity took off in the 1950s. Leading the trend were fast food restaurant like McDonald's. These days, there are franchises in more than eighty-five industries, including dry cleaning, hotels and supermarkets. It's a very big business. In the US, there are some 760,000 franchises, totaling more than 1.5 trillion in yearly revenues (income). There are two sides in a franchise: the franchisor--the owner of the business system and the franchisee--the person who licenses the system. After signing a \\"franchise agreement\\", the franchisee pays a fee. He or she also pays for equipment, supplies, and, if necessary, building costs. The total investment usually ranges from 10,000 to 1,000,000. After the business opens, the franchisee also pays a percentage of sales revenues--called a royalty--to the franchisor. Marking fees must also be paid. In return, the franchisee receives many benefits. Training is among the most common ones. It includes everything from dealing with customers to understanding the company's standards. The franchisor also handles advertising. On top of that, there's the benefit of the brand reputation that the company has built up. All of these benefits make the risk of opening a franchise much smaller than that of starting a business from scratch. However, a franchise can also have drawbacks. If a customer at a single restaurant gets sick, it may hurt every franchise in the system. Running a franchise also means closely following the company's standards. So, one has to give up a degree of independence. You have to do things their way and trust that the system... Question: What is the most important factor to make a franchise successful?

Speak up: Aubrey should tell Remy that their behavior is not acceptable and that it makes them feel uncomfortable or hurt. This will give Remy a chance to reflect on their actions and possibly change. 2. Share feelings with a trusted friend or family member: Talking to someone who understands and supports Aubrey can provide relief and help them process the situation more effectively. Additionally, they might also suggest helpful advice or strategies. 3. Seek help from an authority figure: Aubrey can report the bullying to a teacher, school counselor, or another adult in a position of authority. They can provide guidance, support, and potentially intervene, addressing the issue with Remy and their parents if necessary. 4. Maintain self-confidence: Aubrey should keep in mind that they do not deserve to be bullied and remind themselves of their strengths and positive qualities. This will help them maintain their self-esteem during difficult times. 5. Document incidents: Keeping a record of bullying incidents can be useful when speaking to authority figures about the situation. Dates, times, locations, and a description of what happened should be included in this record. 6. Practice self-care and stress reduction: Aubrey should engage in activities that promote mental and physical well-being, such as exercise, spending time with positive influences, or engaging in hobbies they enjoy. This will help reduce stress and build resilience against the negative effects of bullying.

Article: In the US, elementary and middle schools are advised to give students two and a half hours of physical activity a week. That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Criticism of the cuts has led in some places to efforts to give students more time for exercise, not less. The future health of Americans may depend on it. A study reports that life expectancy has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in obesity,smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only 4% of elementary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools. The study also found that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E. One problem for P. E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P. E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition to personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga. Some parents like the idea of avoiding competitive sports in P. E. class. Yet others surely dislike that idea. _ . Question: Which statement is TRUE? Options: A: High schools in the US should provide fewer hours of physical activity than that in elementary and middle schools. B: Not all schools in the US have reduced their physical education programs. C: 22% of all schools in the US require students to take any P. E. D: 8% of middle schools provide daily physical education all year for all grades now. A:","output":"The true statement among the given options is B: Not all schools in the US have reduced their physical education programs. The article does mention that \\"many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs,\\" but it doesn't claim that all schools have done so. The other options are either clearly contradicted by the text or lack sufficient evidence in the article to be considered true. For example, option A contradicts the article's information that high schools should provide more, not fewer, hours of physical activity than elementary and middle schools. Similarly, option D overstates the article's figure, which says that 8% of middle schools provided daily physical education as of 2006, not necessarily \\"now\\".

Please write a short summary for the following article: Japan Quake One Year Anniversary As the surge of water smashed through the factory wall in northeast Japan a year ago, Takumi Tanaka held on to an air hose to stop being swept away. Four days later, he was back at the shattered auto-parts plant, groping through meter-thick mud studded with uprooted trees. One year after Japanâs most powerful earthquake ever, the nationâs top two political parties have record-low approval ratings, signaling widespread discontent at the governmentâs response to the disaster. Japanâs Emperor will lead millions of the countryâs citizens in prayers and remembrances today for the more than 19,000 killed or lost in the quake and tsunami that struck at 2:46 p.m. one year ago. Some train services in Tokyo will halt temporarily as part of the memorial. Less than half of the evacuees from the Fukushima nuclear crisis have filed for compensation from Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) because the application forms are too complex, a survey shows. Flight engineer Tsutomu Kimura had his first look into the smoking ruins of the No. 3 reactor building when his helicopter buzzed over the Fukushima Dai-Ichi (9501) atomic plant three days after it exploded. Chikako Abeâs desk is decorated with flowers and candy at her school in Minamisoma, a reminder of a 17-year-old life cut short a year ago. Instead of attending a graduation ceremony this month, her family will pray on March 11 at the ruins of a house where the sea snatched away the lives of Chikako, her father and two grandparents. The first rules for U.S. reactors imposed in response to last yearâs nuclear disaster in Japan are fueling a debate over the adequacy and cost of the measures. After years of criticism for public- works spending that rewarded political constituents at the cost of adding debt, Japan succeeded in cutting the largesse in half. Now, that legacy of success is hampering an economic rebound. Tokyoâs preparedness for dealing with a major earthquake after last yearâs record temblor in northeast Japan that left more than 19,000 dead or missing may not significantly cut deaths or damage, says Kazuchika Asano, who has studied the cityâs emergency procedures for two decades. As five-year-olds charge through the corridors of a kindergarten in northeast Japan at lunchtime, teacher Junko Kamada says she is still unsure if their food is safe a year after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Japanâs economic rebound from the deepest contraction among advanced nations after Greece and Portugal may be stunted this year as power shortages threaten its western region. Japanâs former Prime Minister Naoto Kan received a mixed assessment of his handling of last yearâs Fukushima nuclear disaster from an independent panel. Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) is set to receive a government bailout that may cost as much as 11 trillion yen (137 billion) after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the largest in Japan since the rescue of the banking industry in the 1990s. Japanâs atomic safety rules are inferior to global standards and left the country unprepared for the Fukushima nuclear disaster last March, the countryâs top nuclear regulator told a parliamentary investigation. A Hawaiian theme park that propped up the economy of a rural Japanese town in Fukushima prefecture for 45 years was forced to close after the March 11 earthquake. Almost a year later, the hula girls have returned. An earthquake of 9.0 magnitude struck Japan on March 11, 2011 at 2:46 p.m. local time, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that engulfed large parts of northeastern Japan and damaged the Fukushima nuclear plant Photographer James Whitlow Delano visited the area near the Fukushima Power Plant that was damaged by the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 to document how the landscape has changed.","output":"One year after a big earthquake and tsunami happened in Japan, people are still remembering the 19,000 people who died or were lost. Many people are not happy with how the government helped after the disaster. Some families who had to leave their homes because of the nuclear crisis have not been able to get help because the process is too difficult. Japan's economy is recovering slowly, and the country is working on making their atomic safety rules better. People still worry about their safety, like if their food is safe to eat, and if their city is prepared for another big earthquake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the most logical next event? How to make lemon mousse  Crack 3 whole eggs into a heat-proof bowl.  Add the yolks only of 3 separated eggs.  Place the egg whites into a separate bowl and refrigerate.","output":"The most logical next event in making lemon mousse is to prepare the lemon mixture. Here's a step-by-step process, continuing from where you left off: 1. Add sugar to the bowl with the whole eggs and egg yolks: Measure approximately 150g of granulated sugar and add it to the heat-proof bowl containing the whole eggs and egg yolks.  2. Whisk the egg mixture: Using a hand whisk or an electric mixer, whisk the egg and sugar mixture until it is pale, thick, and creamy. This may take a few minutes, depending on the equipment used. The mixture should have a ribbon-like consistency when the whisk is lifted. 3. Add lemon zest and juice: Zest 2-3 fresh lemons, depending on their size, into the egg and sugar mixture. Then cut the lemons and squeeze approximately 160ml of lemon juice, adding it to the mixture as well. Gently whisk the ingredients together until combined. 4. Prepare the double boiler: Place the bowl with the egg, sugar, and lemon mixture over a saucepan filled with simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. The steam from the simmering water will warm the mixture, allowing it to cook gently without scrambling the eggs. 5. Cook the lemon custard: Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula while it's over the double boiler. This will ensure even cooking and prevent the mixture from sticking to the bowl. Continue to cook until the mixture thickens and reaches a custard-like consistency. The thickening process may take approximately 10-15 minutes. Once the desired thickness is reached, remove the bowl from the heat. 6. Melt the gelatin: While the lemon custard is cooling, prepare the gelatin. Measure approximately 8g of unflavored gelatin and dissolve it in 60ml of cold water. Once it's softened, gently heat the gelatin mixture in the microwave for a few seconds or using a small saucepan until it becomes liquid. Do not overheat the gelatin, as this may affect its ability to set the mousse later on. 7. Combine the custard and gelatin: Once both mixtures have cooled for a few minutes, add the liquid gelatin to your lemon custard. Mix it thoroughly to ensure that the mixtures are fully combined. 8. Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip approximately 350ml of heavy whipping cream until it forms soft peaks. Be careful not to over-whip the cream, as this can cause the mousse to become grainy. 9. Fold the cream into the custard mixture: Once the custard has cooled to room temperature, gently fold the whipped cream into the lemon mixture by using a spatula or a large spoon. Be careful not to deflate the mixture while folding. 10. Whip the egg whites: Retrieve the egg whites stored in the refrigerator and whip them using a clean electric mixer or a hand whisk until they form stiff peaks. It is essential to ensure that the bowl and whisk are completely free of grease or moisture, as this can prevent the egg whites from whipping properly. 11. Fold the egg whites into the mousse: Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the lemon mousse mixture using a spatula or a large spoon, being careful not to deflate the mixture. 12. Transfer the mixture to serving dishes: Once all the components are well combined, scoop or pipe the lemon mousse into individual serving glasses, cups, or a large serving bowl. 13. Refrigerate the lemon mousse: Cover the servings with plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight. This step is necessary for allowing the mousse to set properly. 14. Garnish and serve: Once the mousse is set, garnish it with lemon zest, whipped cream, or fresh berries before serving.

Dr. Keloid recognizes that Rose needs immediate surgery and decides to perform a radical procedure on her, one which uses morphogenetically neutral grafts of her own skin to patch the injured tissues in and on her chest and abdomen. The treated skin will be able to form new tissue of whatever type it is grafted to, but it also might lead to cancer.A month or two passes. Hart has already gone home to Montreal, but Rose still remains in a coma at the Keolid Clinic. Then one night, one of the other patients, Lloyd Walsh (J. Roger Periad), hears Rose screaming and goes to her room. She has awakened and is pulling out her I.V. drip tube. In an attempt to warm her and calm her down, Lloyd holds her, and Rose causes some sort of vague injury to him as she holds him. When examined a few hours later, Lloyd can't remember anything afterwards, and the doctor doesn't know what caused his injury to his right arm. They know only that his blood isn't clotting from the small wound and that Lloyd's right side has no feeling. Dr. Keloid thinks that it might have been a mild stroke and transfers him to Montreal General Hospital for further evaluation.Over the next few days, Rose... My question: What are Hart's injuries?

He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed.

He has chosen this romantic setting for its serene beauty, and in one hand holds a ring that represents a lifetime of commitment and shared experiences. After a moment of anticipation, his partner says \\"yes\\" to the proposal, and amidst tears of joy and relief, they embrace each other passionately. Friends and family, who had been hiding in the background, join them to celebrate and shower them with blessings. 2. Grieving a Loss: The man could be visiting the beach as a place of solace and reflection. Perhaps he is mourning the loss of a loved one, whose ashes have been scattered across the sand. The man grievingly reaches for the sand, allowing it to slip through his fingers while remembering the fond memories he had with the departed. As a means of remembering the person, he writes their name on the sand and places flowers around it, finding comfort in the beautiful, transient nature of the tribute. 3. Building a Sandcastle: The setting could be a beach where the man decides to engage in the nostalgic activity of building sandcastles. With precise movements and artistic focus, he starts to gather wet sand, molding it into the foundation of a majestic structure. As the sandcastle gains form and complexity, passersby admire his craftsmanship, some even stopping to take pictures. His concentration and determination are enchanting, bringing joy and delight to those who get to witness such creative expression. 4. Meditation and Contemplation: The man could be practicing mindfulness and meditation on a quiet beach.

The passionate vegetarian calls on people to give up meat once a week. The campaign argues that this will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 843,000 have signed up - including Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Article:","output":"Title: Sir Paul McCartney's Meat-Free Monday Rap: A Passionate Plea for the Environment Legendary musician, Sir Paul McCartney, has never been shy about expressing his views on pressing global issues; and his latest venture – rapping for a cause – proved to be no exception. The iconic Beatles singer has turned his hand to rapping in a new YouTube video aimed at promoting the Meat-Free Monday campaign, a petition urging individuals to reduce their meat consumption to help combat climate change. While McCartney's surname has for decades been synonymous with the Beatles and groundbreaking music, this newly-formed foray into rap has instead garnered attention for its unintended comic relief, as viewers witness the 79-year old donning an unconvincing accent and employing amusing hand gestures throughout the performance. The clip has swiftly taken on the unenviable label of 'Dad-rap,' prompting a mixture of laughter and cringing from a broad audience on social media platforms. However, irrespective of the seemingly awkward delivery, the sincerity of McCartney's message cannot be overlooked. The passionate vegetarian has long been a staunch advocate for animal rights and environmental causes, and this novel rap is merely his latest attempt to enlighten the public to the myriad benefits of reducing meat consumption. Through McCartney's idiosyncratic lyrics and performance, he implores his audience to \\"give up meat once a week\\" in the hope that this lifestyle change will have a profound impact on our planet's fragile state. The Meat-Free Monday campaign, founded by McCartney along with his children, Mary and Stella, in 2009, underscores the importance of adopting an environmentally conscious lifestyle by positing that the simple act of going meat-free just once a week can substantially decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Raising animals for food production is known to be a significant contributor to global warming, with the livestock sector responsible for roughly 14.5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The McCartney's argument aligns with the mounting evidence that advocates for a global shift towards plant-based diets as a means to combat climate change. The campaign has amassed considerable support from celebrities and the general public alike, with roughly 843,000 signatures to date. The ever-growing list of endorsers includes notable names such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Their collective commitment to embrace a meat-free lifestyle every Monday not only raises awareness of the environmental benefits, but also underscores the potential health advantages associated with a diet lower in animal-based products. To conclude, Sir Paul McCartney's unique approach to promoting the Meat-Free Monday campaign through his rap video, as cringeworthy as it might be, has effectively sparked plenty of conversation and intrigue surrounding the cause. By addressing the environmental issues plaguing our planet, McCartney inspires a legion of admirers – including A-list supporters – to make a small, yet significant change in their dietary habits. Ultimately, the ripple effect of this impassioned plea may have a lasting impact on steering humanity towards a more sustainable and compassionate future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of fewer people can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of water pollution and its consequences on natural water sources such as rivers and lakes. Direct effects:  1. Reduced human population could lead to a decrease in industrial activities, resulting in lower levels of pollutants being released into water sources. This could potentially improve water quality. 2. Fewer people can also translate into less domestic waste production, which includes the dumping of untreated sewage or solid waste in water sources. As a consequence, this may improve the water quality in rivers and lakes. Indirect effects: 1. With fewer people, there might be a shift in land use, such as reduced urbanization and agricultural activities, which can lead to a decrease in runoff pollutants entering water sources and ultimately improving water quality. 2. A lower population may also lead to greater awareness and implementation of sustainable practices, such as wastewater treatment and recycling, improving water quality and reducing negative impacts on aquatic life. However, the improvement in water quality and the health of plants and animals is not guaranteed, as it greatly depends on the implementation of environmental conservation measures and proper waste management.

Given the context: What will Lee want to do next?  Possible answers: shoe shop next, help next, sing a song next A:","output":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Lee has successfully cleaned their shoes and has made a positive impression on the others, who are now asking for help in getting their own shoes clean. It is evident that Lee has demonstrated some skill or technique in cleaning shoes that the others find impressive. Taking into consideration the given options - opening a shoe shop, helping the others, or singing a song - the most logical choice for what Lee might want to do next would be to help the others clean their shoes. By doing this, Lee would be extending a gesture of goodwill and camaraderie, which in turn would likely strengthen their relationships with the others. The option to open a shoe shop may not be relevant or practical in this immediate context, as it would likely require a significant amount of time, planning, and resources that might not be readily available or related to the current situation. Furthermore, it is unclear whether others would be interested in making purchases from a shoe shop based solely on the observation that Lee can clean their own shoes well. As for singing a song, while it might serve as an entertaining or lighthearted way to pass the time or celebrate Lee's success in cleaning their shoes, it does not directly address the issue at hand or meet the needs of the others who are seeking help with their shoes. Both opening a shoe shop and singing a song could potentially be seen as off-topic or even dismissive responses to the requests for help, which could inadvertently lead to feelings of annoyance or disappointment. In conclusion, given the available options, it would be most beneficial and appropriate for Lee to offer their help to the others in need of assistance with cleaning their shoes.

The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehending Hunt. The 15th Hussars were then summoned by the magistrate, Mr Hulton, to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 18 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian, but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial.

Sentence 2: It is important to test so-called \`\` ethnographic universals '' against the human file . Do these two sentences convey the same information? Available choices: (A). no. (B). yes.","output":"(A). No. Although the two sentences seem similar at first glance, they convey slightly different information due to the terms used. The main difference between the two sentences lies in the choice of words: \\"human record\\" and \\"human file\\". In Sentence 1, the term \\"human record\\" suggests a broader, more comprehensive collection of information about human societies, histories, and cultures. This record includes all available data related to human lives, behaviors, and interactions, which can be found in various sources such as documents, artifacts, or oral histories. By testing \\"ethnographic universals\\" against the human record, Sentence 1 implies that these supposed universal features of human cultures should be scrutinized using the vast body of information that encompasses human experiences across different societies and historical periods. On the other hand, Sentence 2 uses the term \\"human file\\", which might imply a more specific and limited set of documents, records, or data points about a particular human society or subject. The human file is a subset within the broader human record. The focus on the human file might suggest a narrower range of evidence used to test the validity of ethnographic universals. In conclusion, while both sentences emphasize the importance of testing ethnographic universals against some kind of human data, Sentence 1 discusses this process in the context of the broader, comprehensive human record, whereas Sentence 2 refers to a potentially more specific and limited range of data, the human file. Therefore, the two sentences do not convey the same information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Write an article with the title: \\"Christmas carnage in Nigeria; 5 churches bombed\\" Article:","output":"Title: Christmas Carnage in Nigeria; 5 Churches Bombed Introduction: Tragedy struck on Christmas day in Nigeria, as multiple explosions rocked five churches, turning what should have been a day of celebration and reverence into one of horror and mourning. In a series of coordinated attacks, the bombings resulted in numerous casualties, with innocent worshippers and bystanders becoming victims of senseless violence. 1. The incidents The attacks began early on Christmas morning as people gathered to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ in churches across Nigeria. The first bombing took place in the town of Madalla near the country's capital, Abuja, while subsequent attacks occurred in Jos, Gadaka, and Damaturu. As of now, it is believed that radical Islamist extremists are behind these wicked acts of terrorism, although no group has yet claimed responsibility. 2. The casualties The bombings have left countless families mourning the loss of their loved ones on a day that's typically filled with warmth, joy, and a sense of community. At least 37 people have been reported dead, with over 50 injured in the devastating blasts. The death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are recovered from the rubble. 3. Purpose of the attacks It is believed that the attacks were carefully planned and executed to target Christian worshippers during the Christmas celebrations. By bombing churches on Christmas day, the attackers aimed to exploit religious differences and instigate further unrest among Nigeria's diverse population. This is not the first time Nigeria has experienced religious tension; an escalation of violence could deepen social divides and usher in more suffering for civilians already grappling with ongoing threats to their safety. 4. The government's response In the wake of the bombings, Nigeria's government has issued statements condemning the attacks and promising to apprehend those responsible. However, these efforts may be hindered by the country's limited resources and ongoing security issues. In the past, the Nigerian government has struggled to contain insurgency within its borders, and the recent attacks have brought the nation's vulnerability into sharp focus. 5. The impact on Nigerian society The Christmas carnage has sent shockwaves through Nigerian society, not only for the innocent lives lost but also for the ongoing religious tension that plagues the country. As Nigeria struggles to recover from this horrific incident, the country's unity faces a formidable challenge. It is essential that leaders of all faiths work together to promote peace, understanding, and reconciliation in the wake of this tragedy. Conclusion: The loss of lives on Christmas day due to the coordinated bombings of five churches in Nigeria is a heart-wrenching reminder of the ongoing struggle for peace and unity in the country. As people mourn the victims of this senseless violence, it's crucial for the nation to come together and overcome its challenges. Ultimately, Nigeria's path to stability and prosperity lies in finding a peaceful resolution to internal conflicts and fostering a sense of unity among its diverse population."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The bedroom door opened and a light went on, signaling an end to nap time.The toddle , sleepy-eyed, clambered to a swinging stand in his crib.He smiled, reached out to his father, and uttered what is fast becoming the cry of his generation: \\"iPhone!\\" Just as adults have a hard time putting down their iPhones, so the device is now the Toy of Choice for many 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds.The phenomenon is attracting the attention and concern of some childhood development specialists. Natasha Sykes, a mother of two in Atlanta, remembers the first time her daughter, Kelsey, now 3 but then barely 2 years old, held her husband's iPhone.\\"She pressed the button and it lit up.I just remember her eyes.It was like 'Whoa!' \\"The parents were charmed by their daughter's fascination.But then, said Ms.Sykes (herself a Black Berry user), \\"She got serious about the phone.\\" Kelsey would ask for it.Then she'd cry for it.\\"It was like she'd always want the phone,\\" Ms.Sykes said.

The sleepy-eyed toddler who called for the iPhone is one of hundreds of iPhone-loving toddlers whose parents are often proud of their offspring's ability to slide fat fingers across the gadget's screen and pull up photographs of their choice. Many iPhone apps on the market are aimed directly at preschoolers, many of them labeled \\"educational,\\" such as Toddler Teasers: Shapes, which asks the child to tap a circle or square or triangle; and Pocket Zoo, which streams live video of animals at zoos around the world. Along with fears about dropping and damage, however, many parents sharing iPhones with their young ones feel guilty.They wonder whether it is indeed an educational tool, or a passive amusement like television.The American Academy of Pediatrics is continually reassessing its guidelines to address new forms of \\"screen time.\\" Dr.Gwenn Schurgin O'Keeffe, a member of the academy's council, said, \\"We always try to throw in the latest technology, but the cellphone industry is becoming so complex that we always come back to the table and wonder- Should we have a specific guideline for _ \\" Tovah P. Klein, the director of a research center for Toddler Development worries that fixation on the iPhone screen every time a child is out with parents will limit the child's ability to experience the wider world. As with TV in earlier generations, the world is increasingly divided into those parents who do allow iPhone use and those who don't. A recent post on UrbanBaby.com, asked if anyone had found that their child was more interested in playing with their iPhone than with real toys. The Don't mothers said on the Website: \\"We don't let our toddler touch our iPhones ... it takes away from creative play.\\" \\"Please ... just say no. It is not too hard to distract a toddler with, say ... a book.\\" Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a psychology professor who specializes in early language development, sides with the Don'ts. Research shows that children learn best through activities that help them adapt to the particular situation at hand and interacting with a screen doesn't qualify, she said. Still, Dr. Hirsh-Pasek, struck on a recent visit to New York City by how many parents were handing over their iPhones to their little children in the subway, said she understands the impulse . \\"This is a magical phone,\\" she said. \\"I must admit I'm addicted to this phone.\\" 1. what signals end of nap? 2. who did he reach out for? 3. who are apps aiming for? 4. who is Natasha's daughter? 5. how old? 6. what about then? 7. what is the name of the doctor mentioned? 8. she's a member of? 9. what was the recent post on? 10. is there a particular phone mentione?","output":"1.

Given these facts, urine is a product of what organ of the body that is excreted by the urinary system among the following options: - bowel  - epidermal  - bladder  - alveoli  - lungs  - urine  - mammals  - NaCl The answer is:","output":"The bladder. To provide a detailed explanation, it is essential to understand the process of urine formation and the role each organ plays in the urinary system. The urinary system is responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the bloodstream, regulating electrolytes and fluid balance, and producing and excreting urine. The primary organs involved in this process are the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Among the given options, the bladder is the correct answer as it is a part of the urinary system and stores urine before it is excreted from the body. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how urine is produced and excreted by the urinary system: 1. Kidneys: The kidneys are the primary organs responsible for filtering waste products, excess water, and electrolytes from the blood to form urine. This process occurs in the nephrons, the functional units of the kidneys, where blood is filtered through a structure called the glomerulus, and the filtrate (containing water, ions, and waste products) enters the renal tubules. 2. Renal Tubules: As the filtrate passes through the renal tubules, essential substances like glucose, amino acids, and some ions are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. Additionally, the tubules secrete waste products and excess ions into the filtrate, further concentrating it. The remaining fluid, now called urine, is collected in the renal pelvis. 3. Ureters: The urine is then transported from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters, which are muscular tubes that extend from the renal pelvis to the base of the bladder. The ureters use peristalsis, rhythmic contractions of their smooth muscle walls, to move the urine along. 4. Bladder: The bladder is a muscular, balloon-shaped organ that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted. As it fills with urine, the bladder expands, and the internal pressure increases. When it reaches a certain capacity, the nervous system triggers the urge to urinate. 5. Urethra: Finally, urine is expelled from the body through the urethra during the process of urination (micturition). The urethral sphincter, a ring of muscles located at the junction of the bladder and urethra, controls this process. When the sphincter relaxes, urine flows through the urethra and out of the body. In summary, the bladder is the organ among the given options that is involved in the excretion of urine by the urinary system. It stores the liquid waste produced by the kidneys before it is eliminated from the body through the urethra."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information.

McCoy's started well mentally and physically, as he kissed the Eagles logo and embraced Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, as well as racking up 63 yards on 12 carries. After halftime, he started to fall apart. McCoy only rushed for 8 carries and 11 yards in the 2nd half, and after the game, he was not on the field to interact with his former teammates and did not shake hands with coach Kelly, which McCoy said he wouldn't do prior to Week 14. The game started off well for Philly, besides a first down rush by McCoy, the Buffalo offense was forced to punt after 5 plays, and on the ensuing drive, Darren Sproles rushed for 15 yards to put his team on the 1 yard line, then ran it in for a TD on the next play. The Bills answered with a Tyrod Taylor pass ro Sammy Watkins, a catch and run that went 47 yards for a TD. After several more drives, the Eagles strike again in the second quarter, with first rounder Nelson Agholor getting his first career touchdown on a 53-yard catch and run. The Bills could only muster a Dan Carpenter field goal, which was countered by a Caleb Sturgis field goal with 5 seconds left in the half. The second half started with a Caleb Sturgis field goal, but the Bills scored 10 unanswered points, then intercepted Sam Bradford on the ensuing drive. The score stayed 20-20 until the fourth quarter, where Sturgis kicked another field goal with 3 minutes left. The Bills started to gain some momentum, but a rushed pass led to an interception by backup safety Ed Reynolds clinching the game for the Eagles. With the win, the Eagles improved to 6-7, but remained in second place in the NFC East due to a win by the Redskins. How many total rushing yards did LeSean McCoy have throughout the entire game?","output":"LeSean McCoy had a total of 74 rushing yards throughout the entire game. In the first half, he accumulated 63 yards on 12 carries. In the second half, he gained only 11 yards on 8 carries.

Paragraph: As for engravings, Durer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector Albert of Mainz; Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer; Philipp Melanchthon, and Erasmus of Rotterdam. For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \\"The Four Books on Human Proportion\\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.

Step 2: Identify the process The process that combines genes from two different parents is sexual reproduction. Step 3: Determine the mechanism behind the process The mechanism behind sexual reproduction that leads to genetically diverse offspring is the fusion of male and female gametes through a process called fertilization. Step 4: Explain the process In sexual reproduction, organisms produce gametes (sperm and egg cells) that contain half the number of chromosomes as the parent organism. This is achieved through a process called meiosis, which reduces the chromosome number and increases genetic diversity by shuffling the genes. When the male gamete (sperm) fuses with the female gamete (egg) during fertilization, it forms a zygote that contains a complete set of chromosomes from both parents. This results in offspring with genetic diversity, as they inherit a unique combination of genes from both parents.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?   A). take a small knife and cut a slit at the thickest part to get a peak at the inside color.  B). take a small knife and cut a slit at the thinnest part to get a peak at the inside color.","output":"Option A) which involves taking a small knife and cutting a slit at the thickest part of the meat to get a peek at the inside color, generally makes more sense when trying to determine if meat is properly cooked on a charcoal BBQ. This is due to several reasons. First, the thickest part of the meat is the last to get fully cooked. The heat from the BBQ must pass through the outer layers of the meat to reach the centre, so when the thickest part is cooked, it implies that the other, thinner parts are also cooked. Moreover, observing the color at the thickest part gives a more accurate indication of the overall doneness of the meat. Changes that occur as meat cooks, such as browning and changes in texture, happen from the outside in. That’s why the exterior (especially thinner parts) of a piece of meat can look cooked well before the interior is done to the required level. If you cut into the thinnest part (Option B) and it appears cooked, this does not ensure the entire cut of meat has reached a safe internal temperature as the thicker parts might still be undercooked. This could increase the risk of foodborne illnesses, especially when dealing with meat like chicken or pork that can harbor harmful bacteria. However, it's also important to note that repeatedly cutting into your meat while it's cooking will allow juices to escape, potentially resulting in a drier cut. Therefore, a more reliable method of telling if your meat is properly cooked is to use a meat thermometer. Insert it into the thickest part of the meat (without touching the bone if there is one) because this will give you the most accurate reading. For safety, different types of meat should be cooked to different internal temperatures. For example, chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) while steak and other whole cuts of beef should reach at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). And remember, meat will continue to cook a bit after it's taken off the grill due to residual heat, known as carryover cooking.  To sum up, while cutting a slit in the thickest part to see the inside color can give you a general indication of doneness, using a meat thermometer to ensure it's reached the correct internal temperature is the most accurate way to ensure your meat is properly cooked on a charcoal BBQ."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. He noticed that patient A's blood vessels are constricted, but blood vessels of patient B are dilated. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his observation.  and a hint : Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.  Please answer this question : Would patient B's blood vessels be narrower or wider than patient A's? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, patient B's blood vessels would be wider than patient A's.  This is because patient A has constricted blood vessels, meaning the muscular walls of their blood vessels have contracted, causing a reduced diameter and subsequently limiting the flow of blood through these vessels. On the other hand, patient B has dilated blood vessels, indicating that the walls of their blood vessels have relaxed. As a result, the diameter of patient B's blood vessels is increased, allowing for greater blood flow. To elaborate, blood vessels play a crucial role in regulating various body processes, including blood flow and blood pressure. The autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system send signals to control the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. When blood vessels constrict, they become narrower, which can lead to increased blood pressure and reduced flow of blood, potentially affecting the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues. Conversely, when blood vessels dilate or widen, they facilitate better blood flow, thus improving oxygen and nutrient delivery while potentially lowering blood pressure. In this scenario, Greg needs to prescribe medication based on his patients' conditions. For patient A with constricted blood vessels, the appropriate treatment may involve medications that encourage blood vessel dilation or relaxation, such as vasodilators or certain calcium channel blockers. This would increase blood flow and potentially alleviate constriction-related issues. For patient B, who has dilated blood vessels, treatment may depend on the underlying cause of the dilation. If the dilation is causing low blood pressure or other medical concerns, medications that promote vasoconstriction or increase blood pressure, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists or pressors, might be required. However, it is essential for Greg to carefully assess the patients' overall health and medical history before prescribing any medications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ryan Zinke to lead the Interior Department, according to a transition official, tapping a freshman Republican congressman who, like the president-elect, is often at odds with environmentalists but has opposed efforts to sell federal lands to states.      If confirmed by the Senate, the former U.S. Navy SEAL would lead Mr. Trump’s efforts to open federal lands and waters to fossil-fuel development and reverse environmental policies the Obama administration has pursued over the past... ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has offered Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke the job of interior secretary, though it's unclear whether the congressman has accepted, two people with knowledge of the offer said Tuesday.      Zinke, 55, is a retired Navy SEAL who was awarded two Bronze Stars for combat missions in Iraq. He was an early supporter of Trump and met with the president-elect Monday at Trump Tower in Manhattan.      He just won re-election to a second term as Montana's only House member, and Republicans had mentioned him as a possible challenger to two-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018.      Trump was also said to be considering Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers for the job. She wrote on Facebook Tuesday that it was an \\"honor\\" to be invited to meet with Trump.      The people with knowledge of the offer to Zinke insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the transition process publicly.      Zinke, who serves on House Natural Resources and Armed Services committees, describes himself as \\"a steadfast advocate for Montana veterans and military personnel and families.\\" He advocates greater use of public lands for energy production such as oil and natural gas.      Zinke has prioritized development of oil, gas and other resources on public lands and has advocated for state control of energy development on federal lands, a stance that some environmental groups say threatens national parks. Zinke has voted against efforts to designate new national parks that would diversify the National Park System.      Zinke attracted attention in the 2014 campaign for calling Hillary Clinton \\"the antichrist.\\"      \\"Do I really believe that she is the antichrist? That answer would be 'no,'\\" Zinke said in an interview with The Associated Press. \\"But I do get a little emotional about Benghazi, and I like the rest of America want answers.\\"      In September 2012, when Clinton was secretary of state, the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in the eastern city of Benghazi when militants stormed a U.S. diplomatic post and, hours later, fired on a CIA compound nearby. Some Republicans argue the U.S. military held back assets that could have saved lives and believe President Barack Obama and Clinton lied to the public about the nature of the attack.      Before being elected to Congress, Zinke served in the Montana State Senate, where he chaired the Education Committee and focused on advancing technology in the classroom, rural access to education and local control over schools.      Zinke graduated from the University of Oregon, where he played football and earned a degree in geology. He has master's degrees in business finance and global leadership from the University of San Diego.      Interior manages the nation's public lands and minerals and is the steward of 20 percent of the nation's lands, including national parks, national wildlife refuges and other public lands. The department also supplies and manages water in the 17 Western states and upholds federal trust responsibilities to 566 federally recognized Indian tribes and Alaska Natives.      Zinke has raised doubts about climate change as \\"unsettled science.\\" Yet he's also said in interviews that \\"something's going on\\" with the climate and promoted an energy strategy that includes renewable sources such as wind and solar would be prudent.      His home state boasts the largest coal reserves in the nation, although it trails far behind neighboring Wyoming in mining productivity. Zinke was one of many Western Republicans who criticized the Obama administration's imposition of a January moratorium on new coal sales from public lands.      During his re-election campaign, Democrats attempted to label Zinke as a radical conservative who would sell off federal lands to private interests or transfer them to state control. Zinke adamantly denied the charge, which was based on a pledge Democrats alleged he had signed in 2012 stating that Montana's lands were sovereign and not subject to federal control.      Zinke has said he doesn't remember signing the pledge.      He has instead cast himself as a protector of the public's right to access public lands and made a priority in Congress of trying to fix problems with the management of the nation's forests.      During his re-election campaign, he focused largely on national security issues and the need to more thoroughly vet refugees, arguing that terrorism was threatening the homeland and that his more than two decades as a SEAL gave him an advantage on the issue.      ___      Associated Press writers Matthew Daly in Washington and Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump has chosen first-term Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, a former Navy SEAL commander, as his interior secretary, a senior transition official said on Tuesday.      U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke (R-MT) arrives for a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., December 12, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid      Zinke, 55, will be nominated to head the Interior Department, which employs more than 70,000 people across the United States and oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite.      Zinke’s choice was something of a surprise since some Republican officials wanted him to challenge Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana in the 2018 elections.      Zinke emerged after Trump had toyed with the idea of nominating U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state for the position.      He is a proponent of keeping public lands under federal ownership, putting him at odds with some in his Republican Party who are more favorable to privatization or placing them under the control of states.      It remains unclear where Zinke would stand on opening up more federal lands to increased drilling and mining, something Trump promised he would do as president.      Trump’s official energy platform calls for opening “onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminate moratorium on coal leasing, and open shale energy deposits.”      A Trump aide told Reuters last week that McMorris Rodgers had been picked for the post. She had met Trump at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, shortly after the president-elect began his Cabinet search.      On Tuesday, a source close to the congresswoman said she had never been offered the job.      “It was an honor to be invited to spend time with the president-elect, and I’m energized more than ever to continue leading in Congress as we think big, reimagine this government, and put people back at the center of it,” McMorris Rodgers said in a Facebook post.      Zinke had been an early Trump supporter, backing the New York businessman for president in May. His nomination must now be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.      “Congressman Zinke is a strong advocate for American energy independence, and he supports an all-encompassing energy policy that includes renewables, fossil fuels and alternative energy,” Trump spokesman Jason Miller said before a meeting on Monday between Zinke and Trump at Trump Tower in New York.      Zinke, a member of the House of Representatives subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public land.      But, unlike other candidates who were on the short list for the interior secretary job, Zinke opposes the transfer of public lands to the states, a position that echoes Trump’s.      PUBLIC LANDS      Trump has said he does not think public land should be turned over to the states and should be protected.      “I don’t like the idea because I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do,” Trump said in an interview with Field & Stream magazine in January.      Trump said putting states in control of public land would make it easier to sell it off for energy or commercial development. He thinks the federal government needs to focus on conservation.      “I mean, are they going to sell (states) if they get into a little bit of trouble? I don’t think it’s something that should be sold,” he said. “We have to be great stewards of this land. This is magnificent land.”      In July, Zinke resigned as a delegate to the Republican nominating convention because the party platform called for transferring public lands to the states.      “What I saw was a platform that was more divisive than uniting,” Zinke told the Billings Gazette. “At this point, I think it’s better to show leadership.”      Public land comprises more than 30 percent of Montana, according to the Montana Wilderness Association.      The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent.      The Wilderness Society, a leading conservation group, said it was concerned by Zinke’s support for logging, drilling and mining on public lands.      The Interior Department also oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs and handles tribal policy.      Under Obama, the department played a big role in efforts to curb the effects of climate change by limiting fossil fuel development in some areas. ||||| Summary:","output":"President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Montana Republican representative Ryan Zinke as his interior secretary.

American Apparel Inc., the made-in-the-U.S.A. clothing chain known for provocative marketing and boardroom drama, filed for bankruptcy protection after years of losses and a feud with controversial founder Dov Charney.      As part of a prearranged Chapter 11 restructuring, the Los Angeles-based company will reorganize its debts, which have ballooned to levels exceeding its assets. More than 200 million of bonds will be exchanged for stock in the reorganized company, according to a statement on Monday. American Apparel will remain in business during the process.      Filing for bankruptcy is a “difficult decision that gives American Apparel the opportunity to rebuild the business,” said Bryan Roberts, an analyst with Kantar Retail. “Quite a few U.S. retailers have gone down this route and come out the other side.”      Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter. The move follows a clash between Charney and the board that led to his ouster last year for alleged misconduct -- claims he says are baseless -- but American Apparel’s financial woes stretch back longer. The chain has posted deficits every year since 2010. Chronic losses strained its balance sheet to the point that, as of end of June, American Apparel had 161 million more liabilities than assets, meaning the company had a negative book value.      An American Apparel retail store in Washington, DC. Photographer: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images      Sufficient Financing      As part of the bankruptcy agreement, American Apparel will have access to financing after the restructuring, according to the statement. The debt reorganization may last about six months.      Under the accord, creditors will supply enough financing and new capital to fund continuing operations and reduce American Apparel’s debt to no more than 135 million from 300 million. That will help lower annual interest expenses by 20 million, the company said. The plan was supported by 95 percent of secured lenders.      “By improving our financial footing, we will be able to refocus our business efforts on the execution of our turnaround strategy,” Chief Executive Officer Paula Schneider said in the statement. The company plans to create new products, introduce new design initiatives, invest in new stores and expand its e-commerce business, she said.      American Apparel expects to pay all its suppliers in full, and its international operations aren’t affected by the bankruptcy. The restructuring plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and must meet other certain conditions, it said.      Shares Peaked      The company, which began trading publicly in 2007, peaked at 16.80 in December of that year. The shares closed at 11 cents on Friday.      Dov Charney, former chairman and chief executive officer of American Apparel Inc., stands for a portrait in a company retail store in New York in 2010. Photographer: Keith Bedford/Bloomberg      In court papers, the company listed 199.3 million in assets and 397.5 million in debt.      Among its largest unsecured creditors listed in court papers were lender Standard General LP of New York, owed 15 million, and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, owed 3.83 million.      Charney fought to get his job back and teamed up with Standard General to build up his stake in the company. He later said the investment firm betrayed him. Standard General had pledged to help restore his position in American Apparel but instead he was terminated, the ex-CEO said in a Bloomberg Television interview last December. Charney also said at the time that he had only 100,000 to his name.      Sales Decline      A Montreal native, Charney started American Apparel in 1989 during his freshman year at Tufts University in Massachusetts. He never graduated, setting off instead for South Carolina, where he employed 20 women to make T-shirts in a barn with no air conditioning. Ten years later he moved the company to Los Angeles, where there was greater manufacturing capacity.      The company designs and makes “basic fashion” for women, men, children and even pets. It employs about 8,500 people and has about 230 stores worldwide, according to a court filing.      Sales fell in December, a key month for retailers, as Charney said the botched rollout of a new distribution center slowed shipments. The brand also lost favor with some teens and 20-somethings, who shifted to chains such as H&M, Forever 21 and Uniqlo, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a New Canaan, Connecticut-based consulting firm.      In the second quarter, sales sank 17 percent to 134.4 million and the net loss expanded to 19.4 million from 16.2 million, the company said in August.      Young Models      Charney, 46, drew attention for his use of young, scantily clad models in ads for his company’s U.S.-made garments. He also attracted litigation and scrutiny from regulators for his employment practices. A company investigation uncovered a history of misconduct that ranged from mistreatment of employees to misuse of corporate funds, a person familiar with the matter said.      The turbulence at the top means the company has “arguably not had a firm hand on the tiller,” Roberts said.      American Apparel “is the largest apparel manufacturer in North America,” Mark Weinsten, chief restructuring officer, said in a declaration. Its T-shirts bear messages on immigrants’ rights, sweatshop conditions and sexual orientation, among other topics. The company lost more than 30 million between 2009 and 2014, struggling with the need for liquidity, he said.      The case is In re American Apparel Inc., 15-12055, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware.      (Earlier versions of this story were corrected to fix references to Schneider’s gender, Charney’s age and the year the company was founded.) ||||| A 13.9 million interest payment due on Oct. 15 had loomed large on the horizon; as of mid-August, American Apparel had just over 11 million in cash on hand. The shortfall prompted the company itself to warn it may not have enough capital to cover its costs over the next year.      Under the financing agreement, five American Apparel bondholders would convert some 200 million in bonds into equity in the reorganized company. Participating bondholders would also provide 90 million in debtor-in-possession financing, as well as 70 million in new liquidity.      The fresh financing would reduce American Apparel’s debt to 120 million from 311 million, and its annual interest expenses would fall by 24 million, the company said. The participating bondholders are Standard General, Monarch Alternative Capital, Coliseum Capital, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Pentwater Capital Management, all hedge funds or investment firms specializing in distressed debt. Together, they represent 95 percent of the retailer’s secured lenders.      Bankruptcy proceedings would also temporarily delay numerous lawsuits against the company, giving its management some breathing room to get the company’s financial house in order. The retailer had been in the middle of a turnaround plan that included freshening up its product lineup, overhauling its supply chain and reining in American Apparel’s notoriously risqué advertising.      Paula Schneider, a longtime retail executive brought in last year to salvage American Apparel’s ailing operations, is expected to stay on as chief executive through the bankruptcy proceedings.      In an interview on Sunday, Ms. Schneider said that free of its crippling debt and interest payments, American Apparel could finally put that turnaround plan into action. The retailer was able to bring to the store only 15 to 20 percent of its planned lineup for the fall season, because it could not afford to do more, she said.      “Our debt load simply wasn’t sustainable. You can’t do a turnaround plan without cash,” Ms. Schneider said. “Every day, we would make choices on what we were going to buy, even though we needed more for everyone. Every day, I have to pick between what I’m buying for retail or wholesale, or giving e-commerce enough money to develop a mobile app,” she said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"American Apparel Inc., known for its provocative marketing and U.S.-based manufacturing, filed for bankruptcy after years of losses and controversy with founder Dov Charney.

In this case, the country with the most coastline is Canada. Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world, stretching approximately 202,080 kilometers (125,567 miles). This extensive coastline can be attributed to its vast size and numerous islands, as well as its location bordering three major oceans - the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Oceans. The coastline plays a significant role in Canada's economy and diverse ecosystems. The coastal regions are inhabited by various marine species, plants, and endangered animals. Also, fishing, aquaculture, tourism, and international trade are some of the vital economic activities that depend on these natural resources. It is important to note that the measurement of a coastline can be imprecise, as it involves various factors, such as the scale of the map used and the level of detail in considering the inlets and bays. Consequently, different sources may provide slightly varying figures for the length of Canada's coastline. However, it remains widely accepted that Canada has the longest coastline globally.

But a loophole means academies and free schools - which are controlled by central government rather than local authorities - do not have to follow the national curriculum and are not, therefore, obliged to teach the subject. Sex education is also taught at most secondary schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where there are separate education guidelines. Parents can opt to take their children out of these classes. Ms Barron said children were exposed to sexual imagery on a \\"daily basis\\". \\"Children themselves, girls in particular, are telling us that they feel they need improved, age-appropriate mandatory sex and relationships education,\\" she said. \\"This would help them navigate these difficult issues.\\" Plan UK's poll of UK adults, carried out by Opinium, also found that: The findings come amid growing pressure for sex education to be compulsory in schools. The Local Government Association warned that pupils in England's schools were at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections when they reached adulthood, because they were not being properly prepared. Labour has also called for compulsory age-appropriate sex education in all schools in England, claiming that sexting among under-16s is on the rise. Conservative MP Maria Miller, who has also backed a change in policy, added that most children will already have seen online pornography by the time they leave primary school. \\"I want compulsory lessons at school to help children better understand the signs of an abusive relationship, issues such as consent and the harm that is done by sexting and underage viewing of pornography,\\" she said. Last year, a parliamentary inquiry said there were \\"alarming inconsistencies\\" in the way schools deal with sexual harassment and violence. The cross-party Women and Equalities Committee said in its report last September that compulsory sex education would \\"help to significantly reduce the incidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in schools\\".","output":"A recent survey conducted by Plan International UK found that 75% of respondents believe the impact of pornography should be a compulsory part of sex education in schools, whilst 71% said students should receive lessons about sexting. Currently, local authority secondary schools in England are required to teach sex education as part of their science curriculum, but this only includes biological aspects of reproduction, rather than relationships. Academies and free schools, controlled by central government, are not obliged to teach sex education. The issue is currently under consideration by Education Secretary Justine Greening, but no law change has yet been proposed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Build out your options with items that reflect your personal style. After you have some staples you can begin to add with more clothing and accessories that fit your style. Don’t waste money or time on items that you don’t like and donate your old clothes when you get new ones.  If you like a more preppy look, and wear more button-downs, add a tie to your wardrobe. While a clean pair of sneakers is great for pairing with sweaters, button-downs, and even a blazer, consider ditching your old dirty pair. Or, upgrade your shoes to casual leather loafers or a pair of brown dress shoes. If you’re always running late to class it might be time to accessorize with a watch. Not only will it keep you punctual, but it adds a bit of class to your look. Dressing classy as a college guy means putting in the effort to look put together, even at that 8:00 am class. Sweatpants and a zipped-up hoodie should be worn at home or the gym.  If you love your sweats or the athletic look, you can class it up with little effort. Invest in a pair of joggers or slim structured sweatpants which taper around the ankle. Swap your worn out zip-up hoodie for a solid-colored crew neck sweatshirt or sweater. You can also play with layers. Wear your sweatshirt over a collared shirt. Dressing well will make you feel good, keep your mind sharp, and give you confidence. So dress for the job you want to give you a head start.  If you plan on going into a career that is more traditional you will probably be wearing a suit or an outfit that’s close at the office. Invest in a suit and some dress shirts. Being prepared will not only help you think like a man with the job but could benefit you with potential interviews and even your professors. Shower before class and think about how your professors see you. When it’s time to start networking and looking for work these are some people who you may need help from. Wearing a polo instead of a t-shirt and nice jeans or chinos instead of sweats shows you’re responsible and respectful. You can really class up your style with two leather belts. You don’t need to spend a lot of money either, but one brown and one black leather belt should be all you need.   Depending on your personal style, feel free to get more belts that go well with a certain season or occasion. A colored leather belt can be a statement piece when you’re going for a casual look. Formal belts should be about 2.5 – 3.5cm wide and be understated and match your shoes. Planning what you’ll wear the next day will not only help you prepare to look your best, but it will give you a sense of anything missing from your wardrobe.  Before going to bed pick out your outfit for the next day. Remember to match your belt to your shoes. Add layers when you can. Planning out your outfit will help you to look put together. You won’t have to worry about it when you wake up in the morning.

This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” How long did it take the author to fully recover from the surgical mishap?  A. not enough information  B.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut...

Transcript: The Bulls And The Bears Steve Forbes: What are some of the specific characteristics you look for in value investing? Do you try to size up a management? Do you look at cash flows? What kind of metrics do you use that you find particularly helpful? EBIT I don't think is one of them. Jean-Marie Eveillard (Senior Adviser, First Eagle Funds): No, it is not one of them. Although we are partial in terms of valuations to enterprise value to EBIT, because enterprise value introduces a balance sheet, which price-earnings ratio does not. And EBIT admittedly--earnings before interest and taxes--interest and taxes have to be paid, but to the extent that not always, but most of the time, we buy the stocks of companies that are financially safe, as Marty Whitman puts is, and where there is very little or no debt, then there is no interest expense. And as far as taxes go, I've always been somewhat suspicious--well, except in countries such as Hong Kong, where the corporate rate, your official corporate rate is very low. Otherwise, I'd be somewhat suspicious of companies where the tax rate is lowered. I figure that either they're cheating the tax authorities and maybe the authorities would catch up with them, or they're overstating their profits. Follow Intelligent Investing On Twitter. Sign Up For The Daily Intelligent Investing Newsletter. Forbes: A lot of managers call themselves value investors. How do you distinguish yourself in terms of picking securities? Bruce Berkowitz (Founder, CIO & COO, Fairholme Capital Management): Well the one key characteristic is cash. We basically count the cash that a company generates because, after all, what else can you spend? And frankly, I mean, investing, whether you call it value investing, whatever type of investing, is all about comparing what you give vs. what you're gonna get over time. So you give the cash to purchase the investment and then it's our job to estimate how much that investment's going to pay us back over time in cash. Forbes: So you're looking for distressed merchandise that has a huge cash flow. Berkowitz: That's what we're looking for, free cash flow. I think Benjamin Graham called that \\"owner earnings.\\" Yes, what can be given to the owners of the company. I know that's a concept a lot of people aren't using these days, especially management. But yes, we're looking to see what the shareholders will receive over time. Forbes: So how would you describe your investment approach? You have several newsletters. You've got a new mutual fund. Do you have various classes, various approaches, or what's your brand? Tom Gardner (Co-Founder & CEO, The Motley Fool): Well, I think probably more than anything else, it's fundamental analysis. We're not interested in stock price movements over a weekly or quarterly basis. We're really looking at the business and trying to evaluate it. We probably spend more time on the strength of the business than the value of the stock, although both are obviously quite important. And we have a number of different approaches at The Motley Fool. I mean, for example, my brother is a little bit more of a VC-type investor. He's happy to have six or seven disappointments in order to have a company like Marvel Entertainment ( MVL - news - people ) show up in his portfolio and go up 15 times in value. I, on the other hand, like to look at the stock market as an auction market. I like to look for unknown companies that aren't very closely followed. An investor that I really admire, Walter Schloss, did a similar thing. Just going out and seeing merchandise that nobody is paying attention to, bidding on it when there aren't many bidders and letting the company succeed over a number of years. So I spend a lot of time looking at the ownership, how much stock is owned by the CEO, how long has he or she been with the business, and I think we, right now, live in a marketplace where there's such a short-term focus, even after what's happened. And I think if people learned to look at businesses over 10, 15, 20 years, they'd find people like Jim Sinegal at Costco Wholesale ( COST - news - people ). They'd find the Walton family at Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT - news - people ). They'd find Buffett at Berkshire, Gates at Microsoft ( MSFT - news - people ), Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com ( AMZN - news - people ). People who give their life to their company is what I'm looking for, not public companies that have a new CEO every three to five years.

You can find resources online, in your local library, or in your local bookstore. Let them know that you’re there for them and want to them to take the time to get better. In some cases, they may be managing or dealing with their symptoms throughout their entire life, with frequent relapses. Let them know that you will be there for them.  Talk to their doctor and/or social worker, when appropriate. Tell your loved one that you’d like to help with their treatment plan, if they feel comfortable. You could say, “I love you and want you to feel better. If you feel comfortable, I’m happy to read over your treatment plan and help in any way I can.” It will likely be necessary for you to confront issues at times. When you must address a problem, always frame it using “I” rather than “you” statements. This makes your comments about you, not them.  For example, “I feel threatened when you throw things in frustration. I would feel safer if you worked with your therapist to reduce those urges.” Don’t say, “You always throw stuff and scare me! You need to stop!” Many patients spend their whole lives managing their illness. Even with treatment, they may still experience symptoms. Don’t push them to “act normal” or take on responsibilities. This could cause conflict in the relationship, lead to a setback or worse, both. Sharing your experiences with people in a similar situation can help you cope better. Not only will they listen to you, they may also have helpful advice. You may also be able to learn more about your loved one's condition.  Ask the doctor or treatment facility for a recommendation.

We have this equation: 868*x + 104 = 855*x Our goal is to find the value of x, which we do by getting x all by itself on one side of the equation. Here's what we'll do: 1. Subtract 855*x from both sides of the equation:    868*x - 855*x + 104 = 855*x - 855*x 2. Simplify the equation:    (868-855)*x + 104 = 0    13*x + 104 = 0 3. Now we need to get rid of the 104 that's being added to 13*x. So, we'll subtract 104 from both sides:    13*x = -104 4. Lastly, we need to find the value of x by dividing -104 by 13:    x = -104 / 13 5. After doing the division, we get:    x = -8 So, x equals -8!

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.  Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A?  Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. The answer to this question is:","output":"Era B, the period with decreased rainfall, would likely see less rocks with chemical reactions than Era A, which experienced substantially more rainfall. To understand the reasons behind this, it's essential to examine the difference in circumstances between the two eras. In Era A, the Sahara Desert received an ample amount of rainfall, leading to increased rates of weathering. The rainwater helped break down rocks by reacting chemically with the rock material and facilitating the dissolution of certain minerals. Moreover, as more rainwater permeated through the soil, the top layers experienced heightened chemical reactions. The high rainfall during Era A also supported a continuous process of material erosion, leading to new surfaces being exposed. This, in turn, boosted the overall rate of weathering, which is the breakdown of rocks influenced by factors such as water, wind, and temperature changes. As a result, Era A would have had a significantly higher number of rocks experiencing chemical reactions due to the higher rainfall and the consequent weathering. In contrast, Era B saw a reduction in rainfall across the Sahara region. With less rain and moisture available, the rates of chemical reactions and weathering experienced by rocks would also decrease. As less water passed through the soil, the top layers did not undergo as many chemical reactions as they did during Era A. Additionally, the decrease in rainfall would lead to less material being carried away, resulting in fewer newly exposed surfaces. Consequently, Era B would have a lesser number of rocks experiencing chemical reactions compared to Era A. In the context of the emergence of the Egyptian civilization, the transition from Era A to Era B had a significant impact on the region's landscape and environmental conditions. As rainfall decreased, the previously lush and green Sahara Desert transformed into a more arid environment. The shift might have pushed human populations toward the Nile River, searching for reliable water sources and fertile land for agriculture. This movement could have facilitated the establishment and development of highly organized agrarian communities, which eventually led to the emergence of the Egyptian civilization. In conclusion, the decreased rainfall during Era B would have resulted in fewer rocks experiencing chemical reactions compared to the high-rainfall Era A. This change in weather patterns and environmental conditions significantly impacted the region's landscape and possibly influenced the development and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization."},{"instruction":"-  The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different.

Given the question: Information:  - The Southern United States, commonly referred to as the American South, Dixie, or simply the South, is a region of the United States of America. The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations. However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South.  - KZZL - FM ( 99.5 FM ) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format . Licensed to Pullman , Washington , USA , the station is currently owned by Inland Northwest Broadcasting , LLC and features programming from Premiere Radio Networks and Dial Global .  - The banjo is a four-, five- or six-stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity as a resonator, called the head. The membrane, or head, is typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally but rarely used, and the frame is typically circular. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by Africans in America, adapted from African instruments of similar design.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.  - Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. While the Appalachian Mountains stretch from Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador) in Canada to Cheaha Mountain in Alabama, the cultural region of Appalachia typically refers only to the central and southern portions of the range. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region was home to approximately 25 million people.  - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions.  - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.  - Hillbilly is a term (often derogatory) for people who dwell in rural, mountainous areas in the United States, primarily in Appalachia and the Ozarks, Uwharrie Mountains, and Caraway Mountains. Due to its strongly stereotypical connotations, the term can be offensive to those Americans of Appalachian or Ozark heritage. The first known instances of \\"Hillbilly\\" in print were in \\"The Railroad Trainmen's Journal\\" (vol. ix, July 1892), a 1899 photograph of men and women in West Virginia labeled \\"Camp Hillbilly\\" andin a 1900 \\"New York Journal\\" article, with the definition: \\"a Hill-Billie is a free and untrammeled white citizen of Tennessee, who lives in the hills, has no means to speak of, dresses as he can, talks as he pleases, drinks whiskey when he gets it, and fires off his revolver as the fancy takes him\\". The stereotype is twofold in that it incorporates both positive and negative traits: \\"Hillbillies\\" are often considered independent and self-reliant individuals who resist the modernization of society, but at the same time they are also defined as backward and violent. Scholars argue this duality is reflective of the split ethnic identities in white America.  - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world.  - The Palouse is a region of the northwestern United States, encompassing parts of southeastern Washington, north central Idaho and, by some definitions, parts of northeast Oregon. It is a major agricultural area, primarily producing wheat and legumes. Situated about north of the Oregon Trail, the region experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century and was once Washington's most populous region, surpassing even the Puget Sound area.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acousticallyby transmitting the vibration of the strings to the airas opposed to relying on electronic amplification (see electric guitar). The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body, creating sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen the vibrations of the strings.  - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.  - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - Pullman is the largest city in Whitman County, located in southeastern Washington state within the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest. The population was 29,799 at the 2010 census, estimated to have reached 31,682 in 2014. Originally incorporated as Three Forks, the city was later renamed after industrialist George Pullman.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Indigenous languages of the Americas are spoken by indigenous peoples from Alaska and Greenland to the southern tip of South America, encompassing the land masses that constitute the Americas. These indigenous languages consist of dozens of distinct language families, as well as many language isolates and unclassified languages. Many proposals to group these into higher-level families have been made, such as Joseph Greenberg's Amerind hypothesis. This scheme is rejected by nearly all specialists, due to the fact that some of the languages differ too significantly to draw any connections between them. Thousands of languages were spoken by various peoples in North and South America prior to their first contact with Europeans. These encounters occurred between the beginning of the 11th century (with the Nordic settlement of Greenland and failed efforts in Newfoundland and Labrador) and the end of the 15th century (the voyages of Christopher Columbus). Several indigenous cultures of the Americas had also developed their own writing systems, the best known being the Maya script. The indigenous languages of the Americas had widely varying demographics, from the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guarani, and Nahuatl, which had millions of active speakers, to many languages with only several hundred speakers. After pre-Columbian times, several indigenous creole languages developed in the Americas, based on European, indigenous and African languages.  The European colonizers and their successor states had widely varying attitudes towards Native American languages. In Brazil, friars learned and promoted the Tupi language. In many Latin American colonies, Spanish missionaries often learned local languages and culture in order to preach to the natives in their own tongue and relate the Christian message to their indigenous religions. In the British American colonies, John Eliot of the Massachusetts Bay Colony translated the Bible into the Massachusett language, also called Wampanoag, or Natick (1661-1663; he published the first Bible printed in North America, the Eliot Indian Bible.  The Europeans also suppressed use of indigenous American languages, establishing their own languages for official communications, destroying texts in other languages, and insisting that indigenous people learn European languages in schools. As a result, indigenous American languages suffered from cultural suppression and loss of speakers. By the 18th and 19th centuries, Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and Dutch, brought to the Americas by European settlers and administrators, had become the official or national languages of modern nation-states of the Americas.  Many indigenous languages have become critically endangered, but others are vigorous and part of daily life for millions of people. Several indigenous languages have been given official status in the countries where they occur, such as Guarani in Paraguay. In other cases official status is limited to certain regions where the languages are most spoken. Although sometimes enshrined in constitutions as official, the languages may be used infrequently in de facto official use. Examples are Quechua in Peru and Aymara in Bolivia, where in practice, Spanish is dominant in all formal contexts.  In North America and the Arctic region, Greenland in 2009 adopted Kalaallisut as its sole official language. In the United States, the Navajo language is the most spoken Native American language, with more than 200,000 speakers in the Southwestern United States. The US Marine Corps recruited Navajo men, who were established as code talkers during World War II, to transmit secret US military messages. Neither the Germans nor Japanese ever deciphered the Navajo code, which was a code using the Navajo language. Today, governments, universities, and indigenous peoples are continuing to work for the preservation and revitalization of indigenous American languages.

Movie title: Alphaville Movie plot: Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from \\"the Outlands\\". Entering Alphaville in his Ford Mustang,[3] called a Ford Galaxie,[4] he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson, and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda. He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society. Caution is told that men are killed at a ratio of fifty to every one woman executed. He also learns that Swedes, Germans and Americans assimilate well with Alphaville. Images of the EÂ =Â mcÂ² and E = hf equations are displayed several times throughout the film as symbols of the regime of logical science that rules Alphaville.

He was initially placed under house arrest at his home in Islamabad but later transferred to the police headquarters in the city. Mr Musharraf has described the cases against him as politically motivated. Thursday's order to arrest him was an unprecedented move against a former army chief who ruled the country for almost a decade, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says. Although he was present at court  when the warrant was issued, police made no attempt to arrest him and he rapidly returned to his home on the outskirts of the city. He was finally arrested on Friday morning and appeared at court, where a judge ruled that he should be held in custody for two days. The decision to move him from his home to police headquarters appears to be largely procedural. He is expected to appear before an anti-terrorism court in the next 48 hours. His legal team have said they will challenge the order in Pakistan's Supreme Court. Meanwhile,  members of Pakistan's Senate passed a resolution that the former president should be tried on charges of high treason relating to his declaration of a state of emergency in 2007. Last month Mr Musharraf returned from years of self-imposed exile hoping to lead his All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) party into the general election next month. Earlier this week his candidacy was rejected in Chitral, one of four seats he had applied to contest. Mr Musharraf had already failed in an attempt to stand in three other seats. The case for which he has been arrested relates to his controversial decision to dismiss judges - including Chief Justice Mohammad Iftikhar Chaudhry - when he imposed emergency rule in 2007. He also faces several other criminal cases and had been trying to stave off arrest ever since he returned. The Pakistani Taliban have also vowed to assassinate the former president, who seized power in a 1999 coup.

Article: If you hear the sound of a handset beeping  in a bag or pocket, you could be forgiven for thinking that someone has received a text message. But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via  SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps  , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the user usually only has to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Web developers soon _ . Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world.

In keeping with this theme, this article will provide a detailed guide on how to create your own DIY natural toothpaste using just a few simple ingredients. Benefits of Homemade Natural Toothpaste Opting to create your own toothpaste from natural ingredients offers several advantages over store-bought alternatives. Firstly, homemade toothpaste allows you to be in control of the ingredients used, eliminating any potential allergens or irritants. Additionally, DIY toothpaste often contains fewer abrasive elements, resulting in a gentler clean that can be especially beneficial for those with sensitive teeth or gums. Lastly, making your own toothpaste has a lower environmental impact, as it eliminates the consumption of plastic packaging and supports a more sustainable lifestyle. Ingredients To create your own natural toothpaste, gather the following ingredients: 1. 2/3 cup baking soda 2. 1 teaspoon sea salt 3. Essential oil of your choice (peppermint, spearmint, tea tree oil, etc.) 4. Water (amount will vary depending on desired consistency) Step-by-Step Recipe 1. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a medium-sized bowl, combine the 2/3 cup of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive that helps to scrub away plaque, while also neutralizing odors. Sea salt enhances the texture and flavor of the toothpaste and is said to possess natural antibacterial properties. 2. Add Essential Oils: Next, add a few drops of your preferred essential oil into the mixture. Popular choices for toothpaste recipes are peppermint, spearmint, or tea tree oil. These oils not only provide a refreshing taste and aroma, but also contain antibacterial and antifungal properties that promote oral health. Be cautious not to use too much of the essential oil, as they can be potent. Start with approximately 2-3 drops and adjust to taste. 3. Mix in Water: Slowly start mixing water into the dry ingredients, adding small amounts at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. For a thicker toothpaste, use less water; for a thinner, more liquid consistency, add more water. Be sure to mix the ingredients thoroughly as you incorporate the water to ensure a smooth, homogenous paste. 4. Store Toothpaste: Once the toothpaste has reached your preferred consistency, transfer it into a clean glass jar or airtight container. Glass jars are an ideal choice for storage, as they are both reusable and eco-friendly. To avoid contamination, it is important to use a clean utensil or scoop to transfer the toothpaste onto your toothbrush each time you use it. Using Your DIY Natural Toothpaste To use your homemade toothpaste, simply scoop a small amount onto your toothbrush and brush as you would with commercial toothpaste. Keep in mind that this DIY paste will not produce the frothy foam that most store-bought options do, as it lacks the chemical surfactants commonly found in commercial toothpastes. This does not affect its efficacy, however, as the abrasive baking soda and essential oils will still work to clean and freshen your breath. Conclusion Creating your own DIY natural toothpaste is an easy and affordable way to enhance your oral hygiene routine while reducing your exposure to harmful chemicals and supporting a more sustainable lifestyle. With just a few simple ingredients and a bit of experimentation to find the perfect consistency and flavor, you can enjoy the benefits of a cleaner, healthier smile and a greener planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism...

Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

It makes 1.4 million people sick every year. Salmonella is often found in raw eggs and chicken. Cooking kills these bacteria, which is why it is so important to cook eggs, chicken, and other foods thoroughly. But how long does it take these bacteria to pollute food? A team of scientists in South Carolina did an experiment. First, they placed an amount of Salmonella on three surfaces; wood, tile  , and carpet. They placed a piece of bread and a piece of bologna  on each surface for 5,30, or 60 seconds. After just 5 seconds, both the bread and the bologna picked up enough bacteria to make you sick. So forget the 5-second rule. If your toast drops on the floor, throw it away and get another piece of clean toast. This time, be careful not to drop it!

Given the following context:  A middle Saxon pendant dating from 601–700 AD was discovered in a field in Little Thetford in 1952. This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. Æthelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, Æthelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410–1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410–1065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford—Old English lȳtel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)—compare with Thetford, Norfolk—Old English Thēodford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of Ælfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \\"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church.

Although each trip is different, there are universal things you can do to keep safe.               Be prepared.  \\"Schedule a visit with a doctor who specializes in travel or the area you're visiting at least four weeks before your departure,\\" says WHO public health expert Dr. Gilles Poumerol. A travel doctor will be able to give you the required and recommended vaccinations  as well as discuss any medical issues you may come across abroad.               Get insurance.  \\"In many countries where you have limited access to health care, good health care is only found in the private sector and can be very expensive,\\" Dr. Poumerol says. Plus, in an emergency, returning to the United States can cost more than 50,000. Ask your health insurance company whether your policy applies overseas and whether it will cover trips to a foreign hospital. If not, there are many companies that offer short-term travel health insurance for a reasonable fee. A list can be found on the US State Department's travel website. Ks5u                 Pack well.  Dr. Poumerol also suggests bringing a note from your doctor in English and the language of the country you're visiting. Packing an emergency contact list is important. Contacts should include the local embassy ,  s who should be informed if you get sick and your health insurance company.               Be care.  You have to be in charge of your health.

Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Daniel Sturridge is out of Liverpool’s biggest week of the season as he continues his recovery from a calf problem. Liverpool face a trip to Newcastle on Saturday before heading to Spain for a Champions League clash against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and round off a demanding seven days with a showdown against Chelsea at Anfield. Sturridge, who has not played for his club since August 31, 11 matches ago, damaged his calf two weeks ago in training as he was working his way back from a thigh injury. Brendan Rodgers has confirmed Daniel Sturridge will miss Liverpool's match against Newcastle. Sturridge picked up his latest injury on England duty and hasn't played since the beginning of September. Daniel Sturridge went on Twitter on Thursday to reveal he his feeling 'closer to full fitness' Crunch matches he will miss. Newcastle (a) - November 1. Real Madrid (a) - November 4. Chelsea (h) - November 8. England vs Slovenia - November 12. Scotland v England - November 15. Liverpool initially hoped he might recover within a fortnight but there is no prospect of that and Rodgers has reluctantly accepted that time has run out. ‘I don’t think he will be fit,’ said Rodgers. ‘The bottom line is that he is injured. He strained his calf. So he is injured. We will just wait and work with him until he gets back fit. ‘I have to find the solutions without Daniel. You are learning every day about the players. Gradually as each day goes by, I sense and feel we are getting better.’ The ramifications of Sturridge’s absence from those matches is that he will not be available for England’s games against Slovenia and Scotland next month, either. The England striker tweeted that he is getting 'closer to fitness each day' but will be out of a crucial week. Sturridge signs autographs before Liverpool's Capital One Cup game against Swansea on Tuesday. His absence has come as a source of great frustration to his manager, as the 25-year-old’s pace, clinical finishing and dynamism are crucial to Liverpool’s gameplan and they have certainly missed him. Rodgers would not be drawn on Sturridge’s claim on talkSPORT that his fitness problems might be ‘hereditary’ as both his father (Simon) and uncle (Dean) endured muscular injuries like him, but the manager wants to see his striker have a consistent run in his team. ‘When you have that talent, you just have to keep yourself fit and available as you possibly can,’ said Rodgers. Rodgers would not be drawn on Sturridge's claims that his fitness problems might be 'hereditary' ‘We will work with him and hopefully we will get that bit of luck when he comes back. When he comes back, hopefully we will have him for the rest of the season. ‘I can only concentrate on his injury now. He’s just recovering and we will see the length of time it takes. He is probably speaking how he felt. That is the way of the world. ‘I am not an expert on any genetics code, or medicine, so I can’t comment. ‘All I know is it’s a calf strain on the back of his last injury and he’s working to recover.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Liverpool Manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Daniel Sturridge will miss Liverpool's important matches against Newcastle, Real Madrid, and Chelsea due to his ongoing recovery from a calf injury.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower.

He was a very skilled player but sometimes got into trouble. The important people who took care of the team in Milan, like a man named Umberto Gandini, thought it was time for Mario to find a new home and try something new. So, Mario packed his bags and left Milan to join a new team called Liverpool in a faraway place called England. This was a big change for Mario, and he was excited to start a new chapter in his life and try his best to play soccer for his new team. Mario's start at Liverpool was not as smooth as he hoped. In his first eight games, he only managed to score one goal. He was also asked to sit on the bench and not play a few times too. But, Mario is still young at only 24 years old, and he has lots of time to learn, grow, and become a better soccer player. His old friends from Milan, like Umberto Gandini, thought that Mario was not ready yet to be the main soccer player who can carry the club team to win many games. They knew that he needed more time to learn and get better. In the end, Mario Balotelli's journey from Milan to Liverpool is all about finding a new start and a chance to grow.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles more?  Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all.  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"Usain will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles more.  Justification:  The paragraph indicates that Usain, although a former competitive swimmer, has decided to take up running frequently. The hint provided states clearly that exercises such as running lead to a faster contraction of the cardiac muscles and the heart pumping more blood. Using the cardiac muscle in this manner increases its strength and efficiency.  On the other hand, Asafa, Usain's brother, does not engage much in running, which in turn implies that he is not contributing much to the strength and efficiency of his cardiac muscles. With the principle of \\"use it or lose it\\" in mind, it can be deducted that Usain, with his frequent running, will be boosting the strength of his cardiac muscles more than Asafa who hardly runs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: Sue Ogrocki, AP)      Publicity surrounding the Affordable Care Act's benefits may be meeting supporters' goals. More people view the health law favorably than at any point in nearly seven years.      That's the main finding of a Kaiser Family Foundation survey out Friday of 1,160 people last week that shows the Affordable Care Act is as popular as it's been since the summer of 2010.      The percent of people with favorable views of the law increased from 43% in December to 48% now. People are still split on whether to repeal the law or not — though far fewer want repeal without details of a replacement plan.      \\"It’s not surprising that as Democrats have gone on the offense about the benefits of the law for people, support for the law has gone up,\\" says Paul Howard, director of health policy at the free market Manhattan Institute.      More than 1,160 adults were polled Feb. 13-19 for the survey,which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.      A lack of clarity over what the law would be replaced with if repealed strengthens attachment to the ACA, says Howard. Republican infighting weakens support for the repeal effort and supporters of the law have made \\"effective use of town halls\\" in congressional districts, he added.      \\"The devil you know is more popular than the devil you don't,\\" says Howard.      Liz Hamel is director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Photo: Kaiser Family Foundation)      While Democrats and Republicans' opinions of the law haven't changed much, independents seem to have grown more positive about the ACA, says Liz Hamel, Kaiser Family Foundation's director of public opinion and survey research.      \\"They're most likely reacting to what they’re hearing in the news and the fact that more of the public discussion of late is about what people stand to lose if it is repealed,\\" says Hamel.      The new findings come as insurers and consumers are trying to figure out what to make of Internal Revenue Service guidance on how it would treat tax returns that that appeared to suggest taxpayers without health insurance won’t face penalties at tax time.      In recent years, returns that didn't indicate whether the taxpayer had insurance or an exemption were processed, but that was set to change this year. Based on one of President Trump's executive orders, the IRS now plans to continue processing these returns and may follow up at a future date.      Read more:      \\"Legislative provisions of the ACA law are still in force until changed by the Congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe‎,\\" the IRS said.      The insurance industry trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans, is urging Congress to approve other incentives to keep people enrolled in insurance if the tax penalties are eliminated. If people aren't required to buy insurance, healthy people are more likely to wait to buy it when they are sick or injured and their premiums couldn't offset the costs of insuring those who need more health care.      Other findings:      • Nearly half of the public worry someone in their family will lose coverage if the ACA is repealed and replaced.      • Substantial majorities say it is important that any ACA replacement plan continue to provide federal funds to states that expanded Medicaid under the law. This was true no matter where people lived or what political party they belong to.      • About two thirds of people prefers status quo over such changes that would limit federal spending while giving states more flexibility to decide who and what to cover.      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2meTvNc ||||| House Speaker Paul Ryan promised that Republicans would begin marking up a repeal bill next week. | Getty Exclusive: Leaked GOP Obamacare replacement shrinks subsidies, Medicaid expansion The replacement would be paid for by limiting tax breaks on generous health plans people get at work.      A draft House Republican repeal bill would dismantle the Obamacare subsidies and scrap its Medicaid expansion, according to a copy of the proposal obtained by POLITICO.      The legislation would take down the foundation of Obamacare, including the unpopular individual mandate, subsidies based on people’s income, and all of the law’s taxes. It would significantly roll back Medicaid spending and give states money to create high risk pools for some people with pre-existing conditions. Some elements would be effective right away; others not until 2020.      Story Continued Below      The replacement would be paid for by limiting tax breaks on generous health plans people get at work — an idea that is similar to the Obamacare “Cadillac tax” that Republicans have fought to repeal.      Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that Republicans would introduce repeal legislation after recess. But the GOP has been deeply divided about how much of the law to scrap, and how much to “repair,” and the heated town halls back home during the weeklong recess aren’t making it any easier for them.      The key House committees declined to comment on specifics of a draft that will change as the bill moves through the committees. The speaker's office deferred to the House committees.      In place of the Obamacare subsidies, the House bill starting in 2020 would give tax credits — based on age instead of income. For a person under age 30, the credit would be 2,000. That amount would double for beneficiaries over the age of 60, according to the proposal. A related document notes that HHS Secretary Tom Price wants the subsidies to be slightly less generous for most age groups.      The Republican plan would also eliminate Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion in 2020. States could still cover those people if they chose but they’d get a lot less federal money to do so. And instead of the current open-ended federal entitlement, states would get capped payments to states based on the number of Medicaid enrollees.      Another key piece of the Republican proposal: 100 billion in “state innovation grants” to help subsidize extremely expensive enrollees. That aims to address at least a portion of the “pre-existing condition” population, though without the same broad protections as in the Affordable Care Act.      It also would eliminate Planned Parenthood funding, which could be an obstacle if the bill gets to the Senate. And it leaves decisions about mandatory or essential benefits to the states.      According to the document, there’s only one single revenue generator to pay for the new tax credits and grants. Republicans are proposing to cap the tax exemption for employer sponsored insurance at the 90th percentile of current premiums. That means benefits above that level would be taxed.      And while health care economists on both sides of the aisle favor tax-limits along those lines, politically it’s a hard sell. Both businesses and unions fought the Obamacare counterpart, dubbed the Cadillac tax.      The document is more detailed than the general powerpoint House leaders circulated before the recess. Lawmakers are still in disagreement about several key issues, including Medicaid and the size and form of subsidies. Discussions within the House, and between House leaders and the White House about the final proposal are ongoing. President Donald Trump, who gives a major speech to Congress on Tuesday night, has said he expects a plan will emerge in early to mid March.      The exact details of any legislation will also be shaped by findings from the CBO about how much it will cost and what it will do to the federal deficit.      But the draft shows that Republicans are sticking closely to previous plans floated by Ryan and Price in crafting their Obamacare repeal package.      “Obamacare has failed,\\" said HHS spokesperson Caitlin Oakley. \\"We welcome any and all efforts to repeal and replace it with real solutions that put patients first and back in charge of their health care rather than government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.”      Other changes proposed by Republicans align with previous ideas for strengthening the individual insurance market, which has been unstable under Obamacare with rising premiums and dwindling competition. For example, the legislation would allow insurers to charge older customers up to five times as much as their younger counterparts. Currently, they can only charge them three times as much in premiums. The insurers have been pushing for that change.      The proposal also includes penalties for individuals who fail to maintain coverage continuously. If their coverage lapses and they decide to re-enroll, they would have to pay a 30 percent boost in premiums for a year. Like the unpopular individual mandate, that penalty is designed to discourage individuals from waiting until they get sick to get coverage.      Republicans have vowed to dismantle Obamacare ever since it passed with only Democratic votes in 2010. But reaching agreement on what should come next has proven difficult since they gained full control of Congress and the White House.      Recent polling has shown that Obamacare is increasingly popular. Supporters of the health care law have been turning out by the hundreds at town hall meetings across the country to demand that Republicans answer questions about what’s going to happen to the 20 million individual who have gained coverage under Obamacare.      According to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, released Friday morning, the public now views the Affordable Care Act more favorably than it has since the summer of its enactment. Some 48 percent view the law favorably — up from 43 percent in December. About 42 percent have an unfavorable view of the ACA — down from 46 percent in December. The pollsters say Independents are mostly responsible for the shift. A separate poll by the Pew Research Center found 54 percent approve of the health care law — the highest scores for Obamacare in the poll's history. Meanwhile, 43 percent said they disapprove.            CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated with the timing of the House GOP's plans for releasing a health care bill. ||||| Politico has obtained a leaked draft of a Republican replacement plan for Obamacare. The plan may be somewhat outdated already — it is two weeks old, per its time stamp, and Republicans have been working hard on their proposal in the meantime — but it almost certainly reveals an important shift from earlier GOP plans.      In broad strokes, the draft bill hews closely to ideas outlined by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Compared with the Affordable Care Act, this proposal would generally be worse for people who are poorer and sicker — but better for those who are higher-income and healthy. Democrats will near certainly blast this proposal as bad for the 21 million Americans who rely on Obamacare for coverage.      But buried in the details of the 106-page document is actually a bit of an evolution on the part of the Republican Party. I’ve spent a lot of time reading Republican replacement plans for Obamacare, and this is definitely a more consumer-friendly version of their ideas than those introduced in the past.      This bill — and we don’t know right now which committee it came from or which legislators back it — has more generous financial support for those who buy their own plans, for example, and lower penalties for Americans who do not maintain continuous insurance coverage.      Republicans seem pretty wedded to the reform concepts they outlined years ago. This includes things like age-based tax credits, a continuous coverage provision instead of an individual mandate, and a significant scaling back of the Medicaid expansion.      But Republicans seem open to changing the details of how those provisions are implemented. What this means for patients will, in a lot of ways, come down to the smaller decisions: how big those age-based tax credits are, for example, or how much an individual who doesn’t maintain continuous coverage could be penalized. On that front, there really is a notable shift on the part of Republicans toward a plan that would be more financially generous.      The leaked Republican plan restricts — but doesn’t ban — discriminating against people with preexisting conditions      The leaked Republican draft, like Obamacare, requires insurance plans to offer coverage to all patients regardless of how sick they are. But the leaked plan, unlike Obamacare, would let insurers charge sick people more if they did not maintain “continuous coverage.”      This continuous coverage policy has shown up a lot in Republican replacement plans. It was part of Speaker Ryan’s A Better Way proposal and Rep. Price’s Empowering Patients First Act.      Here’s how it works: If a cancer patient goes straight from insurance at work to her own policy, her insurer has to charge her a standard rate — it can’t take the cost of her condition into account.      But if she had a lapse in coverage — perhaps she couldn’t afford a new plan between jobs — and went to the individual market later, insurers could charge her up to 130 percent of the standard rate for her first year of coverage. She would have to pay that higher rate for a full year before getting access to the normal rate.      This is a notably less harsh penalty than the one that Price suggested in his 2015 Empowering Patients First Act. In that bill, he would have allowed insurers to charge people like this 150 percent of the standard premium for 18 months.      The leaked draft does have a safety net for people who can’t afford to buy this more expensive coverage. It would invest 100 billion over 10 years into funding state efforts to cover “high-risk individuals” or to “help stabilize premiums for health insurance coverage in the individual market.”      States could presumably put this money toward high-risk pools, an idea that shows up in many other conservative proposals, although in the leaked draft they wouldn’t necessary have to.      This is significantly more generous than other Republican proposals for how much to spend on the especially high-cost patients. Ryan’s plan, for example, would put 25 billion toward the high-risk pools over a decade (2.5 billion per year) and keep them running indefinitely. The Price plan envisions only 3 billion for high risk pools over three years.      The leaked bill would generally be worse for people who are poorer and sicker, but better for attracting enrollees who are young and healthy. Perhaps most notably, however, the bill is generally more generous and consumer-friendly to all enrollees than previous policy proposals.      Still, it’s unclear whether this would actually meet the needs of Americans with especially costly conditions. I’ve had some conservative health policy experts suggest to me that it would take about 25 billion per year to make high-risk pools function properly. And again, the funds in this leaked bill are not earmarked just for high-risk pools, and could be spent in other ways — meaning the funding could be much lower than the numbers outlined here.      The leaked draft makes insurance better for people who are young and healthy. It makes insurance worse for people who are old and sick.      One constant Obamacare gripe from Republicans is that the health care law mandates too big of a benefit package. This drives up premiums, they argue, and scares off some healthy and young enrollees who want to buy a skimpier plan.      There is some truth to this argument. Obamacare’s marketplaces have struggled to attract young adults at the level the White House had initially hoped. (The Obama administration originally said it wanted one-third of the marketplace to be people between the ages of 18 and 34, but right now it’s only about a quarter.)      The leaked draft makes the individual market more advantageous for healthier people. It eliminates the essential health benefits package, which mandated that all insurers cover a set of 10 different types of care, including maternity services and pediatric care. The leaked draft would allow states to decide which benefits are “essential.”      Some states might choose skimpier benefit packages that would allow insurers to cut certain benefits they no longer want to cover — they could stop covering maternity benefits, for example, to make their plans less attractive to women who plan to become pregnant. This would likely benefit healthy people, who generally want less robust coverage at a cheaper price. But it’ll send the cost of more comprehensive plans — the plans sicker people need — skyrocketing. And it could leave someone who wants, say, health insurance to cover her maternity costs completely out of luck.      There are other ways the leaked draft makes insurance better for young people too: by letting insurance plans charge them lower rates.      It does this by allowing insurers to charge their oldest enrollees as much as they want. Right now insurers can only charge the oldest enrollees three times as much as the youngest — that constrains prices for patients in their 50s and 60s.      Eliminating this regulation “increases the overall number of people with coverage, but older people end up falling out of the market as premiums rise,” says Christine Eibner, an economist with the RAND Corporation who has modeled similar changes to Obamacare’s age-rating provisions.      And while young people might have cheaper premiums and an easier ability to enroll, older Americans could struggle to purchase coverage in this market, where their costs would rise. These are people who tend to have more urgent health care needs and could be in a worse position without health care than a young adult might be.      This worries some Obamacare supporters, who say the goal of insurance reform isn’t just to expand coverage — it’s to expand coverage for people who really need health care.      “If you replace a 60-year-old with a 20-year-old, that doesn’t change the number of people covered, but it changes the value of the coverage and of the program,” says Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist who helped the White House model the economic effects of Obamacare.      The leaked draft would provide tax credits, but they would help older (and likely richer) people more      The leaked draft, like Obamacare, envisions that Americans will use tax credits to purchase individual health insurance, but the structure of the tax credits is very different.      Obamacare’s tax credits are based on income, with those who earn less getting more help. The leaked draft’s tax credits would only be based on age, giving more help to those who are older (and who will presumably be charged higher premiums). The tax credits outlined in the bill are as follows:      2,000 for those under 30      2,500 for those between 30 and 40      3,000 for those between 40 and 50      3,500 for those between 50 and 60      4,000 for those over 60      This means that Bill Gates would qualify for the largest tax credit simply because he is 61 years old. Under the Empowering Patients bill, Gates’s net worth of 83 billion — presumably enough to purchase health coverage — would do nothing to disqualify him. Under Obamacare, he gets no help.      Conversely, a 23-year-old with little income who has health problems gets minimal help under Price’s plan — despite the fact that she needs support much more than Gates does.      But what was especially notable to me about these credits is that they’re significantly more generous than the ones that Price proposed in his 2015 Empowering Patients First Act. He suggested the following tax credits:      900 for children under 18      1,200 for those between 18 and 35      2,100 for those between 36 and 50      3,000 for those 51 and older      The plans under the leaked proposal would almost certainly be cheaper because they wouldn’t have to cover so many benefits. A 55-year-old under this health care system, for example, might find lower premiums for plans that cover fewer benefits. But it’s also true that the plans that do offer comprehensive benefits would likely prove financially out of reach for many.      The leaked draft repeals Medicaid expansion without any replacement      Under this proposal, states could continue to cover the Medicaid expansion population — but they would get significantly less federal funding, which could push some states to drop out of the program entirely.      Separate from the Affordable Care Act, the leaked draft suggests dramatically cutting funding for the Medicaid program entirely. Right now states and the federal government split Medicare patients’ bills. Each pays a certain percentage of the costs. The commitment to paying those medical bills is essentially unlimited: The two governments will pay whatever bills rack up.      The leaked draft, however, would change that entirely. It suggests a “per capita cap” model, where each state would get a set amount for the number of people it was expected to enroll. If states were able to keep costs low, they might even be able to keep some of that money. But states could get into trouble if they found that they were spending more per person than their federal funding expected. They might need to cut back on the benefits the program offers, for example, or cover fewer people to make the numbers work.      You can read more about how a proposal like this works in a longer explainer here.      It’s very easy to see the ideas in this draft changing a lot in the coming weeks and months. Republican governors like Ohio’s John Kasich and Michigan’s Rick Snyder have begun to advocate for keeping Medicaid expansion, which covers thousands in their home states. Kasich is meeting with President Trump today and will certainly press the issue, and dozens of governors will be in Washington this weekend for the National Governors Association conference. You can bet this is a section they care about a lot — and will try to change significantly.      The leaked draft has a new tax on high-cost health insurance plans that employers offer      Most of the changes in the leaked draft have to do with people who get insurance through Medicaid or on the marketplaces. But there is one important change the plan would make to employer-sponsored insurance: It would cap the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage.      The health insurance tax break is the biggest in the federal budget; the government loses out on 260 billion annually by not taxing health benefits. And economists across the political spectrum agree that we should eliminate or at least reduce this tax break, which currently gives those with jobs a huge discount on their coverage — and an incentive to buy more coverage than they actually need.      The leaked draft proposes taxing any employer-sponsored coverage above the 90th percentile of current premiums. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Obamacare had something awfully similar: the “Cadillac tax,” which was a 40 percent excise tax on especially high-cost health care plans.      As popular as this provision will be with economists, you can bet that the public will hate it, as it would make some health plans significantly more expensive. There is already a lobbying campaign to kill this provision — even before Republicans have officially proposed the idea.      “During meetings on Capitol Hill last week, there were acknowledgements of the role of the group market and a commitment to not disrupting that,” says Ed Fensholt, a senior vice president at the health brokerage firm Lockton. “I think there was, however, a lack of understanding that certain things they do might have a disruptive effect.”      Watch: Obamacare in Trump country ||||| A doctor discusses medical treatment with a patient. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)      The public perception of President Barack Obama's health care law is becoming more positive as the Affordable Care Act faces threats of repeal, according to a new poll.      The favorability ratings are at their highest recorded levels since the summer of 2010. The poll, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, has been conducted more than 60 times.      To assemble the data researchers surveyed 1,160 adults by phone in mid-February about their opinions regarding different portions of the law, sometimes called Obamacare. They found that 48 percent of those surveyed now have favorable views of the Affordable Care Act – up from 43 percent in December. In comparison, 42 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable view of Obamacare, down from 46 percent in the December poll.      The shift was driven largely by people who identified as being politically independent, and the unfavorability rates did not fall below their lowest levels, recorded in July 2010, when they were at 35 percent.      Prior to the most recent poll, the public's views on the law were more unfavorable than favorable, even as its major provisions became enacted and about 21 million people gained coverage or more robust health insurance.      Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump have long vowed to undo the Affordable Care Act, though they haven't said what they would replace it with. Democrats have seized on this lack of unity, holding events across the country to tell people about the dangers of repealing the law. During the past week activists and constituents have been protesting repeal at Republican town halls.      In watching lawmakers talk about repealing the law, Americans reported mixed emotions: 56 percent are worried, 53 percent are hopeful, 45 percent are confused, 38 percent are angry and 33 percent are enthusiastic. Nearly half of those surveyed said that they feared someone in their family would lose coverage if the law is repealed and replaced.      Despite the change in overall attitudes, the survey reveals people remain split on what should happen to the law next. Most of those who favor repeal, however, would like to see a replacement plan first.      The survey also examined people’s views on Medicaid expansion, which was a provision of the law that allowed states to provide no- or low-cost coverage to low-income residents. Republicans in Congress have been discussing what to do about this portion of the law, though GOP governors have cautioned that repealing expansion would be damaging to their constituents.      The majority of respondents, regardless of political leanings, said it was important that a replacement plan continues to provide federal funds to the 31 states and District of Columbia that expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act.      Republicans have offered other solutions for Medicaid, including a proposal that would allow funds to be distributed through block grants – which may limit funding but gives states more flexibility about what programs to prioritize and which people to cover – or change it to a per-capita allotment system.      Most respondents surveyed – 65 percent – reported that they would rather Medicaid continue as it is today than either of the offered alternatives to the current federal funding structure. Under the current structure, the federal government matches state spending but sets specific standards and benefits for states.            Corrected on Feb. 24, 2017 : A previous version of this story misstated the law's past popularity. |||||","output":"Public opinion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, is becoming more positive, even as the act faces possible repeal, according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Carefully fill it to the middle with water that you’d like to sanitize. Don’t go beyond the middle point or you could risk it boiling over. For that reason, the process will go quicker if you use larger pots. Place the water-filled pots on the stove and turn the heat up to the maximum level. Watch the water heat up until the entire surface is continually bubbling. If the water is at risk of boiling over the edge, turn down the heat or you’ll risk contaminating the entire area. Start the timer as soon as the rolling boil begins and no sooner. This is the minimum amount of time required to kill off any bacteria, such as E. coli, that is found in the water. If you are at an altitude higher than 6,562 feet, then you’ll need to boil the water for a minimum of 3 minutes. The water will be cool when the bubbles disappear and the steam is gone. Don’t rush the cooling off process or you might burn yourself. Carefully pour the sanitized water from the pot into a selected container.  It might help to use a funnel to transfer the water without spilling. Some people don’t like the taste of boiled water. In this case, pouring the water back and forth between 2 clean containers can improve the taste. If you are only purifying small amounts of water at a time, then you’ll need to store it. If possible, purchase food-grade water storage containers from an outdoor supply store. Otherwise, use non-glass containers with secure lids to hold the clean water.  Never use a storage container that’s held toxic liquids, such as pesticides, beforehand. Wash the container with dishwashing soap and warm water before filling it with water. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to sanitize water by boiling it. The process involves using a metal pot, filling it halfway with water, boiling it for a certain amount of time based on altitude, and then allowing it to cool before transferring it to a clean storage container.

He was the iconic founder and owner of the National Football League's Chicago Bears. He was also lesser known as an inventor, jurist, radio producer, philanthropist, philatelist, and Major League Baseball player. Most notably, he is considered one of the original co-founders of the National Football League (NFL) in 1920.  - August Mike Michalske ( April 24 , 1903 - October 26 , 1983 ) was an American football player and coach . He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964 .

An All - America fullback during his Penn State career , the 6 - foot , 210 pound Michalske convinced Packers coach Curly Lambeau to try him on the offensive line , where he became the first great guard in pro football , known for his combination of speed , agility and power . The first guard inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame , Michalske was a key blocker in the Packers ' championship seasons in 1929 , 1930 , and 1931 , opening holes for the likes of Johnny \`\` Blood '' McNally and Bob Monnett . Michalske also played on the defensive line and was dubbed \`\` Iron Mike '' because despite playing 60 minutes a game , he missed only 9 of 104 games during his Packers tenure , 5 of them in his final season . Moreover , throughout his football career he played with an unrepaired congenital abdominal hernia . Michalske was a six time consensus first team All - Pro in 1927 - 1931 and 1935 .

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - Earl Louis \\"Curly\\" Lambeau (April 9, 1898  June 1, 1965) was a professional American football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL).

The monthly budget plan Christopher created was blown by Jeffrey, thanks to  Options:  -Christopher making very bad decisions.  -Jeffrey making very bad decisions.","output":"The monthly budget plan Christopher created was blown by Jeffrey, thanks to Jeffrey making very bad decisions. This scenario suggests that Christopher had taken the initiative to create a monthly budget plan, possibly for their household, a project, or a shared expense, with the intention of managing finances and ensuring that spending remains at a reasonable level. Such a budget plan might have included allocations for a variety of expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, groceries, utility bills, entertainment, and other personal or shared expenditures. However, the sentence states that Jeffrey was responsible for blowing this carefully-crafted budget, due to his very bad decisions. There could be numerous scenarios in which this might occur, such as the following examples: 1. Impulsive spending: Jeffrey might have a tendency to make impulsive purchases, such as buying items that were not accounted for in the budget, or spending much more on a specific category than the allocated amount. This overspending would lead to the funds planned for other expenses being depleted, ultimately causing the budget to fail. 2. Incurring debts or liabilities: Another way in which Jeffrey could have made decisions that detrimentally impacted the budget is by incurring new debts, perhaps due to poor financial choices or a lack of foresight. Accumulating high levels of debt can strain the monthly budget, as funds must be allocated to pay off these obligations, in addition to the existing expenses. 3. Failing to stick to the budget: Jeffrey could also blow the budget by not adhering to it in the first place. Disregarding Christopher's plan and spending money on unnecessary items or activities would result in an imbalanced financial situation, putting pressure on the limited resources available. 4. Unexpected emergencies: Sometimes, unforeseen events like accidents, medical emergencies, or urgent repairs can lead to significant expenses that were not originally accounted for in the budget. While such situations might not be the direct result of Jeffrey's decisions, his inability or unwillingness to prepare for unforeseen circumstances might contribute to the budget's failure. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"Jeffrey making very bad decisions,\\" suggesting that despite Christopher's efforts in creating a comprehensive monthly budget plan, Jeffrey's ill-advised actions led to the downfall of the budget. This unfortunate outcome highlights the importance of responsible financial management and the need for all parties involved to cooperate in adhering to the agreed-upon budget."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 25-year-old believed he was seeing demons and \\"ran amok\\" through back gardens in Edmonton, north London before the attack, the court heard. He will be detained indefinitely in a psychiatric hospital. Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC told Salvador: \\"It is established beyond any doubt that you killed Mrs Silva in an attack of extraordinary brutality and ferocity. \\"You thought you were encountering some demonic force which had taken on a human form. You could not have been more deluded. \\"Nobody who saw it could forget the mild and trusting way Mrs Silva approached you over the wall while you were brandishing a knife.\\" He said Mrs Silva was a \\"gentle, intelligent\\" woman who deserved to live her life \\"in peace and with security, proud in the achievements of others\\". The Old Bailey heard Salvador vaulted into Mrs Silva's garden and, after a brief exchange, stabbed her repeatedly before cutting her head off. Her granddaughter Christina Silva said: \\"You don't really know how to comprehend this happened, you still to this day think it is a big nightmare and you think you're going to wake up and everything will be fine.\\" She added: \\"Every day I wake up and replay the attack on my grandmother in my head. Since the attack I have completely changed from the person I used to be. \\"The thought of being alone in the house terrifies me.\\" Mrs Silva's daughter, Celestina Muis, said her mother's death had devastated the whole family who \\"no longer feel safe\\". She said: \\"Palmira had a full life, loving her children, grandchildren and great grandchild. She was very much the glue that held us all together. \\"Our lives have been torn apart knowing what happened to my mother.\\" Mrs Silva's family wiped away tears and hugged each other as the verdict was read out in court. CCTV footage showed Salvador killing two cats before targeting Mrs Silva. He lost his job three days before the incident, and smoked skunk cannabis, the court heard. His trial heard two psychiatrists agreed he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. When he carried out the killing, he believed Mrs Silva was a supernatural entity, either Adolf Hitler back from the dead or a demon who had taken the form of an old lady, jurors heard. He was staying with friends three doors away from the Italian-born grandmother's house in Nightingale Road when he went on the rampage. Salvador was remanded in custody at Belmarsh prison but, due to his mental state, he was moved to high-security Broadmoor Hospital. Enfield Inspector Doug Skinner said the there were children playing in nearby gardens when Salvador was jumping over fences. \\"We genuinely thought he would kill those children and we were filled with utter terror,\\" he said. In court, Salvador's barrister Bernard Richmond said he was regarded as a decent man, when he was not unwell. He said: \\"Mental illness in whatever circumstances can be terrifying for the person and one of the things we have to bear in mind that, after this case is finished, he will have to continue, as his mental state improves, coming to terms with the horror of what he did when he was unwell.\\"","output":"In September last year, Nicholas Salvador killed 82-year-old Palmira Silva believing he was seeing demons and \\"ran amok\\" through back gardens in Edmonton, North London.

Question: The answer to the question: What singer was going to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman? is inside the article: During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Write highlights for this article: The two British women accused of attempting to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5 million out of Peru have been branded liars by the lawyer who prepared the preliminary case against them. And he says their refusal to confess increases their prospect of facing 15 years in prison. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Dr Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney’s office anti-drugs unit, dismissed the women’s stories. Scroll down for video. Living a nightmare: Michaella McCollum Connolly, left, and Melissa Reid in a Lima court. He said their excuses were ‘very well practised’, they had been coached in what to say and their ‘demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened’. The lawyer, who led the investigation for the first 15 days, said that Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, had no proof to back up any of their claims. Last week The Mail on Sunday printed the women’s police statements in full and revealed that Miss Reid’s father, William, thinks she should plead guilty. Dr Mendoza Abarca said: ‘They don’t even have one element of proof. Unfortunately, their stories are not believable – their stories are incredible. They staged this whole thing from the beginning because they knew it was possible they would get caught and if they did get caught they had the excuses really well planned. ‘The problem is that they received the drugs, they packed the drugs in their bags and they went to the airport. But had they been given the bags packed already – which is what usually happens – then it’s another story. When somebody is threatened, you can tell. I have spoken to the girls and their demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened because of the way they acted.’ Dr Mendoza Abarca questioned the women for three hours and thinks they will end up pleading guilty to get a shorter sentence. Dr Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney's office anti-drugs unit, is interviewed by reporter Simon Murphy. He added: ‘It’s very obvious that they were trained in what to say if they were caught. They were prepared in every sense. They were told to take pictures of themselves having a good time, to try to act as normal as possible. All of the excuses were very well practised.’ This comes as The Mail on Sunday has uncovered fresh information about the women’s capture at Lima  airport:. Michaella McCollum Connolly (L) and Melissa Reid (R) were detained allegedly with 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to Madrid, Spain, at the international airport Jorge Chavez in Callao, near Lima, Peru. The case is now in the hands of the judiciary, but Dr Mendoza Abarca has been privy to all the evidence in the first 15 days of the case. His remarks provide a stark assessment of the women’s hopes of proving their innocence. If they continue to plead not guilty they will receive a minimum of eight and maximum of 15 years behind bars, he warns. ‘The biggest part, for me, was when they started crying when I asked them about their families,’ he said. ‘There’s no way in the world they would risk their families’ safety for that many days when they could have come forward and told the authorities they’d been threatened. ‘They are going to end up pleading guilty to get the minimum sentence, that’s what they always end up doing in my experience.’ He added: ‘When they were first questioned, their demeanour was very flat and they were just repeating their story. Usually when a mule is caught they come out with lots of different stories and explanations – they have lots of detail. These girls’ stories were just too superficial. ‘They could have come forward before. They had the opportunities to. The authorities in this country and their country would have done everything that was necessary to protect their families and to make sure nothing happened to them. ‘If that had happened, they actually would have had the opportunity to catch the real people involved because they would have done whatever was necessary to catch the real bosses. But they didn’t do that. They waited to be caught.’ Dr Mendoza Abarca also ruled out the possibility that the women were sacrificed to let a bigger load of drugs though, explaining that once the girls had been caught all flights were put on high alert. He added that CCTV showing the girls’ movements just before they went to the airport ‘showed nobody was holding a gun to their head’. ‘No one was seen to force them to do anything,’ he said. ‘They may have been used to carry drugs but they may also have been offered compensation for it because they were just freely walking around.’ Joke: Melissa Reid has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home. Melissa Reid has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home, describing  her nightmare ordeal in a squalid Peruvian prison. But she has managed to keep her sense of humour and was able to joke: ‘Hope I look good on TV! (as good as I can that is.)’ Reid has spent her first full week behind bars with Michaella McCollum Connolly in a grim prison alongside murderers and terrorists. She describes the experience as ‘frustrating and scary’ but is ‘taking it one day at a time’.  Melissa tells friends that Michaella, from Northern Ireland, is ‘like a sister to me now’. Writing to friends at home in Glasgow from Virgen de Fatima prison, Melissa says: ‘Makes me sick to think I was meant to still be having the summer of a lifetime in beefa [Ibiza] baby but instead I am in a woman’s prison in Peru. I suppose it hasn’t quite hit home.’ After complaining that she misses her mother’s cooking, Melissa describes to another friend how she witnessed a hungry inmate sucking chicken bones, calling it ‘a different ball game’. At the prison, the women undergo a military-style regime. There is a head count at 6am, the inmates are locked in their cells from 6pm and lights go out at 9pm. Melissa and Michaella face up to three years there while they await trial. They are forced to take cold showers, which often cut out, and are confined to their cell most of the day. They are kept isolated from the main prison population while officials monitor their progress. Writing to her friends, Melissa said: ‘I am taking it day by day. It’s too hard to look at the long term as I will drive myself insane!’ To another friend she wrote: ‘If it was someone I knew in this position I would set up like a petition for David Cameron or something? I don’t know if it will  help but surely it will put pressure on them! I just wish we were back having the summer of our lives everything is so f****d up now!’ She added: ‘My 21st [birthday] will be in a Peruvian prison ahhh!!!!’ The pair could spend up to three years in jail in Peru as they await their trial. Last night, Melissa’s father, William, bid an emotional goodbye to his daughter as he prepared to fly back to Britain. Breaking down in tears, Melissa told him: ‘I’m going to find it so hard not knowing when I’ll next see you or Mum.’ Mr Reid said: ‘I think prison has been a reality check for them both. They now know that this is going to be where they’re going to spend a considerable period of time. ‘Melissa has always been looking forward to my next visit but when I’m gone, she’ll not know when she’ll see her family again. ‘I’ve tried to explain to her why I think she should plead guilty. She is guilty of transporting drugs, but she can say she’s sorry for those actions and the hurt and misery it’s brought to her family. She’s just got to take the medicine that goes with that and move on.’","output":"In a recent article, two British women, Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, were accused of attempting to smuggle £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of Peru.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's top pick to replace chief of staff John Kelly, Nick Ayers, is no longer expected to fill the role.      Ayers, who is chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, was seen as the favorite for the job when Trump announced Saturday that Kelly would leave around year's end. But a White House official said Sunday that Trump and Ayers could not reach agreement on Ayers' length of service and that he would instead assist the president from outside the administration.      Ayers confirmed the decision in a tweet Sunday, thanking Trump and Pence for giving him the opportunity to work in the White House. \\"I will be departing at the end of the year but will work with the #MAGA team to advance the cause,\\" he said.      It was not immediately clear whether Trump had a new favorite for the post. The official was not authorized to discuss the personnel issue by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.      Ayers and Trump had discussed the job for months. The new hire was to be key to a West Wing reshuffling to shift focus toward the 2020 re-election campaign and the challenge of governing with Democrats in control of the House.      Trump wants his next chief of staff to hold the job through the 2020 election, the official said. Ayers, who has young triplets, had long planned to leave the administration at the end of the year, and had only agreed to serve in an interim basis through next spring.      Ayers will run a pro-Trump super PAC, according to a person familiar with his plans who was not authorized to discuss them by name.      Trump said Saturday that he expected to announce a replacement for Kelly in a day or two.      With Ayers out of the running, Trump is considering four candidates for the post, including Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney, according to a person familiar with the president's thinking. He is to make a decision by the end of the year, said the person, was not authorized to discuss the personnel issue by name.      Kelly, whose last day on the job is set to be Jan. 2, had been credited with imposing order on a chaotic West Wing after his arrival in June 2017 from his post as homeland security secretary. But his iron first also alienated some longtime Trump allies, and over time he grew increasingly isolated, with an increasingly diminished role.      ___      Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.

While Indian reservations typical in most of the United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers.

Article: More and more pupils are giving teachers presents, but the practice only creates insecurity in parents and staff. I've certainly noticed some pupils being feverishly overgenerous of late. Last year, I received not one bottle of wine but four for helping a disaffected pupil through his GCSEs. By and large, my colleagues report the gifts differing along gender lines. Gentlemen get ties, mugs, booze and, if they're really lucky, tickets to football matches. The ladies are often presented with flowers, jewels, chocolates and so on. When my son was at private school, I noticed there was a real competitiveness between the students about giving presents to teachers, with expensive baskets from fancy stores and huge bouquets being handed out on the last days of term. Since my wife and I only let my son give thank-you cards, it was clear we were not \\"classy\\". Now he is at an inner-city primary, we've noticed that this kind of _ seems to have more or less disappeared. For one thing, there isn't that kind of money floating around - but there isn't that kind of competitive culture either. Personally, I think gifts to teachers should be banned beyond the thank-you card: they cause many more problems than they solve, creating insecurity in both parents and staff. Perhaps the recession and the lack of money in people's pockets might be a good excuse for the government to issue some guidelines to schools that gifts shouldn't be accepted by teachers. The gifts that I really value are the cards which say a genuine thank you. I still keep them in a file at home.

This 17-year-old teenager from North Fayette, Pa., has a rare condition called Kleine-Levin  Syndrome -- or \\"Sleeping Beauty Syndrome\\" -- that makes her sleep 18 to 19 hours a day. And when she does wake up, she is often so tired out that she is in a sleepwalking state and  doesn't remember doing basic things like eating, according to KDKA-TV. Nicole's sleepwalking state has been so severe that she once slept through the holidays, awaking one day in January when she finally opened Christmas gifts alongside her family,  according to ChartiersValley.Patch.com.   . \\"She's never really adjusted to it,\\" her mother, Vicki Delien told the website. \\"She's 17 now  and it really upsets her.

Answer:","output":"Lukram James Singh, popularly known as James Singh, is an eminent Indian football player hailed from Imphal, Manipur, India. Born on 1st March 1981, Singh, from a young age, displayed immense interested and talent in football. Recognizing this, he was incepted into Tata FA, one of the reputable youth football academies in India, where he gained formal training from 1996 to 1998. This early initiation into the world of football laid the foundation for Singh's illustrious career in the sport.  Kickstarting his professional career, Singh joined the prestigious Tata Bank football club in 1998. He showcased commendable skills and versatility, primarily playing as a winger. Over the years, Singh continued to elevate his career, demonstrating his talent with other famed clubs including Mahindra United, Mohun Bagan, Salgaocar, Prayag United, and ITI Limited. His years in these teams spanned from 1998 to 2013, with loan stints in between.  In 2002, Singh enjoyed a stint with Mahindra United, a time during which he began to receive acknowledgement at the national level. Following this, he shifted to the Kolkata-based Mohun Bagan in 2005. He then returned to Mahindra United for a three-year period from 2007-2010. After a brief stint with Salgaocar in 2010-2011, he moved on to Prayag United.  In 2013, Singh took on a new challenge when he started playing for the United Sikkim Football Club on loan from IMG Reliance. This stint with United Sikkim FC gave Singh a new platform to display his skills, contributing significantly towards the club's prestige. However, Singh's accomplishments weren't limited to the football club territory. He also made striking contributions to his country, representing the Indian National Football team beginning 2003. Even though he predominantly served as a winger, Singh earned a total of 8 caps for India which signifies his major contributions at the national level. Despite not scoring any goals at the international level, his skills, agility, and presence on the field have been invaluable to the team. Singh's physical attributes also lent considerably to his successful career. At 1.70 meters tall, he possessed the perfect height for his winger position, able to maintain agility and speed on the field. Today, Lukaram James Singh stands as one of the celebrated figures in Indian football, remembering for his impressive stints with multiple top-tier clubs as well as his dedicated service to the Indian National team. Despite the ups and downs, Singh's journey paints a vivid portrait of passion, diligence, and unwavering commitment to the sport of football.  Attached to this biography is an image of Singh.

Movie plot title: Waking Life Movie plot: Waking Life is about an unnamed[3] young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other charactersâranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friendsâabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of AndrÃ© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to...

High salt concentrations can negatively affect a butterfly's habitat. Increased salt content in the soil can alter the types and growth rates of plants, which provide essential food and shelter for butterflies during their life cycle. As a result, butterflies may struggle to find suitable food sources and secure places to lay their eggs. They may experience slower growth rates as caterpillars, leading to reduced numbers of viable pupae and adult butterflies. Consequently, there would likely be fewer butterflies in an environment with increased salt levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches.  Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","output":"To determine which fruit retained their quality longer between apples and peaches, we need to consider both fresh and candied versions of these fruits. It is important to note that the candying process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. However, we need to compare the shelf-life of fresh apples and peaches to fully answer the question. Apples are known for their relatively long storage life when compared to other fruits. If stored in optimal conditions (cool, dark, and slightly humid), the quality of fresh apples can be maintained from a few weeks up to several months, depending on the apple variety. Some apple varieties, like Granny Smith and Fuji, can stay fresh for an even longer period when stored properly. On the other hand, peaches are a relatively perishable fruit. If left at room temperature, a ripe peach will usually only last for about a week. Peaches can be stored in the refrigerator for a longer storage life, but even then, they will typically stay fresh for only about two weeks. With this information, we can now compare the shelf-life of apples and peaches: 1. Candied apples: As mentioned earlier, the candying process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. 2. Fresh apples: Depending on the variety and storage conditions, fresh apples can last from a few weeks up to several months. 3. Candied peaches: Like candied apples, the candying process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. 4. Fresh peaches: When stored in the refrigerator, fresh peaches can last up to two weeks. Considering both fresh and candied forms, apples in general have a longer shelf-life when compared to peaches. Fresh apples can last up to several months, while fresh peaches can only last up to two weeks. Additionally, both candied apples and candied peaches have a similar shelf-life of up to a year due to the preservation method. Therefore, apples are better at retaining their quality for a longer period compared to peaches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas.  First day when he studied the ants the temperature was 10 degree Centigrade. In the second day of his study the temperature rose to 25 degree Centigrade. In the third  day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which day David would see openings in the nest hatch open, third day or fourth day? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that David would likely see openings in the nest hatch on the fourth day of his study. This is because ants, like many other organisms, are sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity.  When the temperature rose from 10°C on the first day to 25°C on the second day, the ants in the Acromyrmex heyeri colony may have become more active due to the more favorable conditions. As the temperature increases, ants will move around more to forage and care for their brood. This increased activity often leads to the opening of nest hatch entrances to facilitate the flow of air and maintain the optimal temperature and humidity within the nest. On the third day, there was an increase in air humidity, which would also have an impact on the ants' behavior. High humidity levels can affect ants' ability to maintain their nests' structural integrity and possibly their foraging efficiency. Ants can respond to increased humidity by sealing the nest hatch or creating special chambers within the colony to maintain their preferred humidity levels. In this scenario, it might prevent the openings in the nest hatch from being visible or open. However, on the fourth day, the air humidity dropped, which could signal to the ants that they need to open the nest hatch to maintain the ideal conditions within the nest. As the humidity decreases, ants might increase their activity levels and promote increased airflow within the colony. Thus, it is more likely that David would see the nest hatch openings on the fourth day as the colony adjusts their behavior and environment for the lower humidity conditions. Of course, it is essential to note that David's observations may not be the same when he moves to Asia to study the same species. Environmental conditions, as well as regional behavioral differences, must be taken into consideration when studying ant species as they adapt to their unique environments. Nevertheless, based on the given information, the fourth day seems the most plausible day for observing the nest hatch openings in the Acromyrmex heyeri ants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question:   A small nation decided to ramp up its production capabilities and built several large factories. Would the river next to the factories have more hazardous waste or less hazardous waste??    Paragraph :  Nations that have more industry produce more hazardous waste.","output":"Based on the information given in the text paragraph, it can be concluded that the river next to the factories in the small nation would likely have more hazardous waste.  The paragraph clearly indicates a correlation between industrialization and the production of hazardous waste, stating that, \\"Nations that have more industry produce more hazardous waste.\\" With this, it is reasonable to infer that an increase in industrial activity often brings an increase in the production of hazardous waste.  Now, applying this understanding to the question details about a small nation deciding to increase its industrial capacity by building several large factories, we can infer a probable increase in hazardous waste creation. Factories, especially on a large scale, are typically known for manufacturing processes that often produce various forms of waste, including hazardous ones. This is due to the utilization of different materials, chemicals, or production processes that generate waste as a byproduct. It's also pertinent to note that the factories are stated to be next to a river. This implies a likelihood for the waste to find its way into the river either through direct dumping, runoff, accidental spillage or through seepage into groundwater that eventually feeds into the river. Such pollution could have detrimental effects on the river's ecosystem, including the water quality and the variety of life that it supports. However, it's important to remember that these conclusions are assumptive and depend on various factors in real scenarios. For instance, if the small nation enforces strict environmental guidelines and the factories have advanced and effective waste management systems in place to securely contain and properly dispose of hazardous waste, the impact on the river could be minimal despite the increase in industrial activity. But, lacking specifics to this effect, the most straightforward answer, based on the data given, is that the river next to the factories in the small nation would likely have more hazardous waste due to an increase in industrial production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The verb \\"to be\\" in past form translates to \\"war\\", \\"dies\\" means \\"this\\", and \\"keine leichte Aufgabe\\" is \\"not an easy task\\".  This approach ensured that the sentence maintained its original structure and conveyed the same overall meaning in German as in English."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If microbes can help an animal to grow and heal, then what can help an animal to grow and heal?  Answer choices: - food  - heat  - bones  - energy  - cells  - microbes  - glycogen  - proteins","output":"To answer this question, let us consider each of the given answer choices step by step: 1. Food - Food provides essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for an animal's growth and healing. It is the primary source of energy, and the building blocks for cells, tissues, and organs. 2. Heat - Heat can be beneficial for an animal's healing in some contexts, such as maintaining optimal body temperature for proper functioning. However, it is not a primary factor in growth and healing. 3. Bones - Bones provide structural support for an animal's body, and their growth and repair are essential, particularly during the healing process. However, they are not the primary factor or direct contributor to overall growth and healing. 4. Energy - An animal requires energy for all its metabolic processes, including growth and healing. Though necessary, energy alone is not enough to ensure an animal's growth and healing. 5. Cells - Cells underlie every single process in an animal's body. They multiply and differentiate to contribute to growth and healing, thus playing a vital role. 6. Microbes - As mentioned in the question, microbes can indeed support an animal's growth and healing by contributing to digestion and overall gut health, enhancing immunity, and promoting the synthesis of essential vitamins. 7. Glycogen - Glycogen is a stored form of energy derived from carbohydrates. Although it plays a role in providing energy for an animal, it is not the primary factor for growth and healing. 8. Proteins - Proteins are essential for an animal's growth and healing as they are the building blocks of cells, tissues, and organs. They play a critical role in various processes, including muscle rebuilding and repairing damaged tissues during healing. In conclusion, considering the answer choices given, several factors can help an animal grow and heal. Those factors can include food (source of nutrients), cells (essential for growth and regeneration), microbes (aiding gut health and immunity), and proteins (building blocks for growth and repair)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(2:11)      AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Dustin Johnson took a serious fall on a staircase Wednesday and injured his lower back, and his manager said it was uncertain whether the world's No. 1 golfer would be able to play in the Masters.      It was a stunning development on an otherwise quiet day at Augusta National, where the course was shut down at 1:30 p.m. ET because of storms.      The real calamity struck a few hours later.      Dustin Johnson took what his agent called a \\"serious fall\\" down a staircase at his rental home on Wednesday, a day before the Masters is set to begin. Andrew Redington/Getty Images      David Winkle, Johnson's manager at Hambric Sports, said his client fell on the bare wood stairs at the home he is renting in Augusta. Johnson's trainer, Joey Diovisalvi, told Masters Radio on SiriusXM on Wednesday night that Johnson was going out to the garage to move a car when he slipped on three wooden steps.      Johnson landed on his lower back and both elbows.      \\"He landed very hard on his lower back and is now resting, although quite uncomfortably,\\" Winkle said in an email Wednesday. Winkle added that Johnson was advised to remain immobile and begin a regimen of anti-inflammatory medication and icing in hopes of being able to play Thursday.      Diovisalvi told SiriusXM that they are optimistic Johnson will be able to play Thursday, but first they will have to see how he feels in the morning.      What might help Johnson is that he is in the final group for the opening round, scheduled to tee off at 2:03 p.m. ET with two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson and PGA champion Jimmy Walker.      Johnson was an 11-2 favorite to win the Masters entering Wednesday, according to the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook. After news of his injury, his odds dropped to 7-1, the same as Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy.      Johnson has had his share of mishaps in a major but not before the event even started.

Golfers enjoy family time at rain-soaked Par 3 With their wives and kids in tow, Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson made the most of a weather-shortened Par 3 Contest on a rainy day in Augusta by enjoying quality family time. 1 Related      On Tuesday, Winkle described Johnson as being \\"in as good a shape as I've ever seen him in every aspect of his game and his life.\\"      On Wednesday, Johnson was at Augusta National to play nine holes before the first wave of storms moved in.      Johnson has won three straight tournaments -- including a pair of World Golf Championships -- heading into the Masters to rise to world No. 1.      He had been scheduled to attend the Golf Writers Association of America annual dinner Wednesday night to accept its award as male player of the year. He was coming off a season in which he won the U.S. Open for his first major, was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year for the first time, won the PGA Tour money title and captured the Vardon Trophy for the lowest adjusted scoring average.      If he is unable to play Thursday, Johnson would be the fourth world No. 1 to miss a major championship, joining McIlroy (2015 Open, ankle), Greg Norman (1988 Open, wrist) and Tiger Woods, who missed the 2014 Masters (back surgery), the 2008 Open (ACL surgery) and the 2008 PGA Championship (ACL surgery).      Winkle said he would not have any further comment until he knows more about Johnson's condition.      If Johnson cannot play, there are no alternates at the Masters.

His agent David Winkle says he still hopes to play tomorrow.      World number one Johnson fell on the stairs on Wednesday and \\"landed hard on his lower back\\".

Since winning last year's US Open he has been a commanding presence and built a telling aura.      Now his Masters bid is surrounded by uncertainty.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  and the situation: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.  Answer the following question: Which fruits would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure, bowl A or bowl B? A:","output":"Bowl B would be the fruits that would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure.  In Bowl A, the glace or candied fruits have undergone a preservation process in which they are saturated with sugar syrup, which causes them to develop a high osmotic pressure. This high osmotic pressure creates an unfavorable environment for spoilage microorganisms to grow, thus preserving the fruits for an extended period of time. In Bowl B, the non-glace fruits have not been subjected to the candying process and, as a result, they retain their natural moisture, sugar levels, and osmotic pressure. These fruits are more likely to support the growth of spoilage microorganisms, as they lack the high osmotic pressure that would deter microbial growth. In summary, the fruits in Bowl A (the glace fruits) will have unfavorable osmotic pressure preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms, whereas the fruits in Bowl B (the non-glace fruits) will not develop this unfavorable osmotic pressure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Donington Park has been forced to cancel this year's British round of MotoGP due to the failure of Circuit of Wales (CoW) bosses to fulfil funding obligations. Last year MotoGP rights holders Dorna signed a five-year agreement with CoW from 2015, despite the fact construction work had yet to commence on the troubled Ebbw Vale facility. It resulted in CoW turning to Donington Park chiefs for assistance for this year, believing they would then be able to take up the running of the event. The British Grand Prix in the MotoGP championship is in turmoil after Donington Park pulled out of hosting the 2015 race. Above is the start of the 2014 Grand Prix which took place at Silverstone. CoW, however, continues to face numerous planning hurdles which have clearly had a knock-on effect with regard to the distribution of funds, resulting in delays paying Donington Park. A statement from Donington Park Racing Ltd (DPRL) read: 'The situation at 10th February 2015 is very clear. 'Despite DPRL's best efforts, the time lost with CoW being unable to complete the funding arrangements has resulted in delays in almost all of the event's critically-important operational plans, from track works to equipment hire. 'Therefore, in the judgement of the board of DPRL, this current position could jeopardise the safe and successful running of the 2015 British MotoGP at Donington to such an extent that both the commercial risks and the lack of time are now too great to allow Donington to proceed. 'Therefore, Donington Park must withdraw from any further participation. Donington Park had previously held the British Grand Prix from 1987 through to 2009, with Australia's Casey Stoner (above) winning on a Ducati in 2008. 'Consequently, the 2015 British round of the FIM MotoGP World Championship will not now be held at Donington Park on August 30th 2015.' Christopher Tate, Donington Park managing director, has naturally expressed his bitter disappointment at the fact the race will not now take place at his circuit. 'The whole Donington team who have worked so hard here over the past six months to fulfil our part of the MotoGP planning are as disappointed as the many fans will be who wanted to see the event return to Donington Park,' said Tate. 'The position we are now in is, of course, frustrating and uncomfortable for all concerned. 'We have our overall business, our staff and their futures to consider, as well as our concerns for the fans. 'We have rebuilt so much of this facility and its global reputation in the years since 2010 under new ownership and management. The British round of the 2015 MotoGP season is now without a venue, with Silverstone one alternative. 'We are not going to risk all that, nor risk affecting the quality of the MotoGP fans' experience - looking after the fans is at the heart of what Donington does. 'It is this week, way past any normal deadlines, when we - in partnership with CoW - would have been committing to major expenditures. 'CoW have made it clear to us they are not now in a position to complete, so we have to withdraw and end the planned arrangement.' Donington has confirmed all fans who purchased tickets will be given a full refund due to their monies being held in an escrow account. It now remains to be seen whether CoW will turn to Silverstone, who held the event from 2010-2014, but like Donington they will require financial guarantees, and time may also be too short. Highlights:","output":"1. Donington Park cancels the 2015 British round of MotoGP due to Circuit of Wales (CoW) failing to fulfill funding obligations. 2. CoW signed a five-year agreement with MotoGP rights holders Dorna in 2015 despite construction delays at Ebbw Vale facility. 3.

Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lillith. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lillith's parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lillith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 13 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". MusicOMH's Max Raymond has praised the album as being \\"engrossing\\" due to the emotional depth of the lyrics as well as the warm and relaxed sound of the studio recording. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone gave the album a mixed review, praising the vocal harmonies. The diversity in sound was highlighted by AbsolutePunk's Gregory Robson, Jason Schneider of Exclaim! and The A.V. Club's Chris Martins, ranging from electric blues to psychedelia as well as the atypical lyrics from Guthrie—focusing on the city of Los Angeles rather than his communist-leaning politics and Dustbowl tragedy narratives. American Songwriters Evan Schlansky noted the same apolitical tone of the lyrics, but qualified that with Yames' delivery on \\"My Revolutionary Mind\\". He praised the album's diversity as a strength, allowing each vocalist an opportunity to display his unique talents. Writing for Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis agrees that the songwriting diversity is a strength, comparing individual tracks with R.E.M., The Velvet Underground, Richard Thompson, and John Mellencamp.

Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... Question: How did the prison population drop below 1.5 million? Options: - There was a sharp increase in the number of inmates in federal prisons. - Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years. - not enough information - Tough-on-crime policies were enacted in the 1990s. The answer is:","output":"Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years. The context provided states that the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade, and this decline was attributed to sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade.

Led by a stellar performance from Liam Williams, who scored two tries, Scarlets defeated the reigning champions Connacht, leaving the Irish side winless at the bottom of the table. Body: 1. A turn of events for Scarlets Before this match, Scarlets had endured a challenging start to their season. However, the much-needed win against Connacht could potentially signal a turnaround in their fortunes. The victory instilled a fresh sense of belief and confidence within the squad and provided a morale boost to the players, coaching staff, and supporters. 2. Liam Williams shines in the victory The star of the match was undoubtedly Liam Williams, who scored two crucial tries that ultimately sealed the victory for Scarlets. As a versatile winger and full-back, Williams showcased his skill set and rugby intelligence throughout the game to help his team secure the crucial points that led to their first win. 3. Connacht's early season struggles The outcome of the match leaves the defending champions, Connacht, winless in their current Pro12 campaign. As the title-holders, the pressure is on for the Irish side to improve their performance and recover from their sluggish start. Coach Pat Lam will undoubtedly be looking for ways to motivate his side to turn their season around and climb up from the bottom of the league table. 4. Potential turning point for both teams This match outcome may serve as a critical turning point for both Scarlets and Connacht. With their first win in hand, Scarlets could carry their newfound momentum into future matches and continue climbing the ranks. Simultaneously, Connacht may well take this humbling defeat as a wakeup call, revisiting their training and strategies, to ensure they do not fall further behind in their title defence. Conclusion: In what could prove to be a pivotal match for both teams, Liam Williams' heroics led Scarlets to their inaugural win of the Pro12 2016-17 season, relegating defending champions Connacht to the bottom of the table without a victory to their name. With plenty of games left in the season, it remains to be seen how both teams will build upon this contest's outcome, ultimately shaping their respective campaigns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. What event led to former President Barack Obama suspending military sales with Nigeria? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - fighting terrorism - not enough information - allegations of human rights abuse in Nigeria - vulgar comments referring to African countries The answer to this question is:","output":"allegations of human rights abuse in Nigeria.

Question: For a commuter rushito catch a train, a minute can mean the difference between dinner with the family and foods in the microwave. What most passengers don't realize is that their minute is already there.     Every commuter train that departs from New York Cityabout 900 a d leaves a minute later than scheduled. If the timetable says 8:14, the train will actually leave at 8:15.In other words, if you think you have only a minute to get that trainwell, relax. You have two.     The courtesy minute , in place for decades and published only in private timetables for employees, is meant for those who need the extra time to get off the platform and onto the train.     \\"If everyone knows they get an extra minute, they're going to waste time doing unimportant things,\\" explained Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metro-North Railroad. Told of this article, Ms. Anders laughed. \\"Don't blow our cover!\\"she said.     Entirely hidden from the riding public, the secret minute is an odd departure from the railroad culture of down-to-the-second accuracy. The railroad industry helped invent the concept* of standard time, and time zones were established in the United States in the 1880s, 35 years before they were written into law. And most commuters know their train by the accurate minute it departs. The trains quickly make up the minute:at all other stops, the public timetable is carried out. The courtesy minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades.     \\"That's been done forever, from my knowledge,\\" said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial historian of Metro-North. \\"I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case since 1870 for all I know.\\" What can we conclude from the passage? A) The courtesy minute exists in many cities in the US. B) The train will reach the destination one minute late. C) .Most railroad staff in New York know the courtesy minute.

How was the character Subtle known in the title of a play by Ben Jonson????","output":"The character Subtle is known in the title of a play by Ben Jonson as \\"The Alchemist.\\" The full title of the play is \\"The Alchymist, or the Comical Elixir: A Comedy.\\" Ben Jonson, an accomplished Elizabethan playwright, wrote this Jacobean-era play in 1610. It is a satirical comedy that underscores the greed, gullibility, and folly of the English society of the time. Subtle, the Alchemist, is one of the primary characters in the play. He conspires with two other principal characters, Face (a butler named Jeremy) and Dol Common (a prostitute), to swindle their targets by taking advantage of their desire to achieve quick wealth and social success. Subtle presents himself as a knowledgeable, skilled, and well-connected alchemist who can transform base metals into gold, perform mystical healing, and engage in various pursuits of self-improvement. Throughout the play, Subtle's primary role is to manipulate his targets through elaborate schemes and false promises, extracting wealth and even high social status from them. He pretends to have connections with various influential figures, access to information about royalty, and insight into secret techniques for advancing one's position in life. By feigning expertise in alchemy, astrology, and other supernatural fields, Subtle gains the trust of his victims and leads them further into his elaborate con. His character serves to criticize the widespread interest in occultism and supernatural practices that thrived during the Renaissance, as well as the human tendency to be excessively greedy, especially those who sought shortcuts to wealth and power. The Alchemist demonstrates the pitfalls of such beliefs and behaviors while entertaining its audience with Subtle's cunning schemes and the comical interactions between the characters. Ben Jonson's play explores themes of deceit, exploitation, and personal ambition, painting a portrait of a society where people were easily swayed by the allure of quick solutions to their problems. Through Subtle, Jonson reminds the audience about the importance of vigilance, skepticism, and awareness of our own vulnerabilities. By presenting these lessons in a humorous and satirical manner, Jonson effectively conveys a moral message while keeping his audience engaged in this delightful farce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  and a hint : The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Please answer this question : Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Jessica's plan? A:","output":"Under Jessica's plan, the number of animals is likely to decrease. Her proposal to emit more anthropogenic gases would exacerbate the issues associated with global warming and climate change. As the Earth's atmosphere becomes more saturated with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the greenhouse effect would intensify, leading to a rapid increase in global temperatures. As mentioned in the given information, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected a significant rise in global temperatures by 2100. This increase in temperature would have a wide range of negative impacts on the environment and wildlife populations. Warmer temperatures can result in the loss of natural habitats, such as ice caps, coral reefs, and forests. These habitats are crucial for the survival of countless animal species. Furthermore, the changing climate conditions can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and food chains, leading to an imbalance in predator-prey relationships, competition for resources, and increased vulnerability to diseases. These factors can contribute to a decline in animal populations and potentially drive some species towards extinction. Additionally, extreme weather events, which are expected to become more frequent due to climate change, can cause significant harm to animal populations by disrupting their habitats and causing injury or death. In conclusion, Jessica's plan to emit more anthropogenic gases would likely lead to a decrease in animal populations due to the exacerbation of global warming, the consequent loss of natural habitats, disrupted ecosystems, and other negative effects on wildlife. Conversely, Milly's proposal of reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere aligns more with the goal of saving the planet and its animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: where does ground pepper come from? Answer:","output":"Ground pepper, a widely used and popular spice across the globe, comes from the dried berries of the Piper nigrum plant. Piper nigrum is a perennial flowering vine, native to Southern India and Sri Lanka, but now cultivated in various tropical regions such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, and Madagascar. The plant bears small, green, unripe berries that turn red as they ripen. The resulting ground pepper differs in color (black, green, or white) depending on the time the berries are harvested and the processing method employed. Black ground pepper, which is the most common variety, is derived from the unripe green berries of the Piper nigrum plant. These berries are harvested and then blanched briefly in boiling water, a process that activates the enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the outer skin, promoting its dark coloration. The berries are then spread out in the sun or other drying methods to dry over several days. The outer skin wrinkles, and the remaining seed dries out, developing its characteristic black color and distinct pungent aroma. Once fully dried, the berries, known as black peppercorns, are ground to produce black ground pepper. Green ground pepper is produced from fresh green berries that are harvested before they ripen. Rather than being dried, these unripe berries are treated to preserve their green color, either through freeze-drying or by soaking them in a saltwater or vinegar solution. This process retains the green hue and a milder, herbaceous flavor profile compared to black pepper. After preservation, green peppercorns are ground into green ground pepper. White ground pepper, on the other hand, comes from ripe red berries. The red berries are harvested at full maturity and soaked in water for an extended period, a process that softens and loosens their outer skin. The outer skin is then removed, leaving behind the inner seed, which is pale in color. These seeds are then dried and ground to create white ground pepper. This variety has a milder and slightly less pungent flavor compared to black pepper. All three varieties (black, green, and white) of ground pepper are used in various cuisines worldwide, each imparting unique flavors to culinary dishes. Today, ground pepper is not only a primary seasoning ingredient in countless recipes but also a staple condiment on restaurant tables and in home kitchens. As a testament to its universal appeal, ground pepper remains one of the most traded commodities in the global spice market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn William Shakspeare's obscure, rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s-era musical, with the result being both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as Costard but is badly mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone who handles the Shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged Valley Girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school English class.

But Nichelle Nichols might have left to pursue a career on Broadway were it not for the intervention of a very unlikely Trekkie - Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Although he's best known for his rousing speeches promising a future of freedom and equality for downpressed African Americans, it transpires the civil rights leader also had in mind a far more distant future. Trailblazers: Nichelle Nichols is pictured left as Lieutenant Uhura, on board the Star Ship Enterprise. She nearly left the role after the show's first season until Dr Martin Luther King, right, persuaded her to stay. 'He said, \\"You have one of the most important roles, this is a first. It's non-stereotypical, it's brilliant, it's beauty and it's intelligence\\",' Nichols told Neil DeGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and broadcaster. 'He said, \\"You cannot leave, do you understand? It has been heavenly ordained. This is God's gift and onus for you. You have changed the face of television forever.\\" Now 82, Nichols 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time. It was the era of the Black Panthers, and of race riots in Watts, Newark and Detroit, as black communities fought to realise the potential of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts passed to enshrine equality in law. Nichols pictured in 2010: Her 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time. But even with all the turmoil of the age, Nichols hadn't fully grasped the racial and cultural implications of her Star Trek role, still thinking of herself as just a cast member on the show. In fact, she had already decided to move on from the role and even handed her letter of resignation to producer Gene Roddenberry when she met King. 'I had been invited as a celebrity guest at a NAACP fundraiser in Beverly Hills,' she told Tyson, in the interview first aired in 2011 but still available on his website. 'One of the promoters came up and said someone wanted to meet me. He said he's your greatest fan ... I'm thinking it's a Trekker, maybe a child, maybe a young man. 'And so I turned and I see this man across the room with this brilliant smile, which you didn't often see on his face. And I remember saying to myself, 'Whoever this little Trekker is they're going to have to wait because this is my leader, Dr Martin Luther King, walking towards me with a smile on his face.\\" 'And he walks to me and with this smile he says, \\"Miss Nichols, I am your greatest fan.\\"' Nichols says King spoke to her about her role in Star Trek and how important it was to the future of the civil rights movement. He praised Roddenberry, the producer, as a visionary, adding 'we [black people] are there, because you are there.' Said to be one of the first black women to appear in a major television series in a role not portraying a servant, Nichols did prove to be an inspiration to a generation of young people. Mae Jemison, an American doctor who became the first black woman in space on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992, has said she was she was inspired to join Nasa by Nichols' portrayal of Uhura. And Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show. Groundbreaking: Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on American network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show. After Star Trek's cancellation after three seasons amid failing ratings, Nichols volunteered her time to Nasa for a special project to recruit ethnic-minority and female personnel for the agency.

On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process is the synthesis of glucose and other organic molecules. After the water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen, the hydrogen is then combined with carbon dioxide in a series of reactions known as the Calvin Cycle. During this cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into an organic molecule through a process called carbon fixation. The energy that was absorbed by chlorophyll and transformed during the light-dependent reactions (the splitting of water) is used to power the formation of glucose and other carbohydrates from the fixed carbon.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Secretariat (March 30, 1970 - October 4, 1989) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. His record-breaking win in the Belmont Stakes, where he left the field 31 lengths behind him, is widely regarded as one of the greatest races of all time. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. He was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. The syndication deal for Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older horses in the Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen in part because of long-time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.  The day of the race was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a \\"virtual hysteria\\" that Secretariat seemed not to notice. His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, who he had already beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had finished third in the Man o' War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. \\"Snorting steam in the raw twilight\\", he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by  6 1/2 lengths. Once again, many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir hunters.  After the race, Secretariat was brought to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. \\"It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day\\", said Laurin. \\"I certainly wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse and he loves to run.\\"  Altogether, Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races, with three seconds and one third, and total earnings of 1,316,808.  For 1973, Secretariat was again named Horse of the Year, and won Eclipse Awards as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the American Champion Male Turf Horse. what happened there?","output":"In the Canadian International Stakes, which was Secretariat's last race, he competed against older horses on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Add spaces: Tocotrienolsalsoseemtobeapowerfulwatchdogagainstbothoestrogenpositiveandoestrogennegativebreastcancercells.","output":"Tocotrienols also seem to be a powerful watchdog against both oestrogen positive and oestrogen negative breast cancer cells. Tocotrienols are a group of compounds found in the Vitamin E family, which are known for their strong antioxidant properties and potential health benefits. Studies have shown that these compounds may have a significant impact on reducing the risk and progression of various types of cancers, including breast cancer.  Breast cancer is classified into two primary categories based on the presence or absence of oestrogen receptors. Oestrogen positive breast cancers have oestrogen receptors on their surface, while oestrogen negative breast cancers do not. The presence or absence of these hormone receptors plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate treatment and prognosis for individuals with breast cancer.  Research suggests that tocotrienols exhibit a protective effect against both oestrogen positive and oestrogen negative breast cancer cells. The following are some key points about how tocotrienols work against these cancer cells: 1. Antioxidant activity: The potent antioxidant properties of tocotrienols neutralize harmful free radicals and promote cellular health. By doing so, tocotrienols may prevent oxidative damage to the DNA of cells, potentially reducing the risk of mutations that can lead to cancer. 2. Anti-proliferative effect: Tocotrienols have been found to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, including breast cancer cells, by suppressing key enzymes and signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and growth. This may help slow down or halt the progression of the disease. 3. Induction of apoptosis: Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is a natural process that is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Tocotrienols can induce apoptosis in cancer cells, including breast cancer cells, by triggering a chain of reactions that ultimately lead to the destruction of these cells. This can help prevent cancer from spreading further. 4. Inhibition of metastasis: Metastasis is the process by which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor site to other parts of the body. Tocotrienols have been shown to inhibit the migration, invasion, and adhesion of breast cancer cells, potentially reducing the risk of metastatic progression. 5. Hormone-mediated effects: Tocotrienols have been shown to exhibit hormone-mediated effects that can potentially impact the growth and proliferation of oestrogen positive breast cancer cells. They may modulate hormone signalling pathways or directly interact with oestrogen receptors, blocking the effects of oestrogen and thus inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. In conclusion, tocotrienols appear to be a powerful watchdog against both oestrogen positive and oestrogen negative breast cancer cells, demonstrating their potential as a therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of this prevalent disease. Furthermore, tocotrienols may be beneficial for overall health due to their antioxidant properties and ability to support the immune system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  Now, I have a new situation: Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies.  Answer this question please: Which town had more evaporated and unused fuel? A:","output":"Considering the provided background information and the given situation, it can be deduced that Hill town had more evaporated and unused fuel. This conclusion is based on the fact that Hill town was full of gasoline-powered vehicles, which, as stated in the background, release evaporated and unused fuel into the atmosphere, contributing to smog formation. The emissions from these vehicles contain volatile hydrocarbons that are released when gasoline evaporates or when fuel remains unburned. On the other hand, Valley town banned all gas-powered vehicles and allowed only electric vehicles or horse-and-buggies. Electric vehicles do not run on gasoline, so there would be no evaporated or unused fuel emissions from these vehicles. Horse-and-buggies, being a non-motorized mode of transport, do not produce evaporated and unused fuel emissions either. Thus, it is evident that Hill town, with its prevalent gasoline-powered vehicles, had a higher amount of evaporated and unused fuel emissions compared to Valley town, which utilized cleaner modes of transportation, resulting in fewer pollutants being released into the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Not all hiking trips will be the same and there are varying styles of backpacks that can meet the demands of these differences.  Depending on the length of your hike and the gear you need to carry you will need to purchase a backpack with the correct frame style.  Backpacks with external frames are mainly used for heavy and asymmetrical loads. An internal frame backpack might be right for you if you need to maintain stability and don't need to carry heavy items. Frame-less backpacks are for those hikers who don't need to carry much gear with them and like to move quickly on their hike. Hiking backpacks will need to be fitted exactly to the size of your torso.  Any backpack that isn't the right size won't fit correctly and will be uncomfortable or may cause injury.  Measure your torso's length and hip width before you buy your backpack to ensure a great fit.  Measure your torso's length by starting from the top bump at the base of your neck down to your hip level. Measure your hips to make sure that the hip belt will fit.  Your hip measurement will be taken just above where your pants normally rest. Before you load up your backpack and head out hiking you will need to properly fit your backpack.  Try wearing your backpack and then making adjustments using the straps on your backpack where needed.  There will generally be four main areas to adjust including the hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps.  The hip-belt should fit snugly around your hips and will support much of the weight. Shoulder straps should pull the bag tight against your back but not actually carry much of the weight. Some backpacks will have load-lifting straps.  These should relieve the weight from your shoulders and help keep it properly distributed. The sternum strap will pull the weight up and away from your shoulders and should fight tightly and comfortably across your chest. When it comes to hiking backpacks, it is ideal to visit a store where you can try on the backpacks in person.  Although you might know your measurements, each backpack might fight differently in actuality.  Try on plenty of backpacks before purchasing one to make sure you find the right fit. If you are unable to visit a store you may still be able to try a backpack and return it free of charge if the manufacturer allows for it. Summary:","output":"Hiking backpacks come in different styles, including external frame, internal frame, and frame-less, to cater to varying hike lengths, gear requirements, and hiker preferences. To ensure the right fit, measure your torso length and hip width before purchasing a backpack. Proper fitting involves adjusting the hip-belt, shoulder straps, load lifters, and sternum straps as necessary. Ideally, try on backpacks in a store for the best fit, or choose a manufacturer that allows returns if the fit is not right."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Question: Given the following context:  In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the recycling process, as described, involves the collection and transportation of recyclable materials to a recycling center. This step typically starts at residential homes and businesses, where individuals and employees are responsible for sorting out recyclable materials from the rest of their waste. These materials commonly include paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, and metals.  In many urban areas, local waste management organizations provide special recycling bins to households and offices for segregating recyclables from the general waste stream. Some localities may also have separate containers for different types of materials.  Once the recyclables are sorted, they are picked up by waste management services or, in some cases, this collection service might be performed by specialized recycling companies. There may also be local recycling stations or drop-off locations where individuals can bring their recyclables if curbside pickup is not available.  The collected materials are then transported to a recycling center. This might involve smaller local collection vehicles transferring their loads to larger vehicles for more efficient transport. In some cases, the recyclable materials might also be sorted into different categories at a local level before being sent for recycling. This step is crucial for the entire process: if waste is not correctly sorted and collected, it cannot be recycled, and the items may end up in a landfill instead. Therefore, raising awareness about proper waste disposal and recycling habits can play a significant part in making the recycling process more efficient and effective.  At this stage, it is also pivotal to note that not all materials are recyclable, and even among those that are, the feasibility and methods of recycling can vary. Some materials, like certain types of plastic, are difficult to recycle and may require special facilities or processes.  In conclusion, the first step in the recycling process is the collection and transportation of recyclable materials to a recycling center. This step involves many sub-steps including public education on the types of materials that are recyclable, separation of these materials from other waste forms, and the efficient collection and transportation of these materials to the recycling center."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"North Korea reportedly relieves top army chief of posts\\" Article:","output":"Title: North Korea reportedly relieves top army chief of posts Introduction: In a surprise move, North Korea has reportedly relieved its top-ranking army chief of his various posts. The unexpected action has sparked a slew of speculations and analyses on the consequences and rationale behind such a decision. In this article, we aim to shed light on the possible factors behind this development and discuss the implications of this change for North Korea's military and political structure. Reasons behind the decision: 1. Internal power struggles: One plausible reason for the dismissal of the army chief could be internal power struggles within the North Korean regime. The top brass in the army wield significant influence and authority, making them potential competitors to the supreme leader, Kim Jong-un. As a result, removing such a figure might be a preemptive measure by Kim to maintain his grip on power and quash potential dissent within the ranks. 2. Performance-related issues: It is also possible that the dismissal is related to the army chief's performance. North Korea has faced numerous challenges, including economic sanctions, famine, and international pressure. If the army chief is deemed incapable of managing and addressing these challenges, a change in leadership becomes crucial to improve the situation. 3. Shift in military strategy: Another reason might be a shift in North Korea's military strategy. The regime could be reevaluating its policies and adapting its approach due to new external factors, such as evolving global dynamics, technological advancements, or ongoing diplomatic efforts. In such cases, a new army chief could bring fresh perspectives and align the military with these changes. Implications for North Korea's military and political structure: 1. Centralization of power: The removal of the army chief could lead to the further centralization of power in Kim Jong-un's hands. By purging potential challengers, Kim can ensure that he maintains absolute control over both the military and political domains, tightening his grip over the entire nation. 2. Potential for instability: Such a sudden change in the military's top leadership could create internal rifts and tensions among different factions. In the short term, this might have implications on the stability and morale among the military ranks, potentially leading to discontent and unrest. 3. Impact on diplomatic efforts: The dismissal might have consequences for North Korea's ongoing diplomatic efforts with countries like South Korea and the United States. If the new army chief is seen as an advocate for aggressive military measures, it could hamper negotiations and discords, exacerbating existing tensions in the region. Conclusion: The reported removal of North Korea's top army chief warrants attention and vigilance from both regional and global observers. While the motivations behind such a decision may not be fully known, the consequences of this development have the potential to unsettle regional dynamics and reshape North Korea's internal power structures. Understanding those implications and monitoring further developments within the reclusive nation are essential for maintaining stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please don't answer external factors like pollinators. \\"What external and internal factors have caused the Roma people in Europe to suffer consistently high rates of poverty while 'natives' thrive?\\" OPTIONS:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is focused on the biological aspect of the nocturnal flowers and seeks to understand the internal mechanisms that cause them to bloom at night. It is specifically interested in the physiological and genetic factors that enable these plants to exhibit this distinct behavior. Answer to the first question: Nocturnal flowers open their blooms at night due to a set of internal mechanisms and genetic factors. These factors consist primarily of circadian rhythms, phytohormones, and the genes responsible for the nocturnal behavior of plants. Circadian rhythms are biological processes that follow a 24-hour cycle, allowing organisms to adapt to the daily cycles of light and darkness. Plant circadian rhythms control various aspects of growth, including the opening and closing of flowers. In nocturnal flowers, their circadian rhythms are regulated in such a way that they promote blooming during the nighttime hours. Phytohormones (plant hormones) play a significant role in the blooming of flowers. These hormones, such as auxins, gibberellins, and abscisic acid, help regulate the processes that ultimately lead to flowers opening and closing. In nocturnal flowers, the balance and interactions between these hormones are modulated to promote nighttime blooming. Lastly, the genetic factors responsible for the nocturnal behavior of flowers lie in specific genes that control their daily rhythms. These specific genes and their expressions, under the influence of external factors such as light quality and temperature, coordinate the plant's circadian rhythms and promote nighttime blooming. The second question is centered on the social, cultural, and economic aspects of the Roma people in Europe. It aims to understand both external and internal factors that have contributed to their consistently high rates of poverty compared to the 'natives.' Answer to the second question: The Roma people in Europe have consistently experienced high rates of poverty due to a complex interplay of external and internal factors. These factors can be broadly categorized into social, cultural, economic, and political aspects. External factors: 1. Discrimination and prejudice: The Roma people have faced long-standing discrimination and prejudice throughout history. This marginalization has limited their access to education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. 2. Integration challenges: Due to their nomadic lifestyle, language barriers, and cultural differences, the Roma people often face difficulties integrating into mainstream society. This contributes to the isolation and discrimination that they experience, which further exacerbates their economic status. Internal factors: 1. Traditional lifestyle and values: Some Roma communities adhere to a traditional lifestyle that may not prioritize formal education or steady employment. This can create challenges when attempting to integrate into a modern, competitive economy. 2. Access to resources and support: In some cases, Roma communities may have limited access to resources and support systems within their own community or from external sources. This disadvantage can hinder social and economic mobility, perpetuating poverty within the Roma population. Though these questions are both examining causes of different phenomena, they are not exploring the same meaning or topic. One question is related to the science of nocturnal plant biology, while the other investigates societal issues concerning the Roma people in Europe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A 'nervous, happy and desperate to get on with it' Nick Grimshaw made his debut as the new host of the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show today. The Oldham-native, 28, took to the microphone at 6.30am for his first day, kicking off the show with Kanye West and Jay-Z's duet N***** In Paris. Before his first track, Nick introduced himself: 'So this is happening, it's actually happening. Good morning Britain, I'm Nick Grimshaw. Scroll down for video. New boy: Nick Grimshaw looks contemplative on his first day hosting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. 'It's time to follow in the footsteps. of people I like, like Chris Moyles and Sara Cox. I'm nervous, happy. and desperate to get on with it. 'It's. time to start the difficult job of talking between records. I've been. dreaming about this since I was a little boy. Let's do it.' Nick's appointment in the role comes after previous breakfast show host Chris Moyles left following eight and half years. Nick himself had previously hosted a late night show before his new role was announced in July. Support: Fellow Radio 1 DJs (L-R) Scott Mills, Fearne Cotton, Dev, Zane Lowe and Huw Stephens came to visit. Although Nick played the radio edit. of the foul-mouthed Jay-Z and Kanye track, he joked if he had played the. unedited version it would have been 'the world's shortest stint on the Radio 1 breakfast show - three and a half minutes'. Among. the celebrity guests on the show were his good friend Harry Styles, who. talked about One Direction's new video and album on the phone, and a. pre-recorded interview with Justin Bieber. Nick ended up teasing a mumbling Harry by playing a brief bit of the wrong track instead of One Direction's new song Live While We're Young, joking: 'Sorry, my finger slipped.' After fellow Radio 1 DJ Fearne Cotton later noted Harry didn't sound too happy by Nick's 'slip-up', the new breakfast show host replied: 'After he said Radio 1 instead of Capital Radio by mistake at the Brit Awards, he needs us - where else is he going to go? \\"Oh I’m just popping into Heart\\" – I don’t think so!' Time to get up! Nick was greeted by people in chicken costumes for his first morning on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. Ahead of his arrival at the Radio 1 studios in central London, Nick was greeted outside the building by two people in chicken costumes, who gave him a year's supply of Kenco coffee to help him get up in the morning. Speaking to Radio 1’s Newsbeat after the show, he said: “It feels weird, I feel a relief now, the first day is done and it was the first show. Obviously a lot of people were waiting to hear it and there was a lot of anticipation of what the show would sound like, so yes it’s good to get the first one done. 'Today I guess was a lot like an introduction and repeating myself, saying my name a lot. Tomorrow I can do a more regular show and tell a few more stories.' On his own: Nick is the main star of the show, in contrast to Chris Moyles's 'zoo' format. 'In between the celeb guests, Nick was funny, cool, collected, and played actual - gasp - music.' Now magazine. 'Grimmy’s first show was fast-paced, full of celebrity banter and, most importantly, fun.' Daily Mirror. 'A promising start – and a clear break from what went before. It was out with dad rock, cynicism and bloatedly self-indulgent banter; in with dance beats, youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music... The show has swapped one who prefers music to the sound of his own voice; one much more in touch with its target audience of teens and twentysomethings.' Daily Telegraph. 'The message in the opening show – which was a likeable mix of music, self-deprecating chat, interaction on social media, interviews, silly features and funny, often quite bitchy quips – was that the power here has shifted and lies squarely in the music... A very promising, refreshing start that politely suggested the over-30s might like to retune.' The Guardian. The T4 presenter's new role on the breakfast show is a bid to lower Radio 1's demographic after a report by the BBC Trust found the station needed to work harder to attract younger listeners. In research published last November, it was claimed the average Radio 1 listener was 32 and went up to 33 for 38-year-old Moyles' breakfast show. In a bid to attract younger listeners, the music policy seems a lot younger, with a heavier dance influence than had been broadcast on Moyles' show. Nick will aim to play between eight to 10 songs an hour - double the amount played on Moyles' show. Instead of Moyles' 'zoo' format of his production team, the Grimes show will mostly feature his voice with more phone-ins from the audience. Nick previously admitted he had problems. getting up in the morning and told his listeners he had bought a. wake-up light that gradually uses light and bird song to wake him up. gently in the morning. Showing. there was no hard feelings, Chris actually sent a good luck gift to. Nick, who read out the card live on air: 'Good luck with the new show,. enjoy it see you soon, from Chris, former owner of the breakfast show.' Nick told his listeners: 'Ahh! I texted him on holiday and said \\"Thank you for being nice to me in the paper.\\" 'Chris replied, \\"You'll be great, but not as great as me.\\" 'And. now he's sent me some cakes, thank you Christopher, very nice. No. pressure. And weird to not listen to him in the morning! I used to be. able to tell how late I was based on which feature.' Friendly face: Nick's close friend Pixie Geldof and her dog paid a visit to the Radio 1 studios. One of his biggest cheerleaders was close friend Pixie Geldof, who woke up early to listen to her pal, before heading in to visit him at the studio at the end of his shift. She. wrote on Twitter: 'Up early for @grimmers !!!!! So proud!!! Epic music. at the beginning of the radio one breakfast show with NICK GRIMSHAW! '@grimmers obsessed with when they say \\"radio 1 breakfast show with nick grimshaw\\" so emo.' Among those to give him praise were veteran DJ Simon Mayo, who presented the R1 morning show from 1987-1993. Simon tweeted: 'Nick Grimshaw sounding a lot less terrified and a lot more organised than I did. In 1987.' End of an era: Chris Moyles and his team (L-R) Pippa Taylor Hackett, Dominic Byrne, Tina Daheley, Aled Jones, Freya Last and Comedy Dave on their last show on September 14. VIDEO: Move over Chris!

Movie title: The Pirate Movie plot: Manuela Alva (Judy Garland), who lives in the small Caribbean village of Calvados, dreams of being swept away by the legendary Pirate, Mack \\"the Black\\" Macoco. However, her aunt and uncle (who have raised her) insist that she marry the town mayor, the rotund and bullying Don Pedro (Walter Slezak). Shortly before her wedding, Manuela visits a nearby town, Port Sebastian. A traveling circus has arrived, and Serafin (Gene Kelly), its handsome leader, flirts with all the girls in the song \\"Nina.\\" When he encounters Manuela, however, he falls in love with her at first sight. Serafin compliments Manuela's beauty and begs her not to marry Don Pedro, but, angered, she hurries away. That night, however, Manuela cannot sleep, and she sneaks out to go see Serafin's show. At the show, Serafin hypnotizes Manuela, thinking that she will admit she loves him. Instead, the hypnotized girl wildly sings and dances about her love for \\"Mack the Black.\\" Serafin awakens Manuela with a kiss, and she flees in horror. On Manuela's wedding day, the traveling players arrive in Calvados. Serafin begs Manuela to join his troupe, and asks her to admit that she loves him. Don Pedro, hearing noise in Manuela's room, arrives at her door, and asks Manuela to go away so that he can teach Serafin a lesson. Serafin recognizes Don Pedro as Macoco, retired and obese. He blackmails Pedro with this information, swearing to tell it to Manuela if Don Pedro forbids the performers from putting on a show. Serafin then decides to pretend to be Macoco in order to win over Manuela. He reveals himself before the whole town as Macoco, then asks Manuela if she will come with him; she again refuses. Still, watching from her window as \\"Macoco\\" dances, she begins to daydream about the pirate. The next day, \\"Macoco\\" threatens to burn down the town if he cannot have Manuela. Finally, she happily agrees to go with him. One of Serafin's troupe accidentally reveals Serafin's plan to Manuela. To get her revenge, she first pretends to seduce Serafin, then attacks him...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Some people say that today, reading is not as important as it was. These days we have photographs, films, radio and television. Why read a description of something when you can look at a photograph? Why read a newspaper when the latest news is brought to us every hour on radio and TV? Photography was certainly a wonderful invention. Photographs can give a very clear idea of places and of people that we have never seen. An encyclopedia   , for example, is always better when it has good illustrations. But we also need words to explain the photographs and drawings. A photograph of an elephant may give us a very good idea of what an elephant looks like, but it tells us nothing about the different sorts of elephants there are and where they are found, their exact size and weight, how they can be useful to man and so on. In the same way, a good film has action, movement, color, and maybe music. These are things we do not find on the printed page. But reading a novel has certain advantages over watching even an excellent feature film. Reading a novel requires imagination. Each of us imagines a story differently. Watching news on television can certainly be exciting. But we need newspapers as well. Some important news stories happen when there are no cameras around. More importantly, a newspaper does not just report the news. It explains why something has been happening. It also contains interesting articles on different subjects. Newspapers are an important part of our lives, if we want to understand what is going on in the places we live as well as in other parts of the world. Reading is very important for information and pleasure. We need to be good readers to enjoy a full life as human beings. Reading is a skill and like other skills, it needs practice. The more we read, the better readers we become. And the better readers we become, the more we enjoy reading! The secret is to get the reading habit. Read at least a little every day.

If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time. But something bothered her.
